# Antioxidant-inhibited mineral transformer oil

## 1. Scope and Applicability

This PCR covers new, liquid, antioxidant-inhibited petroleum mineral transformer insulating oil supplied at the blending/conditioning factory gate. The selected route purchases fully refined hydrotreated naphthenic mineral base oil, meters a DBPC (2,6-di-tert-butyl-p-cresol, BHT) concentrate in mineral transformer oil, blends, filters and when required dehydrates/degasses, tests and releases the finished whole oil. Include the actual receipt, storage, sampling, failed batches, repeated conditioning, packaging and dispatch preparation. At least 70% of the actual whole formulation by mass must be petroleum oil, with that oil its basic constituent; verify the entire recipe, not just hazard-reporting bands. The principal sold functions are dielectric insulation and heat transfer in oil-filled transformers. These are technical product functions with moisture, cleanliness, oxidation and electrical-release requirements, not an incidental application label on an unrestricted white oil. Sources: `iec-mineral-insulating-2020`; `ergon-hyvolt-iii-2021`; `ergon-hyvolt-sds-2024`; `ergon-bht-concentrate`; `enervac-e865a`.

Exclude virgin-base-oil refining from this foreground unit but retain its upstream burden. Exclude crude petroleum, gasolines/jet fuels, naphtha, kerosenes, white spirit, gas/diesel or fuel oils; products principally lubricating sliding surfaces or metal cutting; uninhibited/trace-inhibited products; ester, silicone, GTL or vegetable-oil insulating fluids; recycled/reclaimed/used oils and reinhibition of in-service oil; white medicinal oils; cable/capacitor impregnants; transformer assembly, first filling at customer equipment, operation and end of life. A different purchased antioxidant preparation or base blend requires documented composition/identity and recipe adaptation; it is not a licence to substitute an unresolved mixture with one pure component.

This narrower petroleum insulating-oil category is associated with CPC3.0 33390. Current 33380 is defined by principal friction/metal-cutting use. IEC and manufacturer evidence establish this category's electrical function; the product is not marketed as a fuel or solvent. The actual complete specification, composition, distillation and contract function must distinguish it from classes3331–3338. The cited SDS reports an initial boiling point only; that is not a complete distillation curve and temperature overlap alone cannot decide classification. Keep native33380 and historical broader lubricant/heavy-oil classifications visible for independent adjudication. Neither a native classification nor an IEC label is automatic mapping acceptance. CPCVersion2 explicitly included insulating oils in its broader33380 class; the listed one-to-many correspondence is from CPC Version2 to Version2.1, not directly to Version3.0, and is not a decision for this product under CPC3.0. Sources: `un-cpc3-2025`; `un-cpc2-insulating-counterevidence`.

The product datasheet establishes a real inhibited mineral transformer-oil category, and the concentrate brochure establishes a real whole DBPC/mineral-oil preparation. They do not prove that the cited finished-oil manufacturer uses that exact concentrate or conditioning train; the brochure also discusses in-service maintenance, which this PCR excludes. The chosen new-oil blending boundary is a disclosed method synthesis. An actual application must demonstrate its own new-production formulation, preparation and processing records; no named commercial product recipe or filter medium is inferred.

| classification_refs | CPC 3.0 33390; narrower product and route boundary |
| covered_products | New DBPC-inhibited petroleum mineral transformer oil, blended from actual fully refined hydrotreated naphthenic base and whole inhibitor concentrate, then conditioned and released |
| excluded_products | The distinct material, principal-function, recycling and downstream routes in section1; no entire residual-oil leaf coverage |
| representative_product | Whole liquid inhibited mineral transformer oil with actual contract, blend ticket and batch electrical/chemical acceptance |
| production_route | Purchased fully refined oil and DBPC concentrate → metering/blending → actual filtration/vacuum conditioning → release, packaging/storage and factory dispatch preparation |
| market_state | New bulk or packaged liquid whole oil, at plant; not an oil constituent, emissions surrogate, or provider screening inventory |

## 3. Reference Flow

| Field | Value |
| --- | --- |
| What | Supply complete new inhibited mineral transformer insulating oil at the declared factory acceptance gate |
| How much | 1 kg reference flow of accepted whole liquid oil, excluding detachable packaging |
| How well | Meet actual transformer-oil contract and standard/edition, inhibited state, composition, moisture/particle cleanliness, dielectric, oxidation and sulfur/contamination release requirements |
| How long or cycle | One actual complete production period with uniquely identified first-acceptance cohorts; no assigned transformer service life |
| reference_flow_link | reference_product |

| Field | Value |
| --- | --- |
| Reference amount | 1 |
| Reference product flow | Insulation oil `53bd72ac-2f0a-4d18-aa9f-158c82b3578f` |
| Reference flow property | Mass `93a60a56-a3c8-11da-a746-0800200b9a66` |
| Reference unit group | Units of mass `93a60a57-a4c8-11da-a746-0800200c9a66` |
| Reference unit | kg |
| Required qualifiers | actual site and reporting period; new virgin-petroleum origin and whole recipe/mineral-oil share; hydrotreated naphthenic base and actual upstream gate; DBPC concentrate SKU, carrier, assay and dose; inhibited transformer grade with contract standard/edition and release tests; actual blending/conditioning sequence and number of passes; net mass and temperature/density when volume is used; factory gate and packaging/storage boundary; immutable unique first-acceptance events and original Q/Q0; same-basis mutually exclusive exhaustive D_new/FG_new/L_new destinations and measured conversions; raw/WIP/FG physical stocks and inherited burden vectors by cohort; external returns/retests/old-cohort service links; broad native identity and33380 metadata debt |

Declare every qualifier in consumable dataset context. The selected native whole product includes the at-plant electrical-insulation route and antioxidant formulation; its wider comment also describes other insulating-fluid families. Only the petroleum mineral transformer subset above is applicable. Its numeric dielectric statement, sweeping standard claim, other fluid families and CPC33380 tag do not become PCR acceptance limits. Actual batch evidence must establish grade, mineral composition and provider compatibility separately. Do not replace the whole oil by BHT, a base-oil ingredient, an emission, or the source-defined GLO refinery screening proxy.

## 4. Measurement and Unit Rules

| rule_id | Applies to | Required property | Required unit | Rule |
| --- | --- | --- | --- | --- |
| reference_mass | reference product | Mass `93a60a56-a3c8-11da-a746-0800200b9a66` | kg | Reference is 1 kg accepted whole liquid oil excluding detachable packaging; Q is locked to original unique first-acceptance whole-oil mass, with measured conversions for later basis changes. cp_acceptance measures net mass; volume requires measured batch density at matching temperature, not the example SDS density. |
| same_reference_basis | all inventory rows | Row-specific physical quantity or energy | per 1 kg reference flow | Record raw amounts under the linked protocol, attribute their complete burden vectors to the relevant cohort, then divide once by its original event-locked accepted mass Q or old-cohort Q0, retaining actual failed/rework loads and post-acceptance losses. All cards and protocols declare this same basis. |
| whole_preparation | all inventory rows | Mass with separate constituent subledger | kg | A purchased concentrate is one whole exchange. Its contained BHT and carrier-oil masses describe composition only and are not additional purchased inputs. Keep actual assay, batch variation and residual inhibitor in losses. |

## 5. System Boundary

### Boundary Abstraction

| Field | Value |
| --- | --- |
| declared_starting_condition | Purchased fully hydrotreated naphthenic oil and whole DBPC mineral-oil concentrate at receipt; actual opening raw/WIP/FG stock, packaging and carried burden vectors |
| starting_condition_role | Foreground blending and conditioning boundary, not a zero-burden upstream cutoff |
| product_classification_scope | Narrow new inhibited petroleum transformer-oil category, independently assessed against current CPC3.0 residual exclusions |
| recursive_input_rule | Internal oil recirculation is a stage transfer, not a fresh input or first acceptance. Purchased same-category oil and external returns need origin/state and inherited-burden evidence; used/recycled oil is outside this route |
| upstream_dataset_requirement | Match each whole base oil/concentrate/utility to actual production route, gate, year, geography and amount basis; refining burdens and justified refinery coproduct allocation remain upstream |
| disclosure | Report receipt-to-factory-gate stages, event-locked Q/Q0, complete same-basis D_new/FG_new/L_new bridge, physical and burden stocks, recirculation, returns, test/conditioning losses, source and provider limits |

| rule_id | applies_to | rule | source_ids |
| --- | --- | --- | --- |
| boundary_complete_unit | oil_supply | Include metering/blending, actual heating/vacuum/filtration, storage, all repeated passes, testing, rejected runs, cleaning, packaging and dispatch preparation. Record receipt, blending, conditioning and supply as separate tagged stages inside this integrated unit. Source machine performance is not a mandatory operating recipe. | `enervac-e865a`; `ergon-bht-concentrate` |
| boundary_first_acceptance | reference_product | Q>0 is the sum of whole-oil net kg independently measured at unique first-acceptance events in the declared period, locked to the original event, lot and acceptance basis. Reconcile the same newly accepted cohort with Q = D_new + FG_new + L_new: D_new is dispatch net of linked returns, FG_new is closing accepted FG, and L_new is all other net post-acceptance destinations, including actual net returns not already located in D_new/FG_new, losses, scrap, downgrade, use and closing transfer back to rework/WIP. The destinations must be mutually exclusive, exhaustive and measured on the same original acceptance basis, with measured conversions for composition/water changes. Only evidence of zero other net destinations permits Q = D_new + FG_new. Later losses never lower Q; opening FG, purchased oil, old returns, redelivery, internal loops, repeated tests and reacceptance never create Q. Never-accepted WIP is excluded from FG_new and Q; already accepted material in closing WIP is traced in L_new without a new event. |  |
| boundary_stock_vectors | oil_supply | Maintain raw/WIP/FG masses and exchange-level inherited burden vectors separately at opening and closing; transfers move both. Withdrawals of opening stock bring their recorded inherited burdens; closing stocks retain appropriate upstream and current-stage burdens. Actual failed batches, repeated conditioning, rework and losses retain attributable loads, even when they generate no new Q. Accepted material returned to WIP keeps its original event and burden vector; reacceptance never duplicates feed or Q. Old-cohort storage/retest/return services belong to the original accepted cohort and its original accepted mass Q0. Unknown inherited vectors or original Q0 remain unknown and prohibit normalized corrections. |  |
| boundary_no_downstream | oil_supply | Upstream refining and input transport remain linked backgrounds. Transformer manufacture, onsite filling, service oxidation/reinhibition and final disposal require distinct downstream models; no default longer-life credit is granted. | `iec-mineral-insulating-2020` |

## 6. Process Inventory Structure

### Process Map

| process_id | process_name | inclusion | inclusion_condition | role | quantitative_reference |
| --- | --- | --- | --- | --- | --- |
| oil_supply | Inhibited mineral-oil blending, conditioning and factory supply | required | Actual new mineral transformer-oil route in section1 | Integrated foreground with receipt, blend, condition/test and factory-supply stage tags | per 1 kg reference flow |

Receipt, blending, conditioning/test, and packaging/storage/dispatch records remain separately measured. Internal oil transfers pair equal masses/compositions and corresponding burden vectors; they cancel only on consolidation. External returns are real physical movements and must not be cancelled as internal recirculation. Add one atomic card per actual additional base grade, whole preparation, fuel, heat supply, refrigerant, packaging component, waste or emitted species. Conditional absence requires recorded evidence, not a blank amount. A shared meter never justifies combining different flows.

## 7. Allocation and Co-product Handling

| rule_id | applies_to | rule | source_ids |
| --- | --- | --- | --- |
| allocation_trace_first | oil_supply | Subdivide batches/stages and meter or trace recipe/utility inputs first. Shared blending/vacuum loads use evidenced causal drivers, such as actual measured batch energy and pass time. If a residual common burden needs allocation among genuinely different oil grades, document the physical relationship, its measured shares and sensitivity before use; no universal mass, price or yield coefficient is prescribed. |  |
| allocation_physical_separate | oil_supply | Close unallocated physical mass, water, oil/inhibitor constituents and energy before any environmental-burden allocation. Burden shares sum to one for the eligible outputs but do not scale away physical waste or coproduct mass. Ordinary blending has no invented chemical-reaction yield or reaction sink. |  |
| allocation_recovery | rejected_oil | Waste remains a waste-service interface until actual receiver evidence establishes an independently marketable coproduct. Record recovery quantity, composition, destination and treatment inputs; grant no automatic displacement credit, zero-burden recycled oil or negative treatment amount. Internal recovered oil carries its original burdens and actual extra processing. |  |
| allocation_stock_cohorts | oil_supply | Carry each opening/closing raw/WIP/FG stock's exchange-level burden vector with its physical cohort. Allocate failure/rework, stock losses and actual acceptance-stage service to the relevant accepted cohorts using disclosed evidence. Old-cohort services augment their original cohort vector and use its original accepted mass; they do not inflate current Q or pass into the current new cohort by convenience. |  |

## 8. Foreground Data Collection, Calculation, and Quality Rules

The authoritative Q is the independently measured whole-oil net quantity summed once over unique first-acceptance events at the fixed reference gate, each cohort locked to its immutable original event. Reconcile Q = D_new + FG_new + L_new on that same original acceptance basis for the complete cohort: D_new is net dispatch after linked returns, FG_new is closing accepted finished stock, and L_new covers all other net post-acceptance destinations including actual net returns, loss, scrap, downgrade, use and closing rework/WIP, without overlap with D_new or FG_new. Deduct linked returns from dispatch and locate their remaining net destination once; do not add another gross-return term. The three destination sets are mutually exclusive and exhaustive net states, not gross movements. Document measured conversions for water/composition or basis changes. The two-term bridge is valid only with evidence that every other net destination is zero. Opening FG, internal loops, returns, rework, retests and reacceptance add no Q; post-acceptance losses cannot lower it. Preserve measured event quantities and unresolved bridges. Acceptance Q is a reference-event account, not another external physical output added to dispatches, wastes or stocks. Actual failed/rework loads remain with their causal cohort; subsequent services use original positive Q0, and missing/zero original quantities prohibit normalization.

For release, retain actual standard/edition, grade, full composition and principal contract function; oil/inhibitor identity and assay; net mass; moisture and particle cleanliness; dielectric breakdown/dissipation with sample conditioning; oxidation stability; sulfur/corrosive-sulfur, acidity and contamination tests appropriate to that contract. Use the full applicable standard and actual lab methods during data production. The IEC publisher scope and manufacturer example tables identify relevant tests but do not provide a universal numerical release specification. Source-specific PDS/SDS values and reporting bands, including their differing dates and flash-point values, must not be combined into a fictional common batch.

Lock Q to the sum of unique measured event masses, not dispatch or residual available stock. Reconcile exhaustive mutually exclusive D_new/FG_new/L_new for the same lots on the same original acceptance basis; subtract linked returns from dispatch and locate their net remaining destination once in FG_new or L_new. Retain separately actual-period external exchanges, all raw/WIP/FG stocks, paired internal transfers and original-cohort histories; gross passes and reacceptance add no Q | kg | Each first acceptance, dispatch, return, retest, reacceptance and period stock close | Same actual complete period plus original-cohort histories | Complete blend/condition/release and included factory-supply operations | per 1 kg reference flow | Actual certificates, calibration, immutable event/lot links, complete same-basis destination bridge and inherited vectors |
| cp_residue | oil_supply | external_waste_and_recovery | weighing_and_receiver | each whole residue mass/composition/oil/water/solids; filter tare/retained oil; rejected product; pump drain; stock; receiver and treatment/recovery status | Weigh whole transfers and sample composition; reconcile treatment/recovery receipts and distinguish internal recirculation from external waste | kg | Each waste/recovery transfer and stock close | Same actual reporting period with cohort attribution | Actual separation/cleaning and external receivers | per 1 kg reference flow | Weighing, assays, receiver evidence and no duplicate retained-oil count |
| cp_emission | oil_supply | final_elementary_releases | monitoring_and_balance | actual water/nitrogen/oil-aerosol/each VOC species; medium/subcompartment; particle size; concentration/flow T/P/wet-dry basis; sampling duration; dissolved gas; capture/condensate; uncertainty | Paired concentration/flow monitoring integrated over actual operating periods, or independently checked oil/water/gas constituent balances; retain unknowns and detection limits | kg | Actual monitoring program and each material operating change | Same actual period including startup, vacuum passes and upsets | Actual vacuum exhaust, tanks, blending and control devices | per 1 kg reference flow | Species/size evidence, matched bases, control efficiency records and balanced final releases |

All protocols retain raw physical quantities and cohort tags before one normalization. The table aggregation basis describes the final report, not another division. Keep physical stock accounts and inherited environmental-burden vectors separately; actual multiple recipe inputs and repeated passes are not extra accepted output.

### Calculation Rules

| rule_id | Applies to | Formula or rule | Inputs | Output | source_ids |
| --- | --- | --- | --- | --- | --- |
| accepted_once | reference_product | Q = sum of unique independently measured whole-oil net masses at first-acceptance events in the period. Keep immutable event/lot identity and original acceptance basis; opening FG, never-accepted WIP, purchases, old returns, retests, redelivery, reacceptance and internal throughput add no Q. Reconcile Q = D_new + FG_new + L_new using acceptance_event_bridge; only independently demonstrated zero other net post-acceptance destinations permits the two-term form Q = D_new + FG_new. Losses never shrink the event denominator; preserve original accepted masses Q0 for older cohorts and their services. | cp_acceptance | Positive locked new first-acceptance mass Q and separate original-cohort Q0 |  |
| normalize_once | all inventory rows | For each physical exchange direction i attributable to eligible accepted cohort c, report a_i,c = A_i,c / Q_c once, using actual unallocated physical numerator A_i,c and that cohort's original event-locked accepted mass Q_c. Separately report its attributed environmental-burden vector B_c / Q_c, including inherited loads once, actual failed/rework activities and genuine new services/losses within the declared scope. Old-cohort corrections retain original Q0. Neither loss nor later returns/reacceptance changes Q_c; reference_product=1 kg is an accounting coordinate, not an added external physical output. Neither vector allocation nor stock-service attribution reduces actual physical movements. Do not add raw receipts to stock-corrected consumption or duplicate carried and newly purchased burdens for the same oil. Do not divide physical coproducts by allocation shares. For Q_c=0 or unknown, retain raw numerators, stocks, vectors and unresolved attribution; do not divide, assume zero, discard failed runs or invent Q. | cp_material; cp_utility; cp_packaging; cp_acceptance; cp_residue; cp_emission | Exchanges per 1 kg reference flow by accepted cohort; explicit unresolved zero-output periods |  |
| stock_and_physical | oil_supply | For each stage and the aggregate boundary, opening mass + actual receipts/transfers in = actual transfers/dispatch out + final wastes/emissions + closing mass, with internal links cancelled only at aggregation. Include raw/WIP/FG stocks in this storage-inclusive physical boundary; use actual external dispatch and returns as gross paired records or a consistent net dispatch, never both. First acceptance Q and internal rework/reacceptance are not added external outputs. Keep these actual-period physical amounts separate from the same-acceptance-basis destination bridge, explicitly reconciling measured conversions. Reconcile oil, BHT, carrier oil, water and nitrogen subaccounts and energy separately. Blending/dehydration separates constituents without an invented reaction term. For inherited burden vectors use opening vector + attributable additions = vectors transferred out + closing vector, with actual loss/service attribution documented; a physical closure does not establish an unknown burden vector. | cp_material; cp_utility; cp_packaging; cp_acceptance; cp_residue; cp_emission | Physical and burden ledgers with explained residuals |  |
| preparation_constituents | inhibitor_concentrate | Contained BHT = measured whole concentrate mass multiplied by actual BHT mass fraction; carrier oil and other constituents use their actual measured fractions. Fractions sum to the whole preparation; these are composition subaccounts, not duplicate background purchases. Include inhibitor retained in product, WIP, removed residues and aerosol. | cp_material; cp_acceptance; cp_residue; cp_emission | Whole-preparation and constituent reconciliation | `ergon-bht-concentrate`; `ergon-hyvolt-sds-2024` |
| emission_integrate | oil_mist, vented_water, vented_nitrogen | Integrate matching species concentrations and exhaust flows over real time on the same T/P and wet/dry basis; distinguish captured condensate/retained filter oil from final air release. Dissolved air/nitrogen and residual water are real physical inputs/outputs even where non-characterised bulk air is omitted from impact modelling. Total organic carbon needs actual speciation or explicit unresolved status, not an invented hydrocarbon identity. | cp_emission; cp_residue; cp_utility | Final emitted species and control-device transfers without duplication | `enervac-e865a` |
| acceptance_event_bridge | all inventory rows | Lock Q to the sum of unique independently measured first-acceptance event masses. Check Q = D_new + FG_new + L_new with mutually exclusive exhaustive net destinations of the same cohort on its original acceptance basis: net dispatch after linked returns, closing accepted FG, and all other actual net returns/losses/scrap/downgrades/use/closing rework-WIP. Put linked returned parcels in FG_new or their actual L_new destination once, never a second generic return term. Reconcile measured water/composition/basis changes. For 100 kg first accepted, 60 kg net dispatch, 30 kg closing FG and 10 kg loss, Q=100 kg; 100 burden units/Q=1 unit/kg, whereas the incomplete 90 kg denominator gives an invalid 1.111... . The two-term bridge is valid only when all other net destinations are evidenced zero. Later losses/services retain original Q or Q0, and internal/return/rework/reacceptance throughput adds no Q or external output. Unexplained residuals remain unresolved, never zero loss or a rewritten Q. | cp_acceptance; original acceptance events; same-basis net destination records; original cohort quantities | auditable positive event Q and separate physical stock bridge |  |

### Data Quality Requirements

| requirement_id | Applies to | Requirement | Evidence |
| --- | --- | --- | --- |
| dq_identity | reference_product | Verify whole mineral inhibited oil, actual at-plant gate and electrical principal function; preserve broad native descriptions and contrary33380 metadata rather than silently treating the tag as proof or rejection. | Actual native original, product/contract evidence and independent classification decision |
| dq_recipe | oil_supply | Record actual whole recipe and supplier assays; hazard disclosure bands and source nominal concentrate strengths are not batch composition, universal recipes or production ranges. | Blend tickets, full composition certification and release assays |
| dq_cohorts | oil_supply | Reconcile unique event-locked first acceptance with the complete disjoint same-basis D_new/FG_new/L_new bridge, including post-acceptance losses and actual net-return destinations. Maintain raw/WIP/FG mass and burden histories and actual failed/rework loads once; stock drawdown, retests, returns or reacceptance cannot mint new output or reduce original Q. Preserve original Q0 for old-cohort services and explicit conversion/stock gaps. | Immutable acceptance-event and cohort ledgers, complete net destinations, paired transfers and inherited vectors |
| dq_coverage | oil_supply | Disclose monitoring period, loads, failed batches, missing species/provider bases, unknown opening vectors, zero-output work and measurement uncertainty. An unresolved quantity or identity is not a zero exchange. | Actual records and explicit gap register |

## 9. Validation Rules

| rule_id | applies_to | rule | source_ids |
| --- | --- | --- | --- |
| validate_reference | reference_product | Require one whole finished mineral-oil reference with net mass, real full Product/Mass/kg chain and declared route/gate; reject ingredient, emission, provider inventory, hard opposing family or unverified whole identity. |  |
| validate_applicability | oil_supply | Verify new petroleum origin, actual inhibited transformer function, full recipe/mineral share and agreed release standard/edition. A generic name or native33380 tag cannot settle current33390; retain actual physical/specification and principal-function evidence for independent decision. | `un-cpc3-2025`; `iec-mineral-insulating-2020`; `ergon-hyvolt-iii-2021` |
| validate_ledger | oil_supply | Check unique first-acceptance event masses, positive finite original denominator, exhaustive mutually exclusive same-basis D_new/FG_new/L_new, measured basis conversions and original-cohort Q0 service attribution. Reject shrinking Q after losses or minting Q from opening FG, net returns, WIP transfers or reacceptance. Retain actual failed/rework loads, physical raw/WIP/FG stocks and inherited vectors, complete atomic exchanges, whole concentrate accounting and no double-normalization. Acceptance events are not additional external physical outputs. Unsupported inherited burden or unexplained bridge residual remains unresolved even when physical mass closes; zero/unknown Q supports raw records only. |  |
| validate_interfaces | oil_supply | Check stage links, actual conditioning passes, water/gas/oil constituent closure, receiver/compartment and provider quantity basis. Reject duplicate retained oil, whole concentrate plus its carrier purchase, arbitrary credits or unmeasured-zero releases. | `enervac-e865a`; `ergon-bht-concentrate` |
