# Generation and characterized handoff of aqueous caesium-137 calibration residues

## 1. Scope and Applicability

This attributional PCR covers one source-segregated aqueous caesium-137 chloride residual stream formed by the actual civil use of a certified hydrochloric-acid-matrix calibration solution, followed by characterization, first release for a named receiver and attributable on-site containment/handoff. The liquid must demonstrably meet that receiver system's documented low- or intermediate-level radioactive-liquid category. A generic native name or Cs-137 content alone does not prove classification. The reference is wet residual liquid mass including its actual water, acid and stable carrier, excluding container, separately captured glass and wipes. Residue has no further intended calibration use; no saleability, positive value, clearance or disposal authorization is implied.

Original metrology use and residue formation remain inside the physical foreground. Buying ready-made waste and merely repacking it does not implement this method. Trace the actual source lot, use campaign, no-further-use decision, segregation, characterization, rejection/rework and first handoff readiness. Use existing qualified records; this environmental method supplies no opening, isotope-production, separation, concentration, decontamination or radioactive handling procedures or parameters.

Exclude sealed sources, mixed-nuclide residues, uranium/thorium/plutonium, organic scintillation liquids, sludge, solidified waste, glass as reference, fuel-cycle residues and treatment services as reference. Actual rinse water joining the documented source stream requires measured quantity and compatible resulting matrix, not a prescribed dilution/mixing operation. Actual collection containers must match documented chemical/radiological compatibility and receiver requirements.

NIST documents the real Cs-137 calibration-solution state and distinguishes certified activity from uncertified chemical information. IAEA SSG-45 independently describes aqueous wastes from measurement/research uses and characterization/management records. A producer's different matrix and uncertified chemical purity are countercontext. No source supplies a factory inventory, universal waste threshold, isotope mixture, half-life, residue yield, chemical assay, energy intensity or emission default. The whole native reference is actually Product flow; this retains its physical radioactive-waste status without turning it into a useful calibration solution or a treatment-service output.

## 4. Measurement and Unit Rules

| rule_id | Applies to | Required property | Required unit | Rule |
| --- | --- | --- | --- | --- |
| reference_mass | reference product | Mass `93a60a56-a3c8-11da-a746-0800200b9a66` | kg | Use 1 kg net wet residual liquid, including its actual constituents but excluding container tare and separated solids. Independently weigh each unique first receiver-ready-release event using cp_release; lock its original wet-liquid kg and event genealogy for Q. Later moisture/composition or activity changes do not redefine that event mass. |
| unit_basis | all inventory rows | actual row property | row unit | Preserve raw quantities; 1 kWh = 3.6 MJ and 1000 Bq = 1 kBq. Volume-to-mass conversion requires independent actual same-matrix density and temperature, not a catalog value. Mass uses group `93a60a57-a4c8-11da-a746-0800200c9a66`. Electricity energy group `93a60a57-a3c8-11da-a746-0800200c9a66` has MJ reference. |
| activity_time | finished, cs_air, cs_water | Radioactivity `93a60a56-a3c8-17da-a746-0800200c9a66` | kBq | Keep isotope-specific activity and measurement/reference time, time zone and uncertainty. Group `93a60a57-a3c8-16da-a746-0800200c9a66` has kBq reference. Do not combine parent/daughter activity as Cs-137, infer chemical mass from activity, or invent half-life data. |
| one_normalization | all inventory rows | actual row property | per reference flow | Assign raw exchange burdens and divide by original positive Q exactly once. Q = sum(m_first,e) over unique first receiver-ready-release events e in net wet-liquid kg; never infer Q from dispatch or stocks. Independently reconcile Q = D_new + FG_new + L_new on the same original event basis; only evidenced zero other post-release destinations permits D_new + FG_new. Old FG, returns, retests and re-release add no Q. For Q zero or unknown retain raw loads without a normalized result. |

## 5. System Boundary

Include failed/Q0, start-stop, idle, rejected, cleaning, repeated characterization and rework loads. Cancel only matched internal transfers with equal state, amount, time and inherited vector. | `jrc-ilcd-2010` |
| sb_atomic | all inventory rows | Add each actual energy carrier, chemical, container component, cleaning material, filter, waste stream and environmental species as an individual concrete exchange before claiming completeness. Stock retention and receiver transfer are not environmental discharge. | `iaea-ssg45-2019` |

## 7. Allocation and Co-product Handling

| rule_id | Applies to | Rule | source_ids |
| --- | --- | --- | --- |
| al_subdivide | all inventory rows | Keep gross physical V separate from attributable A. Subdivide metrology use, residue-exclusive characterization/containment and common services using actual source lots, meters and duty records first. | `jrc-ilcd-2010` |
| al_shared | shared source and services | Use evidenced determining physical causality per remaining shared exchange; weights across all co-functions sum to one. Liquid mass alone does not partition calibration service. If causality is unavailable retain the exchange and document a study-consistent justified alternative and sensitivity for review; no complete quantitative claim before closure. | `jrc-ilcd-2010` |
| al_residue | finished | Do not invent a positive residue selling price or confuse a disposal-service payment with product revenue. No automatic avoided material, isotope-recovery or radioactive-decay credit. Physical waste status does not erase original source burdens. | `jrc-ilcd-2010`; `iaea-ssg45-2019` |
| al_cohort | released cohorts | Q is the independently measured sum of unique first receiver-ready-release event wet masses in kg. Reconcile the new cohort through disjoint, exhaustive Q = D_new + FG_new + L_new on its original acceptance basis; losses, disposal, downgrading and accepted material returned to WIP remain traced in L_new, never omitted. Only when all other post-release destinations are evidenced zero may D_new + FG_new be used as a bridge. Old FG dispatch, genuine returns, retests and re-release add no Q. Later storage, failed handoff, repeat characterization and real rework correct the original cohort numerator while retaining its original Q; failed/Q0 loads are not discarded. | `jrc-ilcd-2010` |

The authoritative Q = sum(m_first,e) is the independent sum of calibrated net wet-liquid masses in kg over unique first receiver-ready-release events e at the fixed reference gate. Lock each original event mass, identity and genealogy; dispatch, stock changes, returns and repeated release do not define or increase Q. Reconcile Q = D_new + FG_new + L_new at one cut-off on that same original event basis. D_new is the accepted material still held externally after genuine returns, not gross dispatch; FG_new is the new cohort still held on site in the released, receiver-ready state. L_new is the sum of every other disjoint destination of that accepted material, including irreversible loss, disposal/scrap, downgrading, returned quarantine and accepted material in WIP/rework. Preserve each substate rather than treating L_new as waste alone. A returned parcel belongs once to its final D_new, FG_new or L_new state; returned WIP later released again moves between states and adds no acceptance event. Only when every other post-release destination is evidenced zero may Q = D_new + FG_new be used as a two-term reconciliation, never as an independent Q measurement. Incomplete genealogy or unresolved destinations remain gaps rather than a reduced Q.

These are mutually exclusive, exhaustive shares of originally accepted material, expressed in original wet-liquid acceptance kg. Later water uptake, evaporation or composition changes require separate measured physical exchanges and traceable conversion to that original-material basis; added material cannot inflate Q or the original-material partition. Retain surviving accepted material and its lost portion once; do not restore the survivor to its pre-loss quantity while also recording that loss. Keep actual wet-liquid/constituent/elemental balances, evidenced species transformations and time-referenced nuclide/activity ledgers independent from the event-equivalent bridge. An event-equivalent kg is not a current physical stream, an activity-to-mass conversion or a new external output. Preserve uncertainty and unresolved conversions without a fitted closure plug.

Separate opening already-released FG and its later states by original cohort; they never enter the current period's new Q. Subsequent storage, failed handoff, characterization, loss and rework services retain the original positive Q for that cohort. Pre-first-release WIP and failed/Q0 work retain their actual loads and inherited vectors, but create no Q until a genuine first release. Missing original Q prohibits normalization. This accounting requirement supplies no material-handling or nuclear operating method.

### Data Collection Protocols

| cp_release | residue_generation | finished | raw event and stock ledger | cohort and unique first-event IDs/time; independently measured original event gross/tare/net wet-liquid kg; original locked Q; source genealogy; gross dispatch and genuine returns; disjoint cut-off D_new and receiver-ready FG_new; every L_new substate including loss, disposal/scrap, downgrading, returned quarantine and accepted WIP/rework; opening old released FG and original cohort Q; pre-release WIP and Q0; actual current physical masses and separate original-event-basis conversions; receiving tests/class; assay/nuclides/activity/time/uncertainty | Use calibrated weighing and qualified characterization/receiver records to measure each first receiver-ready event once, independently of dispatch/stocks. Trace each accepted parcel to one final D_new/FG_new/L_new state on its original wet-liquid basis; keep gross return/rework histories and original Q. Reweighing, rework or renewed release never creates Q; retain unresolved destinations/conversions and keep actual physical and activity ledgers separate. | kg; composition; timestamped kBq | each lot, actual interval and stock reconciliation | actual source/use/cohort period and attributable later services | declared generator, source and receiver | per 1 kg reference flow | calibration; raw events/stock; certificates/receiver records; uncertainty |
| cp_energy | residue_generation | electricity | raw event and stock ledger | meter/interval; kWh/MJ; voltage/region/provider; use/characterization duty; idle/start-stop/retest/Q0; shared drivers | Read calibrated meters and matched duty logs; retain raw totals and independent attribution evidence for service/residue functions. Convert kWh to MJ once. | MJ | each lot, actual interval and stock reconciliation | actual source/use/cohort period and attributable later services | declared generator, source and receiver | per 1 kg reference flow | calibration; raw events/stock; certificates/receiver records; uncertainty |

Liquid retained on glass/wipes is not counted again in finished.

All protocols retain unnormalized raw records and independent physical V/attributed A ledgers. Their aggregation denotes the final per-1-kg result after assignment and division by original Q once; never normalize a card again.

### Calculation Rules

| rule_id | Applies to | Formula or rule | Inputs | Output | source_ids |
| --- | --- | --- | --- | --- | --- |
| calc_Q | finished | Q = sum(m_first,e) over unique first receiver-ready-release events e, each independently measured in net wet-liquid kg excluding container/solids; Q > 0 for normalization. Reconcile the separate disjoint exhaustive Q = D_new + FG_new + L_new on the original event basis, including all loss, disposal, downgraded and accepted-WIP states. The two-term bridge requires every other post-release destination evidenced zero. Old FG, returns, retests and repeated release add no Q. Zero/unknown Q keeps raw loads without a unit result. | cp_release | original positive Q or explicit unavailable result | `jrc-ilcd-2010` |
| calc_vectors | all inventory rows | Retain physical V and burden A independently for each exchange. Raw consumption carries opening raw burdens plus actual receipts less closing raw burdens. Carry opening WIP vectors forward, add newly attributable loads, retain closing WIP vectors separately and assign released vectors to original cohorts. Closing released FG already belongs to its locked event cohort: do not subtract its burden again. Already-accepted material returned to WIP retains original Q and inherited vectors; re-release transfers state without new Q. Keep it distinct from never-accepted WIP and retain failed/Q0/rework services. Unknown/incompatible inherited vectors block completeness. | cp_source; cp_release; cp_energy; cp_streams; cp_container | cohort exchange numerators | `jrc-ilcd-2010` |
| calc_once | all inventory rows | Normalized exchange = original-cohort attributable exchange numerator / original positive Q in kg. Numerators retain their own units. Later services add dated corrections to that original numerator with the same original denominator; cumulative corrected results replace prior results instead of adding another product. | cp_release; cp_energy; cp_streams; cp_container; cp_emissions | exchange per 1 kg reference flow | `jrc-ilcd-2010` |
| calc_material | source_solution, rinse_water, finished, glass_waste, wipe_waste, water_air | Reconcile opening stock plus external inputs against closing stock, external outputs and evidenced transformations per material and relevant element. Whole liquid wet mass and nonadditive composition partitions are separate. Chemical species may react, while elemental closure on the declared material basis remains required; identify evidenced nuclear transmutation/daughter terms separately where relevant, without an invented decay-mass conversion. Investigate residuals and retain measurement uncertainty. | cp_source; cp_release; cp_streams; cp_container; cp_emissions | whole-material and elemental ledgers | `nist-cs137-2019`; `iaea-ssg45-2019` |
| calc_activity | finished, cs_air, cs_water | Retain separate nuclide activity ledgers with actual measurement/reference dates. Compare stock/transfer activities only at an evidenced common date using applicable certificate/qualified decay method and supported nuclear data; preserve daughter identity and uncertainty. Activity loss is not missing solution mass. Do not force activity conservation across decay or invent kg-to-Bq factors. | cp_source; cp_release; cp_emissions | time-referenced activity reconciliation | `nist-cs137-2019`; `iaea-ssg45-2019` |
| calc_outlet | cs_air, cs_water, hcl_air, water_air | Integrate matched concentration and outlet-quantity intervals only with compatible units and activity dates. Record actual species/final medium. Transfers to containment/receiver are distinct from direct discharge and never counted again as emissions. | cp_emissions | species/medium-specific external loads | `iaea-ssg45-2019` |
| acceptance_event_bridge | all inventory rows | Lock independently measured unique first-release Q in original wet-liquid kg. At the same cut-off D_new is net externally retained accepted material after genuine returns, FG_new is on-site receiver-ready released stock, and L_new contains every other disjoint accepted-material state: losses, disposal/scrap, downgrading, returned quarantine and accepted WIP/rework. Reconcile Q = D_new + FG_new + L_new with exhaustive parcel genealogy; only evidenced zero for all L_new substates permits the two-term bridge. A returned parcel is located once, and re-release from WIP adds no Q. Keep old opening FG and original cohort Q separate. Retain actual wet-liquid/element/species/nuclide ledgers and later exchange conversions independently; event-equivalent quantities are no extra physical outputs or activity-to-mass factors. Unresolved event, state or conversion evidence blocks complete normalization. Trace original accepted-material constituents separately from measured later additions. Do not restore surviving accepted material to the original Q while also adding the same lost original water or other material in L_new. | original acceptance events; net parcel-state bridge; original cohort quantities | auditable positive event Q and separate physical stock bridge |  |

### Data Quality Requirements

| requirement_id | Applies to | Requirement | Evidence |
| --- | --- | --- | --- |
| dq_identity | finished | Actual source genealogy, matrix assay, no-further-use decision, receiver class and tests required. Chemical purity, nuclide purity and activity are different claims. Native umbrella identity is not a site certificate. | Source/receiver records; NIST/IAEA scope |
| dq_complete | all inventory rows | No invented mass, activity, isotope mixture, half-life or empirical amount ranges. Add missing atomic exchanges and preserve rejected/Q0/stock burdens. Missing important data prevents a complete dataset, not a zero input. | Raw records, calibration, reconciliation and uncertainty |
| dq_provider | all selected flows | Check physical identity, property/unit chain and provider compatibility separately. Unresolved source-solution/container/solid-waste UUIDs remain explicit. No elementary-emission, clean-glass or generic-chemical proxy. | Full native/provider records and actual boundary |

## 9. Validation Rules

| rule_id | Applies to | Rule | source_ids |
| --- | --- | --- | --- |
| val_reference | finished | Require one uniquely linked 1 kg liquid output, complete qualifiers, actual class proof and whole-residue native identity. Do not substitute useful certified solution, solid waste, handling service or pure isotope emission. | `iaea-ssg45-2019` |
| val_account | all inventory rows | Verify independent unique first receiver-ready-release wet-liquid event masses and locked original Q, plus disjoint exhaustive D_new/FG_new/L_new on the same basis with net returns, losses, disposal/scrap, downgrading and accepted WIP/rework. Reject Q inferred from dispatch or closing-FG movements. Allow a two-term reconciliation only when all other destinations are evidenced zero; keep Q measurement independent and reject repeated release as new Q. Reconcile old opening FG separately and retain original cohort Q for subsequent/failed/rework services and inherited vectors. Normalize once; zero/unknown Q or unresolved states/conversions gives no complete unit result. Check source-to-service/residue attribution and shared weights without fictitious residue value; actual material/species/nuclide balances stay independent. | `jrc-ilcd-2010` |
| val_balances | all material and emission rows | Verify whole-material and elemental closure separately from species transformations and time-dependent activity. Inspect liquid retained in solids, container tare, source-water double counting, actual media and nondetect uncertainty. | `nist-cs137-2019`; `iaea-ssg45-2019` |
| val_limits | all inventory rows | No completeness or cradle-to-grave claim with missing upstream burden, attribution, class/receiver or downstream links. This environmental PCR neither certifies safety nor authorizes radioactive activities or discharge. | `iaea-ssg45-2019`; `jrc-ilcd-2010` |
