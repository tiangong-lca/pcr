# White fused alumina abrasive grain manufacture

## 1. Scope and Applicability

This attributional PCR covers one declared grade of virgin white fused alumina abrasive grain manufactured from whole supplied calcined alumina through electric-arc fusion, actual cooling/solidification and corundum crystallization, crushing, separation, screening/grading, any necessary evidenced physical cleaning/drying, inspection and unique first final quality release. Include receipt, internal transfers, controls, utilities, furnace/equipment service, all failures and zero-output runs, start/stop, idle, cleanup and pre-release rework. Packing, finished-grain storage, handling and dispatch are retained in a separate original-cohort service account. Buying finished grain and repacking does not implement this manufacturing boundary.

Natural corundum/emery; brown fused bauxite+coke+iron/ferrosilicon co-production; sintered/tabular/sol-gel alumina; zirconia-alumina and intentionally doped fusion routes; hollow alumina bubbles; gemstone or technical single-crystal sapphire; Bayer refinery alumina as finished reference; bonded whole wheels, coated abrasives, grinding spheres, complete refractory bricks and crucibles; used blasting-grain recycling and downstream use. Acid treatment or surface coating is not presumed; a real additional route needs renewed primary applicability and its separate whole formulation, utilities, emissions and wastes.

ALTEO supports the actual feed and electric-arc route; Washington Mills supports a commercial virgin white fused abrasive terminal and solidified-ingot-to-sized-grain manufacture. EPA supports generic grain processing with optional wet steps, while its bauxite/coke/iron fusion paragraph describes a different route. This is a transparent technical synthesis across sources, not one SKU, plant or current order. No universal purity, temperature, time, current, particle target, recipe, specific energy, electrode rate, yield, density, lifetime, abrasion performance or certification is prescribed. The multi-grade SDS does not reveal every impurity/minor phase; collect the whole actual grade, free moisture and size configuration. `alteo-white-fused-alumina`; `wm-fused-mineral-process`; `wm-duralum-special-white`; `wm-white-alumina-family`; `wm-white-alumina-sds-2025`; `epa-abrasive-manufacturing-1995`

| --- | --- |
| What | Manufacture and first release of whole white fused alumina abrasive grain |
| How much | 1 kg net whole grain |
| How well | Actual declared grain size/chemistry/phase and applicable abrasive specification, passing manufacturer-recorded first final quality acceptance; no universal abrasive performance guarantee |
| How long or cycle | One manufacturing cycle to first release; use life/downstream grinding excluded; subsequent services retain original cohort and observed horizon |
| reference_flow_link | `finished_grain` |

## 4. Measurement and Unit Rules

| rule_id | Applies to | Required property | Required unit | Rule |
| --- | --- | --- | --- | --- |
| reference_mass | reference product | Mass `93a60a56-a3c8-11da-a746-0800200b9a66` | kg | Receipt of whole calcined alumina is the starting condition. Supplier calcination remains upstream unless actually performed inside the reported site; then identify its actual feed state and add the complete calcination inventory. Do not substitute calcined bauxite, hydroxide, natural mineral, purchased finished fused grain or a brown-fused recipe. Preserve the actual cooling/solidification route and all grade processing before first release. |
| native_extensive | each inventory exchange | Each native extensive property; not universally Mass | kg / MJ / m3 as applicable | Materials/species use kg, electrical energy MJ, compressed-air/gas volume m3 at actual conditions. Resolve each unit group/reference unit; do not infer density/item mass from name, secondary property or CAS. Collect original rate/cumulative quantity and convert first; apply calc_normalize once. |
| whole_grade | whole supply and product | Mass `93a60a56-a3c8-11da-a746-0800200b9a66` | kg | Whole preparations and grain retain actual impurities/minor phases and supplied free water. Dry/oxide-equivalent bases are separate analytical accounts; never replace whole product mass with pure Al2O3 mass. |

## 5. System Boundary

### Boundary Abstraction

| Field | Value |
| --- | --- |
| declared_starting_condition | Whole purchased calcined alumina and actual supplied state; actual on-site calcination requires complete added inventory |
| starting_condition_role | Foreground manufacturing receipt gate; supplier mining/Bayer refining/calcination owned upstream unless actually on-site |
| product_classification_scope | Bounded white-fused-grain route within CPC3.0:37960, not all artificial corundum |
| recursive_input_rule | Actual same-category purchased fused input retains its supply state and distinct upstream inventory; no recursive substitution as new manufacture or finished-grain repacking in place of raw-to-grain manufacture |
| upstream_dataset_requirement | Match each actual supplied product/energy/fuel/water/service and waste treatment by technology/geography/time and native property; no duplicate supplier-included/on-site increments |
| disclosure | Declare manufacture/service gates, actual assets/utilities/water-energy conventions, conditional stages, full stock inheritance, allocation and unresolved evidence |

| rule_id | Applies to | Rule | source_ids |
| --- | --- | --- | --- |
| boundary_classification | complete foreground boundary | CPC3.0:37960 names artificial corundum; this method selects a narrower whole white-fused abrasive-grain route on independent physical evidence. Neighbor37910 comprises bonded/coated abrasive articles. A title or native taxonomy is not an accepted mapping. | `un-cpc3-2025` |
| boundary_route | complete foreground boundary | Receipt of whole calcined alumina is the starting condition. Supplier calcination remains upstream unless actually performed inside the reported site; then identify its actual feed state and add the complete calcination inventory. Do not substitute calcined bauxite, hydroxide, natural mineral, purchased finished fused grain or a brown-fused recipe. Preserve the actual cooling/solidification route and all grade processing before first release. | `alteo-white-fused-alumina`; `wm-fused-mineral-process` |
| boundary_q | complete foreground boundary | Q is net whole grain mass newly passing its first final grade release during the reporting period. Exclude packaging and unreleased/rejected matter, but include the actual accepted grade impurities/minor phases/free moisture; do not use pure Al2O3 fraction. Same-cohort closing finished grain has already entered Q: do not add it as another production output or subtract its manufacturing burdens. Delivery, repeat inspection and returns do not create new Q. | `wm-fused-mineral-process`; `wm-duralum-special-white` |
| boundary_stock | complete foreground boundary | Maintain raw physical and inherited-inventory vectors for opening/closing raw stores, WIP, molten/solidified material awaiting grading, rework and unused/unassigned non-WIP service stores. Internal transfer vectors cancel at consolidation. Manufacturing B_close includes only those unfinished or unused/unassigned stores, never first-released FG. Stock-corrected consumption must not be deducted again. Retain failed lots, Q=0, startup/shutdown, idle and cleanup; no unit result when Q=0. | `jrc-ilcd-attributional-2010` |
| boundary_services | complete foreground boundary | Keep performed packing/storage/handling/dispatch/test/repair services in their original released cohort H with fixed original Q_H and observed horizon. A held FG cohort retains its performed service, even if closing FG remains. Carry only unused/unassigned service or charge forward, without deducting completed service. An optional consolidated report adds manufacturing plus actual service vectors and cancels internal Q once. Net-delivery methods are outside this denominator; any separately developed net-delivery variant requires complete opening/closing FG history, gross G/R, documented original-delivery reversal D_rev and actual incremental work/loss/water attribution. Returned mass is not presumed equal to the original delivery. | `jrc-ilcd-attributional-2010` |
| boundary_packaging | complete foreground boundary | For each packaging material keep opening empty plus WIP/FG-attached plus reusable stock O, external purchased empty P, first non-purchased external ingress I, external return received ER, closing complete stock C, packaging accompanying gross physical shipment S, external return outward EO and waste W: O+P+I+ER+F_in=C+S+EO+W+F_out, including observed attachments and moisture. Internal reuse cancels; no second purchase, net-grain Q or automatic co-product. Preserve I as a real physical ingress and one upstream owner, even when included in supplier price. Repair-part and water X_in/X_out deduplicate only overlapping other incoming/outgoing flow terms, never stocks. New water/material retained in closing stock remains both a real ingress and full closing wet mass; P/I already including it is counted once. Gross legs are never reduced by allocation shares. F_in/F_out are independently measured material/water additions/removals across this packaging-article pool, disjoint from contents already included in the corresponding whole-article legs. Trace origin/destination and component/whole bridges; internal pool/repair transfers cancel once at consolidation without new purchase/provider. X_in/X_out deduct only overlap with another already-counted SAME-SIDE gross inlet/outlet term; closing stock is never such a term. Retained new repair material/water stays in F_in and full closing wet stock; unknown changes/overlap remain unresolved. | `jrc-ilcd-attributional-2010` |
| boundary_assets | complete foreground boundary | Separate whole physical furnace, crusher, screen, filter and test-equipment stocks from current service burdens. Record actual construction/configuration, installed parts/fluids, new and removed parts, lining/electrode wear, repairs and remaining service capacity. Allocate service only through documented actual use and causal capacity; no fixed life or whole furnace per kg grain. A replaceable electrode or lining is a consumable/stock or service as actually operated, never both charged in full and depreciated again. Preserve each new/old material and water phase without removing an ingress because it remains installed. | `jrc-ilcd-attributional-2010` |
| boundary_atomic | complete foreground boundary | Inventory cards are conditional atoms, not a universal recipe. Establish actual presence/absence separately; missing is not zero. Add each real omitted material, supplied chemical formulation, fuel, gas, packaging component, waste and molecular or particulate species as its own card before claiming completeness. A purchased whole formulation is procured once; active ingredient, assay and carrier water are subaccounts, not additional purchases. Actual in-house preparation has separate purchased constituents, energy and losses. No presumed acid washing, steam/boiler, oxygen enrichment or ferrosilicon. | `epa-abrasive-manufacturing-1995`; `wm-fused-mineral-process` |
| boundary_physics | complete foreground boundary | Reconcile manufacturing, FG-service and consolidated gates independently with full wet physical mass and relevant Al/C/H/O/N or other measured elements. Internal gross transfers cancel only once. Distinguish free water, structural/phase water, real reaction water, liquid, vapour and particulate material; no default alumina dehydration or all-carbon-to-CO2 assumption. Measure carbon source and CO/CO2/other carbon fate independently. Keep actual air intake/exhaust species and inert gas/humidity transport; no assumed air fractions. PM/total Al/NOx/COD/VOC are indicators or measured classes, not pure Al2O3, NO/NO2 or a specific compound. Never fit two unknown species or reaction water with one residual. | `epa-abrasive-manufacturing-1995`; `wm-fused-mineral-process` |
| boundary_water_heat | complete foreground boundary | For each real external cooling-water or condensate supply/return specify owner, physical state, temperature/pressure and independently determined enthalpy basis plus supplier water/energy convention. A clean externally returned Product water stream remains physical output without free energy/water credit; polluted effluent and environmental discharge use their actual treatment/media. Mass carriers and heat MJ remain separate linked accounts, not duplicate provider purchase. Recirculation is internal. Do not invent steam or boiler because a furnace cools. | `epa-abrasive-manufacturing-1995`; `wm-fused-mineral-process` |
| packaging_receipt_basis | packaging | For each actual whole packaging article, P records paid procurement (standalone or bundled, with or without a separate invoice). I records first non-purchased external ingress, including standalone gifts, loans, rental/pool issues and unpaid supplier-attached packaging; supplier attachment is only one I subset. ER requires the same item or an auditable matching batch linked to this site's own prior outward record; another party's prior use alone is not a return. P/I/ER are disjoint. The existing matching physical-article cards and raw subledgers cover these origins subject to every native material/form/state qualification; incompatible actual articles require their own atomic rows, never a substitute UUID. F_in/F_out remain separate independently measured actual material/water changes, not a substitute for whole-article receipt. Packaging X_in/X_out are only documented overlap deductions against another already-counted SAME-SIDE gross inlet/outlet term, never stock or actual F. Retain legacy raw X-labelled actual-change records and map each real cross-pool event once to F_in/F_out, not to an overlap deduction; asset/water gate-specific raw names keep their own scope. Current overlap records are separately identified by exact OTHER terms. Proven no same-side duplicate means X deduction zero; unknown overlap remains unresolved. Retained new material/water stays input and full closing wet mass. Keep gross wet quantities, owner/custodian, payment/non-purchase basis, provenance, prior-outward links, actual state/unit and inherited manufacture/service vectors. A free receipt is neither a new manufacture nor automatically burden-free: attribute actual service and incremental transport/handling once to the proper original cohort/denominator and retain genuinely unused service separately, without a default lifetime or credit. Stock, physical gross legs and burden vectors remain separate. This is the declared conserving foreground-accounting implementation, not a claim that the cited source prescribes these variable names. | jrc-ilcd-attributional-2010 |

## 6. Process Inventory Structure

Each card and description applies with the complete conditions in §§5/7/8/9. Amount cards reference the same calc_normalize; complete raw gross physical companion ledgers are never scaled by burden shares. Absence of a conditional atom requires evidence; add every actual extra flow as a card. An unbound UUID does not mean the physical exchange is absent.

###### Whole supplied calcined alumina (`calcined_alumina`)

Whole unfused calcined Bayer alumina feed, with actual impurities, moisture, particle state and supplier evidence. The native at-plant Bayer route is allowed only for compatible calcined feed; its broad corundum/hydrated wording and classification do not authorize natural corundum, hydroxide, bauxite or finished fused grain. Whole kg is purchased once; assay/water are subaccounts.

###### Actual graphite electrode consumption (`graphite_electrode`)

Use only actual graphite electrodes prepared as electrode material and supplied at plant. The native does not prescribe grade, carbon origin, graphite production footprint or wear rate. Separate receipt/installed/remnant stock, consumption and any returned fragments; no full electrode purchase plus duplicate service charge. Determine carbon species/fate independently, not complete stoichiometric CO2.

Conditional single actual fired high-alumina brick article in the furnace installation/repair BOM; native family also mentions silica/magnesia, which are not this selected exchange. Verify actual composition, firing and supplier. No assertion that every furnace uses this lining. Whole wet ingress and installed closing mass remain; only current assigned service/consumption is charged once.

###### Internal cooled fused block (`fused_block`)

Internal solidified/crystallized white fused alumina from calcined alumina electric-arc fusion; native CAS1344-28-1, Product flow, no fixed grade/geography. Distinguish this intermediate from first-released grain; no duplicate Q or external purchase. Track full actual impurity/moisture/temperature state and transfer vector; cancel against the matching grain-stage input. Native generic standards wording is not certification.

###### Actual rejected fusion crust (`fusion_reject`)

Conditional actual distinct waste stream with measured full wet mass, composition, collection point, original cohort and treatment destination. Separate solids and water subaccounts without buying or emitting them twice. Keep all failure/sample/cleanup burdens; outward sale is not an automatic allocation transfer. Reject feed-grade dust, anaerobic sludge, metal smelting slag or part-degreasing-to-water records when route/state/type does not match.

Only actual physical washing/classification/cleanup; no presumed acid preparation. Record actual supplied water identity/owner and each water phase. A CN item-reference process-water record is not kg; an HK volume tap-water record is not a generic supply. Keep unresolved identity with independently measured volume/density or direct water mass.

###### First-released net whole abrasive grain (`finished_grain`)

Whole virgin white fused abrasive grain from calcined alumina electric-arc fusion then actual cooling/crystallization and grade processing; CAS1344-28-1 Product flow. Native has no fixed grade/geography and supports abrasives/refractories; here restrict to non-hollow abrasive grain with actual full minor phases/impurities/free moisture and particle configuration. Not pure assay mass, Bayer feed, natural/sintered/sol-gel corundum, wheel or refractory article. Native classification34220 is inconsistent taxonomy, not evidence against its explicit white-fused physical identity; no accepted classification mapping or standards certification follows. Net first-release Q only; no adding closing FG or counting repeat acceptance.

##### Elementary flows

###### carbon dioxide (fossil) actually emitted (`co2`)

Actual molecular CO2 CAS124-38-9, fossil carbon, emission to air unspecified subcompartment. Native synonyms such as dry ice do not establish emitted phase.

###### Actual whole kraft shipping sack (`paper_sack`)

For this same qualified physical article, apply packaging_receipt_basis to the P/I/ER raw subledgers; standalone non-purchased receipt is I, even when retained unused at closing. Keep this card's original physical-versus-burden role and denominator. Conditional one actual paper sack compatible with the native at-plant paper/kraft bag family, open-mouth or valve configuration. Retain actual virgin/recycled fibre, layers, closure and supplier; no inherited environmental-benefit claim.

###### Actual separate polyethylene bag liner (`pe_film`)

For this same qualified physical article, apply packaging_receipt_basis to the P/I/ER raw subledgers; standalone non-purchased receipt is I, even when retained unused at closing. Keep this card's original physical-versus-burden role and denominator. One declared separate polyethylene-film component per row; CAS9002-88-4, Product flow, at-plant film, no fixed branching grade/geography. Not PET or PP film. If liner and stretch wrap are both supplied, instantiate distinct roles/rows. Included film in a whole purchased bag is a subaccount, not another purchase; all material legs and full attached/wet closing stock remain. Its active source CPC29220 luggage/handbag classification conflicts with the PE-film name, CAS and material description. Source classification clarification is required; retain only actual matching film grade/construction/state and compatible supplier/provider evidence, without a fully verified classification or luggage-article claim.

Keep this card's original physical-versus-burden role and denominator. Conditional whole pallet made of wood boards/slats at lumber mill, native Mass/kg; no standard size, one-pallet mass, life or geography is provided. Keep attached nails/moisture as supplied composition, and separate repairs only when separately supplied. Rental/returnable stock, repairs, external returns and gross shipping legs stay physical; do not buy each internal reuse again. Its active source CPC17100 Electrical energy conflicts with the wooden boards/slats and Product Mass/kg definition; the received wood-packaging classification is preserved history only. Source-owner clarification is required. Retain only the conditional physical whole wooden pallet with actual construction, wet mass and compatible supplier/provider definition; do not infer energy units or fully verified classification/provider applicability.

## 7. Allocation and Co-product Handling

The hierarchy below is restricted to a justified attributional allocation situation; industrial manufacturing pages/PDFs do not establish LCA allocation. All gross physical quantities and performed same-cohort FG services remain; partitioned burdens and physical conservation have separate ledgers.

| rule_id | Applies to | Rule | source_ids |
| --- | --- | --- | --- |
| allocation_hierarchy | shared processes/cohorts/functions | Apply only to an explicitly justified attributional allocation situation. First use dedicated measurements and physical or virtual subdivision for each function/cohort/stage. Then identify exchange-specific determining physical causality, distinguishing embodied material from process-related loss/energy and service intensity. Do not choose physical versus economic allocation freely or apply one mass share to every exchange. | `jrc-ilcd-attributional-2010` |
| allocation_residual | shared processes/cohorts/functions | Only for the genuinely remaining inseparable common-process inventory use contemporaneous quantity times representative market value at the actual common exit condition/gate. Remove subsequent packaging/transport/conditioning from downstream prices; document currency/period, quality, quantity, market basis and uncertainty. Unknown values remain unresolved; no fixed ratio. Hold only the residual allocation for review if any required quantity or common-gate value is missing or nonpositive, the co-function set or common gate/state is undefined, credits/offsets are not separated, or the value-weight denominator is nonpositive, nonfinite or undefined. Do not create negative allocation shares or credits, take absolute values, clamp to zero or insert defaults. Retain raw physical quantities and justified dedicated/causal assignments. This hold requires review of function, gate and value basis; it does not exclude a grade or route because of its buyer price. Sum allocated inventories over all functions equals the original inventory. Physical gross outputs, stock and packaging legs remain unscaled. | `jrc-ilcd-attributional-2010` |
| allocation_failure | shared processes/cohorts/functions | Ordinary manufacturing failures, dust, rejected grain, samples, broken material and their treatment remain burdens of manufacture, including external sale or collection. No automatic T_other subtraction, avoided-product credit, free recycled feed or credit from an outward water/packaging leg. A transfer is allowed once only for a real independent other cohort/function plus justified allocation or burden-handover decision, with inherited vector and receiving account. Reuse/recycling requires the actual quality/state and consistent true-joint-process/treatment boundary; this PCR supplies no universal recycling factor. | `jrc-ilcd-attributional-2010` |
| allocation_rework | shared processes/cohorts/functions | Actual pre-release rework is internal with its inherited burden and new increments. Post-release regrading/reprocessing belongs to the original cohort service and requires manufacturer/specification permission, postwork tests, acceptance and disposition. A rejected grade is not assumed recoverable merely because it can be crushed again. A sold independent grade requires actual specifications, function, quality release and the allocation hierarchy; do not auto-promote fines or magnetic reject into co-products. | `jrc-ilcd-attributional-2010` |

## 8. Foreground Data Collection, Calculation, and Quality Rules

Protocols collect only unnormalized raw data and inherited vectors. “per reference flow” in aggregation_rule names the same output basis of calc_normalize; it performs no second division in the protocol. Manufacture uses Q and actual original-cohort service its original Q_H. Records cover the complete reporting period and observed service horizon including failures/Q0, start/stop, idle, cleanup, stores and every actual destination.

Retain older raw X-labelled actual-change fields with their original provenance; record their role and bridge each actual material/water event once to F_in/F_out, never adding the alias again or treating it as a deduction. Separately record packaging overlap deductions as X_overlap_in/X_overlap_out, mapped to reconciliation X_in/X_out only with exact already-counted SAME-SIDE OTHER flow evidence.

### Calculation Rules

| rule_id | Applies to | Formula or rule | Inputs | Output | source_ids |
| --- | --- | --- | --- | --- | --- |
| calc_raw | raw meters and quantities | Convert raw observations to each exchange native extensive unit before allocation. Cumulative volume is already integrated; only real rates use sum(rate×interval). For electricity use1kWh=3.6MJ. For other substances use independently measured density at the stated condition, never a secondary flow-property factor or water density by analogy. | raw measurements; explicit units; actual state; independent density | converted raw extensive observations |  |
| calc_q | finished_grain | Q = sum(unique newly first-released target-grade net whole kg). Keep gross release/hold/reject/rework records; actual impurities/free water remain. Closing FG is a partition of Q, not another output or manufacturing stock deduction. Q=0 retains burden and returns no unit value. | cp_release | Q | `wm-fused-mineral-process` |
| calc_manufacturing | manufacturing inventory vectors | A = B_open + V_new - B_close - T_other. Each term is a same-unit exchange vector after raw conversion and real allocation. B_open/B_close cover raw/WIP/unused-unassigned non-WIP stores only; no first-released FG. V_new includes actual failures/Q0/startstop/idle/cleanup and increments. T_other requires a real independent function/cohort and justified one-time allocation/handover; ordinary waste or sale is insufficient. Cancel internal transfers once and do not repeat stock-corrected consumption. While allocation_residual is held, retain the unallocated residual alongside V_new, inherited stores and completed dedicated/causal assignments; no complete allocated A or normalized result is available. The hold never erases physical flows, failures or performed original-cohort services. | converted raw vectors; inherited store vectors; allocation decisions | A | `jrc-ilcd-attributional-2010` |
| calc_service | original cohort H | A_H = performed service vector assigned to original cohort H over the observed horizon. Keep its fixed original Q_H, full FG history, real losses and new permitted postwork. Deduct only unused/unassigned service already carried as such, once; never deduct performed service because FG remains held. No manufacture reversal or net-delivery denominator is inferred. | cp_service; cp_pack; actual utility/asset increments | A_H; Q_H | `jrc-ilcd-attributional-2010` |
| calc_normalize | all inventory rows except fixed finished_grain | For manufacture q_i = A_i / Q; for actual original-cohort service q_i,H = A_i,H / Q_H. Apply this division exactly once after raw conversion, stock/inheritance and real allocation. Amount cards and protocol aggregation labels reference this same calculation, never another division. Consolidated reporting sums compatible manufacturing/service vectors and cancels internal first-release Q once. Keep gross physical companion ledgers unscaled by burden shares. If the relevant Q or Q_H is zero retain raw vector and emit no unit result. | A; Q; A_H; Q_H | q_i; q_i,H |  |
| calc_physical | all physical gates and packaging | For each physical material/species: opening + external incoming = closing + external outgoing, with independently evidenced reaction/phase transformations stated explicitly. Do not add total wet waste and its water/solid subaccounts twice. For each packaging material O+P+I+ER+F_in=C+S+EO+W+F_out. X_in/out removes only duplicate other flow terms, never retained new influx or full closing wet stock. Gross physical legs are not burden vectors and are not scaled by economic allocation. One residual cannot determine multiple unknowns. F_in/F_out are independently measured material/water additions/removals across this packaging-article pool, disjoint from contents already included in the corresponding whole-article legs. Trace origin/destination and component/whole bridges; internal pool/repair transfers cancel once at consolidation without new purchase/provider. X_in/X_out deduct only overlap with another already-counted SAME-SIDE gross inlet/outlet term; closing stock is never such a term. Retained new repair material/water stays in F_in and full closing wet stock; unknown changes/overlap remain unresolved. | cp_material; cp_water; cp_asset; cp_pack; cp_emission | physical closure and unresolved residuals |  |

### Data Quality Requirements

| requirement_id | Applies to | Requirement | Evidence |
| --- | --- | --- | --- |
| dq_identity | each product and exchange | Verify actual whole product, route, phase, grade, CAS where applicable, geography/media/type and every native property/reference-unit restriction. UUID identity is not a provider dataset or grade approval; unresolved auxiliaries need completion before actual dataset use. | direct native record; actual supply and process evidence |
| dq_representative | whole reporting period | Cover all operating modes, failed/Q0 runs, raw/WIP stocks and cohort history; disclose sampling, temporal/geographic representativeness, detection limits, uncertainty and actual gaps. Future factory values are requirements, not observations. | complete time records; stock counts; original cohort release history |
| dq_source | each constraint and amount | Keep independent primary route support, actual foreground records and LCA allocation sources in their own roles. Retain adjacent counterexamples and full supplier formulation context. No primary numeric recipes, SDS density/purity or EPA grit-dryer factor is a universal value. | full cited source; scope comparison; actual raw records |
| dq_allocation | each shared burden and exit | Retain subdivision attempts, determining causality per exchange, residual same-gate/state prices, conservation across all functions and uncertainty. Unresolved core route/terminal identity cannot be replaced by a mechanically passing check. | metering; technical relationship; market evidence;100% check |
| dq_bilingual | whole method | Keep English and Chinese quantities, qualifier elements, atomic rows, source IDs, rules and stage conditions aligned; retain actual missing evidence without scientific/translation approval claims. | paired source/structured field audit |

## 9. Validation Rules

Apply these rules with the complete premises in §§5/7 and raw quantities, formulas and quality requirements in §8. Unresolved/unmeasured items cannot masquerade as passes; these are not claims that future factory tests have already occurred.

| rule_id | Applies to | Rule | source_ids |
| --- | --- | --- | --- |
| validate_terminal | complete data package and raw context | Require the declared whole virgin white electric-fused abrasive grain and actual full manufacture/grade-release evidence. A hard native material/CAS/route/phase/type conflict or unresolved core terminal identity makes the concrete dataset unusable; do not use raw Bayer alumina, natural/sintered grains, gem sapphire, whole wheels or a formal checker to fill that gap. | `wm-fused-mineral-process`; `jrc-ilcd-attributional-2010` |
| validate_measurement | complete data package and raw context | Check unique finished_grain output,1kg reference, Q/Q_H lineage, all original units and conversion before the single calc_normalize. No missing/unknown conversion may be called pass. Q0 produces no unit result; first-release closing FG is not an extra production output or manufacturing B_close. | `wm-fused-mineral-process`; `jrc-ilcd-attributional-2010` |
| validate_closure | complete data package and raw context | Require independent wet physical mass and relevant element/species checks at manufacturing/service/consolidated gates, full packaging O/P/I/ER/F_in/C/S/EO/W/F_out closure and documented SAME-SIDE OTHER X overlap evidence. Retained new influx plus full closing wet stock stay. No gross legs reduced by burden shares, single residual for multiple unknowns, total/subset double count or waste-sale automatic T_other. | `wm-fused-mineral-process`; `jrc-ilcd-attributional-2010` |
| validate_completeness | complete data package and raw context | Account for all actual consumables, asset service, utilities, controls, ordinary losses and treatment, emissions and post-release increments. Missing records are unresolved, not confirmed zero; each additional actual atom needs a card and its own property/media/source support. Actual FG postwork requires manufacturer/spec permission, posttests, acceptance and disposition. An allocation_residual hold prevents a complete allocated result: disclose retained raw, dedicated/causal and unresolved residual vectors, and resolve the function/gate/value/denominator evidence before closing the hold. | `wm-fused-mineral-process`; `jrc-ilcd-attributional-2010` |
| validate_approval | complete data package and raw context | Report which checks were performed, skipped or unresolved and their evidence. Arithmetic/schema/source-fidelity checks do not establish scientific review, translation review, accepted mapping, certification or publication. |  |

## 10. Published Dataset Profile

| Field | Value |
| --- | --- |
| dataset_role | secondary_dataset; background_dataset |
| downstream_use | Use completed manufacture data plus explicit service accounts after actual evidence/applicability review for matching grade/gate/reference basis |
| allowed_use | Attributional inventory of whole virgin white fused abrasive grain; actual original-cohort services disclosed separately |

| required_quality_disclosure | Complete actual scope/units/stocks/services/allocation/upstream ownership; performed/unresolved checks; representativeness and uncertainty; no scientific/translation/mapping/publication approval from this template |
| update_trigger | Material change in feed/fusion route, grade/phase/size, first-release gate, assets/utilities/water-energy conventions, supplier, allocation or measurement |
