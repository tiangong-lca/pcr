# Uncoated turned single-piece solid-beech furniture leg manufacture

## 1. Scope and Applicability

This attributional method covers actual receipt of kiln-dried beech sawn stock/squares through cutting blanks, turning, real connection-hole/fit machining, dry sanding and actual specified connector installation, then inspection to the approved drawing and unique first quality release of each complete furniture leg. The terminal is an independently supplied furniture component deliberately uncoated but fully shaped and surface-prepared for its declared connection interface, with downstream finishing/furniture assembly outside this terminal. It is not a rough blank, bundle of round rods or complete furniture. `richman-unfinished-leg` establishes individually sold unfinished surface-prepared solid turned legs and an inserted-connector example; `drewbak-components` establishes industrial beech component machining and drawing/finished-component quality context; `bukexpo-beech-supply` supplies independent sawing/kiln-drying/stock-form context. This is transparent technical synthesis, not a shared SKU, current common order, factory recipe or proven supplier chain.

Exclude tool handles/ornaments, raw sawnwood/unshaped billets, laminated/finger-jointed/glued or bentwood, heat-densified/preserved stock, coated/oiled/waxed legs, onsite log conversion/kiln drying/glue or coating mixing, whole chairs/tables/cabinets, complete flat-pack kits and installed furniture. Actual coating or bonding is not a hidden zero operation: first extend evidence, materials, energy, reactions/emissions and finished acceptance boundary. Surface preparation in this bounded route is actual dry sanding; no glue or coating is invented. Supplier forestry, sawing, drying and article manufacturing burdens remain upstream in the product system.

This is a declared production quantity, with no mass-equivalent function, furniture lifetime, load/strength threshold, dimension, moisture target, density, speed, temperature/time, dosage, yield or certification default. Actual packaging/storage/handling/dispatch/returns have a separate service account for observed H and original cohort Q_H. Engineering consistency is not scientific/translation approval, mapping or publication.

| Required qualifiers | Approved complete-leg drawing and revision; Fagus botanical species and legal origin; Single-piece unglued untreated solid construction; Kiln-dried sawn-stock supply gate and upstream ownership; Actual whole-part geometry and connection fit; Uncoated sanded market state; Actual mounting connector BOM and installation owner; Actual machining and sanding sequence; Moisture basis and independent sampling; Measured net complete-leg mass and calibration; Unique first-release cohort and Q; Actual dimensional/interface/surface acceptance and disposition; Raw and WIP opening/closing inherited vectors; Released FG and original-cohort service horizon H and Q_H; Failures samples zero-output idle cleanup and actual rework; Every packaging article and six actual directions; Whole supplies and disjoint constituent ownership; Asset receipt installed stock remaining service and retirement; Ordinary humidity exchange and each real water phase; Atomic air species and actual destination; Biogenic fossil and ambient carbon separation; Site period supply voltage geography and providers; All unresolved identities and uncertainty |

Declare every qualifier in dataset metadata, notes or equivalent consumable fields. Native Mass/kg determines the denominator. Count-based collection requires calibrated net complete-leg weighing for the same configuration/moisture scope, individually or with a justified representative measured sampling record, before summing first-release kg. Item(s) and item are equivalent count units with factor1 and supply no kg. Do not guess kg/leg from catalog mass, secondary Mass coefficient, bounding area or density. This method does not use area Q. Complete native terminal restrictions are also retained in finished_leg for contextual consumption.

## 4. Measurement and Unit Rules

| rule_id | Applies to | Required property | Required unit | Rule |
| --- | --- | --- | --- | --- |
| reference_mass | reference product | Mass `93a60a56-a3c8-11da-a746-0800200b9a66` | kg | Q is the sum of uniquely first-released net complete-leg kg, including released closing FG, excluding packaging; use cp_release. FG is not another output or a deduction from manufacturing burden. |
| extensive_units | all inventory rows | Native extensive property of each individual exchange | kg; MJ; m3; kg*km; h | Preserve the real extensive quantity per row. Mass rules do not force electrical MJ, gas m3, freight kg*km or actual capacity h into kg. Raw-unit conversion precedes attribution and the sole quotient. |
| wood_moisture | beech_stock; finished_leg; wood residues | Mass | kg | Collect full wet wood, independent oven-dry wood and moisture basis separately; u=(wet-dry)/dry applies only to isolated wood with steel/abrasive attachment bridges. Include actual natural moisture uptake/loss. |
| gross_leg | each gross card | Native extensive property of that actual leg | kg; m3 | Every gross-card numerator is complete V, never B_open+U-B_close or an economic/service share; assign the separate burden once while retaining native units. |

## 5. System Boundary

### Boundary Abstraction

| Field | Value |
| --- | --- |
| declared_starting_condition | Received untreated unglued kiln-dried Fagus sawn stock >6 mm and actual separately supplied connector/consumables; no purchased preturned leg substitution |
| starting_condition_role | secondary_manufacturing |
| product_classification_scope | A narrow manufactured wooden-furniture-part subset; no positive mapping inferred |
| recursive_input_rule | Purchased whole finished legs retain their existing burdens and first-release identity; cannot substitute for this manufacturing route or create new Q by repacking; internal equal-product transfers cancel |
| upstream_dataset_requirement | Match actual forestry, sawing, kiln drying, stock form/moisture/species/origin and supplier gate; input article manufacture and transport/packaging each have one owner; no zero upstream burden |
| disclosure | Actual onsite/upstream split; full gross custody and raw/WIP/FG stocks; inherited vectors; real service H/Q_H; all real atoms and unresolved identities/providers |

| rule_id | Applies to | Rule | source_ids |
| --- | --- | --- | --- |
| boundary_route | complete product system | Include full stock-to-leg machining, dust control, actual connectors, inspection and pre-release rework; startup/shutdown, idle, cleanup, failed/zero-output runs and samples retain real loads. Purchased stock drying remains upstream. Add each real unlisted chemical, fuel, water supply, component, emission and outlet before use; no hidden other/zero bundle. This dry electric route does not invent a boiler, steam, combustion or surface coating. | `richman-unfinished-leg`; `drewbak-components`; `bukexpo-beech-supply` |
| boundary_first_release | manufacturing and gate_service | Q is net mass newly first quality-released once. Closing already-released FG is included in Q, never deducted from manufacturing B_close or added as a second product. Manufacturing B_close includes only raw/WIP and unused unassigned material/service charges. Packaging/storage/handling/dispatch/returns have original cohort Q_H and observed horizon H; consolidate internal Q handover by cancellation. | `ilcd-attributional-2010` |
| boundary_postrelease | actual FG work and natural moisture | Post-release machining/repair requires manufacturer/specification permission, postwork tests, acceptance and disposition to claim continuing qualification; it creates no first release. Lack of permission or failed tests never deletes an actual operation, physical flow or load: retain original cohort and hold/waste status. Broken parts are not assumed restorable. Ordinary humidity uptake/loss is measured independently and needs no invented work permission. | `richman-unfinished-leg`; `usda-wood-handbook-2021` |
| boundary_gross | each physical gate | Reconcile manufacturing, FG service and consolidated gates with full opening/closing wet raw/WIP/FG, equipment, installed fluids and all actual external gross legs. Never scale physical mass by economic/burden shares. F_in/F_out are independently measured real repair/new-material/water-phase influx and outflow, never a balance residual. X_in/X_out deduct only a proven duplicate already included in an OTHER actual same-side inlet/outlet term, with matched event identity. Stock, an opposite-side term, merely having a card, or closing retention is not overlap evidence. Preserve true retained influx and full wet closing stock simultaneously. Whole articles/preparations and disjoint constituent bridges occur once; internal handovers cancel. | `ilcd-attributional-2010`; `usda-wood-handbook-2021` |
| boundary_ownership | whole supply and actual disposal | One whole externally purchased preparation/article is procured once; assay, carried water, binder, active components, embedded studs and initial installed fluids are subledgers. Real onsite manufacture/mixing has each separately bought input, real energy and losses. Real waste/failure/sample exports or sales do not by themselves transfer manufacturing or treatment burdens. No automatic coproduct, avoided production or negative credit. | `ilcd-attributional-2010` |
| packaging_receipt_basis | packaging | For each actual whole packaging article, P records paid procurement (standalone or bundled, with or without a separate invoice). I records first non-purchased external ingress, including standalone gifts, loans, rental/pool issues and unpaid supplier-attached packaging; supplier attachment is only one I subset. ER requires the same item or an auditable matching batch linked to this site's own prior outward record; another party's prior use alone is not a return. P/I/ER are disjoint. The existing matching physical-article cards and raw subledgers cover these origins subject to every native material/form/state qualification; incompatible actual articles require their own atomic rows, never a substitute UUID. F_in/F_out retain independently measured material/water changes. X_in/X_out remove only a documented duplicate already present in another real same-side flow, never stock, the opposite side, card presence or closing retention; neither F nor X is a residual used to force closure. For a receipt whose history or paid/non-purchased status cannot establish P/I/ER, retain one provisional atomic whole-article F_in under cp_packaging, mutually exclusive with P/I/ER and other F components, until evidence establishes its unique final category. Proven first non-purchased/replacement articles use I, not an additional final whole-article F_in. Reclassification moves the one measured event and its burden handover, without adding a second inlet/provider or cancelling it against full wet closing stock. Keep gross wet quantities, owner/custodian, payment/non-purchase basis, provenance, prior-outward links, actual state/unit and inherited manufacture/service vectors. A free receipt is neither a new manufacture nor automatically burden-free: attribute actual service and incremental transport/handling once to the proper original cohort/denominator and retain genuinely unused service separately, without a default lifetime or credit. Stock, physical gross legs and burden vectors remain separate. This is the declared conserving foreground-accounting implementation, not a claim that the cited source prescribes these variable names. | ilcd-attributional-2010 |

## 6. Process Inventory Structure

Every card retains its complete description and ancestor scope. Add any real missing atomic exchange before use. Absence of a conditional exchange needs evidence; a missing UUID is not zero. Gross physical cards fix A to complete V; the burden/service vector is independently assigned once.

### Process Map

#### Inputs

##### Product flows

###### Kiln-dried beech sawn stock (`beech_stock`)

Weigh full received wet stock; cutting blanks onsite is foreground manufacture, not another purchased finished leg. Supplier drying is upstream. Native Product is kiln-dried hardwood sawnwood, generic unspecified species at sawmill, Mass/kg, with synonyms for KD hardwood lumber. Its comment mentions seat-frame feedstock, not a separate physical grade or an exclusive final use. Restrict the real supply here to untreated unglued Fagus solid sawn stock thicker than 6 mm, with actual botanical species/origin/moisture and receiving state; no laminated, finger-jointed, green or preturned leg substitution. Upstream forestry/sawmill/kiln and supply transport remain owned once.

###### Steel mounting hanger stud (`mounting_stud`)

Conditional on an actually separately purchased and onsite installed screw-form steel connector. An insert already embodied in a supplied component is not purchased again. Keep actual holes/thread and assembly tests; source M8 wording is an example, not a PCR dimension. Native Product is a steel screw, Mass/kg, no fixed grade, surface treatment, thread or geography; historical other-goods classification is preserved separately. Restrict to one actually purchased steel screw-form hanger stud compatible with the approved leg interface and supplier BOM. The primary product proves an inserted connector but not its alloy. Establish steel and actual coating/geometry independently; a brass insert, nut, threaded sleeve or separately supplied kit is not this flow.

###### Whole paper-backed sanding abrasive (`abrasive_paper`)

Actual supplied consumable for the approved dry sanding sequence. Record fresh/unused closing material separately from spent material; do not buy binder/grains again. Native Product is abrasive paper at plant, Mass/kg, no fixed grit, binder, geography or treatment route. The preserved legacy source classification says other goods; the active abrasive classification and paper article are coherent and supply no recipe. Restrict to one whole paper-backed abrasive sheet/belt actually used for dry wood sanding, including backing, binder and grains once; cloth abrasives or loose abrasive grains need their own rows.

- Selected flow: Abrasive paper `ba6c99d4-60d9-46a5-9ef5-ca3d0b877d57`

###### Manufacturing electricity (`electricity_m`)

Meter sawing, turning, drilling, sanding, dust extraction and actual onsite compressed-air auxiliaries separately where possible, including failed/idle/start-stop/cleanup work. Avoid duplicate compressor energy inside a purchased-air provider. Native Product is alternating current below 1 kV, consumption mix to user, grid-average supply, CN, with native energy property/MJ. It is usable only for actual matching Chinese low-voltage grid supply. Another geography, voltage, generator or contractual supply needs another verified identity/provider; this record is not a worldwide electricity default. Convert raw cumulative kWh by 3.6 MJ/kWh once; do not interpret the property name as fuel combustion.

- Collection protocol: `cp_energy_m`
- Sources: `drewbak-components`; `ilcd-attributional-2010`

###### Manufacturing cleaning tap water (`tap_water_m`)

Conditional real wet cleaning or maintenance supply; dry machining does not imply automatic water use. Keep full actual influx even when it stays in closing wet stock/fluid. New or reclaimed different supplies are separate real flows. Native Product is tap water, Mass/kg, without fixed treatment, geography or composition; historical other-goods classification is retained but active natural-water identity is coherent. Restrict to actual externally supplied tap water; independently record quality, temperature, source/provider and meter basis. It is not deionised water, boiler steam, wastewater or atmospheric sorption. Any changed water supply or actual separately returned condensate needs its own verified atomic flow and heat-state record.

- Selected flow: Water, tap `c6fb2442-d527-4e3d-bf01-4c94ea2b71ec`
- Flow property / unit: Mass `93a60a56-a3c8-11da-a746-0800200b9a66` / kg

- Evidence kind: `calculated_from_collection`
- Collection protocol: `cp_water_m`
- Sources: `drewbak-components`; `ilcd-attributional-2010`

###### External compressed-air supply (`compressed_air`)

Conditional external supply only. Its energy burden is separate from physical carrier mass; trace whole-air/species bridge without procurement duplication. Native Product is compressed air at pressure greater than atmosphere, Volume/m3, no fixed pressure, temperature, dryness, route or geography. Adopt only one real external compressed-air supply whose metered reference conditions and supplier burden match. Normalize actual/standard volume explicitly; do not multiply cumulative volume by time or use liquid-water density. Onsite compression is internal and its electricity/condensate/leaks are collected once, without a second purchased-air provider. Whole supplied air and its species remain disjoint at the external gate.

Retain complete external supplied V in native Volume/m3 at its documented delivered reference state separately from attributed burden A. Any standard-volume or mass bridge requires an explicit conversion and independently established actual-state whole-air density and measured nonadditive composition; no default gas fractions or Normal Volume property substitution. Supplied whole-air constituents are composition subaccounts; only real external atmospheric ingress uses Resource identities.

- Selected flow: Compressed air `46e2b1e4-5a4e-4579-b6a2-65b03f9ce825`
- Flow property / unit: Volume `93a60a56-a3c8-22da-a746-0800200c9a66` / m3

###### Whole petroleum lubricating oil (`lubricant`)

Conditional actual mineral-oil machinery lubrication, full purchased preparation once. Supplier-approved composition/grade and viscosity, fossil carbon, charge/refill/drain, installed/open/closing stock and losses require records. The queried PAO/fully synthetic and fixed-calorific alternatives are not substituted. Keep additions as real influx even when still installed at closing.

- Sources: `drewbak-components`; `ilcd-attributional-2010`

###### New carbide turning insert (`cutting_insert_new`)

Conditional one actually externally received new carbide insert of approved composition/geometry for wood. The queried generic tool-wear record is a consumed-wear estimate and is not adopted as a whole received tool. Record full new mass plus closing installed/storage mass; service burden is independently assigned, not one insert per kg leg.

- Selected flow: Carbide woodturning insert
- Flow property / unit: Mass / kg
- Amount rule: A / Q; A = V is the complete actual gross event independent of burden, stock and economic shares; use the sole quotient in section 8.

###### Used carbide insert received for reuse (`cutting_insert_old_in`)

Conditional real external old tool receipt, not an internal reinstall. Record previous owner/burden handover and condition, whole mass and service eligibility. Do not duplicate the new-tool receipt or assume free impact.

- Selected flow: Used carbide woodturning insert
- Flow property / unit: Mass / kg
- Amount rule: A / Q; A = V is the complete actual gross event independent of burden, stock and economic shares; use the sole quotient in section 8.

###### New woodturning lathe received (`lathe_new`)

Conditional actual new physical woodworking lathe entering the asset gate. Record whole machine mass, installed fluids once and disjoint component BOM. Native metal-cutting lathe query members are not compatible. Full purchase mass is a custody leg; its embodied vector enters the independent service register, not every kg of furniture leg.

- Selected flow: Woodturning lathe

- Sources: `drewbak-components`; `ilcd-attributional-2010`

###### Used woodturning lathe received (`lathe_old_in`)

Conditional external used machine, with previous service/remaining burden and actual condition, not an internal asset move. Existing-machine service remains in scope even when no new machine is purchased during the period.

- Selected flow: Used woodturning lathe
- Flow property / unit: Mass / kg
- Amount rule: A / Q; A = V is the complete actual gross event independent of burden, stock and economic shares; use the sole quotient in section 8.

###### Woodturning lathe capacity service (`lathe_service`)

Represent actual occupied capacity hours with independent embodied manufacture/maintenance service vector from cp_asset_m. Include setup, failures, idle required for the cohort and approved actual service weighting; no fixed life, default machine mass or kg-per-part coefficient. Exclude electricity/repair materials already explicit elsewhere; preserve the exact service boundary/provider to avoid summing a full leased-service bundle again.

- Selected flow: Woodturning lathe capacity service
- Flow property / unit: Duration / h
- Amount rule: A / Q; A is the actual woodturning capacity service attributed once to this manufacturing cohort, in h; Q is its unique manufacturing first-release kg. H records observation only; use the sole quotient in section 8.

###### Purchased inbound road freight (`inbound_freight`)

Conditional actual road movement of sawn stock, connectors and supplies; separate any materially different real leg/provider. No second freight where incoming provider already includes it. Native Product is road freight service, production mix at plant, native mass*distance in kg*km; no fixed truck, fuel, load, route or geography. Keep each actual leg, gross transported wet cargo including packaging, distance, load/empty return and provider boundary; supplier-included freight is not procured twice. Convert t*km to kg*km by 1000 only when truly recorded on that basis; no default distance or load.

##### Waste flows

##### Elementary flows

###### Nitrogen in actual air intake (`n2_m_in`)

Individual ordinary gaseous Nitrogen, CAS 7727-37-9, in real air intake/exhaust. Measure full gross mass independently of burden shares, actual destination and state; air circulation alone is not chemical production or a purchased pure gas. Whole externally supplied compressed-air mass and the species analysis are a disjoint bridge: do not add component masses to their already counted incoming whole article. No default air composition, reaction, disappearance or zero.

Native Elementary identity is ordinary gaseous molecular N2 (CAS 7727-37-9), a renewable element Resource from air for actual external atmospheric ingress, with sole Mass/kg reference. Preserve the actual compartment and direction: this is not purchased separated gas or a second free Resource input for constituents already inside supplied compressed air. The alias list does not authorize liquid phase, enriched isotope, radioactive gas, an ion or another molecule. Measure actual gross mass; chemical identity alone does not establish net creation, consumption or environmental change.

###### Argon in actual air intake (`ar_m_in`)

Individual ordinary gaseous Argon, CAS 7440-37-1, in real air intake/exhaust.

###### Ordinary water vapour leaving (`water_vapour_m`)

Include independently observed moisture loss from normal processing/storage/handling as well as actual cleaning/repair. A permitted operation is not required for natural loss; any actual unauthorised/failed work still retains full loads and hold/waste disposition. Native Elementary is ordinary water vapour, CAS 7732-18-5, emissions to air unspecified, Mass/kg, no fixed geography. The synonym list contains liquid water, ice, bound water and heavy/tritiated/isotopic labels; these are not adopted as the actual gas. Use independently measured ordinary H2O vapour at this destination only. This is outgoing water from ordinary processing/storage/handling as well as cleaning; it does not prove a reaction or default evaporation. Known other compartments need newly matched identities.

Actual uncaptured single dust stream from dry cutting/turning/sanding, its solid particle composition and size distribution measured. Captured residue is not an air emission. PM10 includes PM2.5; do not sum nested bins, call PM10 greater-than-10, assign a molecule or use a mismatched long-term/urban/high-stack native.

#### Inputs

##### Product flows

###### Complete-leg external return (`fg_return`)

Actual external return of one originally manufactured whole uncoated beech furniture leg; retain original release/cohort/BOM, actual current condition and hold/testing/disposition. Native manufactured wooden-furniture-part Product, plant production mix, Mass/kg, no fixed geography/size/species, does not imply renewed acceptance or restored damage. Do not require a positive postwork outcome to record an actual return; failed/unauthorised work and its loads remain. This gross receipt is not a purchase of a new leg or new Q. Fragments/waste returns are separately identified in their real state and cannot use this complete-article identity.

###### Corrugated shipping carton (`carton_p`)

One actual complete corrugated-paperboard transport carton of the declared construction and configuration, not a collection of cartons, plastic bags, film, liners or other packaging. The compatible atomic Product-flow UUID remains unresolved. Record the actual board/flute/ply configuration, fibre composition, coatings/lamination, wet condition, integral adhesives/fasteners and supplier scope; no generic fibre fraction, treatment, size, weight or lifetime is assumed. Include integral supplied constituents once within the whole carton, while actually separate inserts, tape or other materials retain their own disjoint rows and one upstream owner. Keep this card's existing P/I/ER/S/EO role as defined by the packaging boundary and raw protocol, including packaging_receipt_basis where present; a new provider identity must not change that event definition. Retain the complete measured wet gross quantity and the original event/gate/custody/cohort in the card's stated Mass/kg unit, whether immediately used or retained at closing. Keep opening/closing empty, attached and reusable stock, internal reuse and independently measured material/water-change legs; no stock, burden or economic-share correction shrinks the gross leg. Actual manufacture/service burdens are attributed once separately using the existing original-cohort rule and sole normalization; a gross receipt or outflow alone creates no new manufacture, procurement burden, provider link or credit. Resolve a physically compatible carton identity/provider before binding it; missing identity is disclosed and never replaced with a mixed packaging category or an invented UUID.

###### Corrugated shipping carton (`carton_er`)

One actual complete corrugated-paperboard transport carton of the declared construction and configuration, not a collection of cartons, plastic bags, film, liners or other packaging. The compatible atomic Product-flow UUID remains unresolved. Record the actual board/flute/ply configuration, fibre composition, coatings/lamination, wet condition, integral adhesives/fasteners and supplier scope; no generic fibre fraction, treatment, size, weight or lifetime is assumed. Include integral supplied constituents once within the whole carton, while actually separate inserts, tape or other materials retain their own disjoint rows and one upstream owner. Keep this card's existing P/I/ER/S/EO role as defined by the packaging boundary and raw protocol, including packaging_receipt_basis where present; a new provider identity must not change that event definition. Retain the complete measured wet gross quantity and the original event/gate/custody/cohort in the card's stated Mass/kg unit, whether immediately used or retained at closing. Keep opening/closing empty, attached and reusable stock, internal reuse and independently measured material/water-change legs; no stock, burden or economic-share correction shrinks the gross leg. Actual manufacture/service burdens are attributed once separately using the existing original-cohort rule and sole normalization; a gross receipt or outflow alone creates no new manufacture, procurement burden, provider link or credit. Resolve a physically compatible carton identity/provider before binding it; missing identity is disclosed and never replaced with a mixed packaging category or an invented UUID. ER requires the same physical article, or an auditable batch with traceable membership and movement history, to have actually left this boundary previously as S or EO for the original cohort. Link its article/batch identity and cohort, prior outward event/date and return receipt; retain earlier-period/offsite custody history when needed. Same material, UUID, equal mass, previous use or burden handover alone does not prove a return. Independently measure actual returned wet mass and condition; do not assume equality with the earlier outward mass. First external non-purchased or replacement articles without that same-article prior outward are not ER: proven first non-purchased ingress is I under packaging_receipt_basis, with one atomic receipt and the complete cp_packaging Amount/collection chain. If history or paid/non-purchased status cannot establish P/I/ER, retain the full measured inlet as one provisional atomic whole-article F_in event with classification unresolved, never invent prior outward, a purchase or omit the receipt; resolve its single final category before dataset acceptance.

###### New purchase — LDPE wrapping film (`film_p`)

This P card records paid procurement of this same qualified article, standalone or bundled; non-purchased first ingress and true returns use I and ER. Physical leg P for this one material pool, conditional on its actual occurrence. New whole purchased article only; its upstream owner is recorded once. Numerator is the complete actual gross-leg V in its native unit, never a manufacturing/service burden vector, stock-corrected consumption or economic share. No extra purchase, supplier burden or credit arises from gross disclosure. Opening/closing wet empty/attached-WIP/attached-FG/reusable stocks remain complete; P/I partition the same received article by ownership and are mutually exclusive; internal reuse cancels. Native Product is low-density polyethylene foil (PE-LD), Mass/kg, with non-self-adhesive non-cellular non-reinforced non-laminated unsupported film classification and no fixed geography/route. Only one compatible actual LDPE film article qualifies; not PET, woven PP, multilayer film, a bag plus its film twice, or a paper carton. Declare additives, article manufacture and supplier once.

###### External return received — LDPE wrapping film (`film_er`)

Physical leg ER for this one material pool, conditional on its actual occurrence. ER requires the same physical article, or an auditable batch with traceable membership and movement history, to have actually left this boundary previously as S or EO for the original cohort. Link its article/batch identity and cohort, prior outward event/date and return receipt; retain earlier-period/offsite custody history when needed. Same material, UUID, equal mass, previous use or burden handover alone does not prove a return. Independently measure actual returned wet mass and condition; do not assume equality with the earlier outward mass.

###### Factory-gate service electricity (`electricity_h`)

Only actual incremental packaging, handling and storage electricity during observed horizon H, linked to original released cohort Q_H including closing FG. Performed service is never removed merely because FG is held at closing. Avoid duplication of manufacturing electricity. Native Product is alternating current below 1 kV, consumption mix to user, grid-average supply, CN, with native energy property/MJ. It is usable only for actual matching Chinese low-voltage grid supply. Another geography, voltage, generator or contractual supply needs another verified identity/provider; this record is not a worldwide electricity default. Convert raw cumulative kWh by 3.6 MJ/kWh once; do not interpret the property name as fuel combustion.

###### Factory-gate cleaning tap water (`tap_water_h`)

Conditional actual cleaning/repair water in H. Record full inlet and wet closing stock, disjoint from water already inside received articles or another inlet. It does not exhaust natural humidity exchange, which has its own cards. Native Product is tap water, Mass/kg, without fixed treatment, geography or composition; historical other-goods classification is retained but active natural-water identity is coherent. Restrict to actual externally supplied tap water; independently record quality, temperature, source/provider and meter basis. It is not deionised water, boiler steam, wastewater or atmospheric sorption. Any changed water supply or actual separately returned condensate needs its own verified atomic flow and heat-state record.

###### Complete-leg gross dispatch (`fg_dispatch`)

Actual whole first-released leg dispatched from its original cohort, with actual current acceptance/hold status and gross measured mass. This is the manufactured wooden-furniture-part Product family, production mix at plant, Mass/kg, without fixed geography/size/species; restrict to the actual uncoated single-piece beech leg and included verified connector. Do not reuse a raw-lumber or whole-furniture flow. Full physical gross V is not a new first-release output Q or new manufacturing burden. Hold/reinspection/return history remains explicit; fragments or disposed damaged parts require the actual Waste identity.

###### Corrugated shipping carton (`carton_s`)

One actual complete corrugated-paperboard transport carton of the declared construction and configuration, not a collection of cartons, plastic bags, film, liners or other packaging. The compatible atomic Product-flow UUID remains unresolved. Record the actual board/flute/ply configuration, fibre composition, coatings/lamination, wet condition, integral adhesives/fasteners and supplier scope; no generic fibre fraction, treatment, size, weight or lifetime is assumed. Include integral supplied constituents once within the whole carton, while actually separate inserts, tape or other materials retain their own disjoint rows and one upstream owner. Keep this card's existing P/I/ER/S/EO role as defined by the packaging boundary and raw protocol, including packaging_receipt_basis where present; a new provider identity must not change that event definition. Retain the complete measured wet gross quantity and the original event/gate/custody/cohort in the card's stated Mass/kg unit, whether immediately used or retained at closing. Keep opening/closing empty, attached and reusable stock, internal reuse and independently measured material/water-change legs; no stock, burden or economic-share correction shrinks the gross leg. Actual manufacture/service burdens are attributed once separately using the existing original-cohort rule and sole normalization; a gross receipt or outflow alone creates no new manufacture, procurement burden, provider link or credit. Resolve a physically compatible carton identity/provider before binding it; missing identity is disclosed and never replaced with a mixed packaging category or an invented UUID.

###### Discarded packaging — Corrugated shipping carton (`carton_w`)

Physical leg W for this one material pool, conditional on its actual occurrence. This Waste card applies only to a real separately externalised material stream. If co-collected with another packaging material in one actual mixed outlet, retain its W pool measurement but use only mixed_packaging_waste externally, not both this component and the mixed total. Numerator is the complete actual gross-leg V in its native unit, never a manufacturing/service burden vector, stock-corrected consumption or economic share.

##### Elementary flows

###### Nitrogen in actual air exhaust (`n2_h_out`)

Individual ordinary gaseous Nitrogen, CAS 7727-37-9, in real air intake/exhaust. Measure full gross mass independently of burden shares, actual destination and state; air circulation alone is not chemical production or a purchased pure gas.

###### Ordinary water vapour leaving (`water_vapour_h`)

Include independently observed moisture loss from normal processing/storage/handling as well as actual cleaning/repair. A permitted operation is not required for natural loss; any actual unauthorised/failed work still retains full loads and hold/waste disposition. Native Elementary is ordinary water vapour, CAS 7732-18-5, emissions to air unspecified, Mass/kg, no fixed geography. The synonym list contains liquid water, ice, bound water and heavy/tritiated/isotopic labels; these are not adopted as the actual gas. Use independently measured ordinary H2O vapour at this destination only. This is outgoing water from ordinary processing/storage/handling as well as cleaning; it does not prove a reaction or default evaporation. Known other compartments need newly matched identities.

## 7. Allocation and Co-product Handling

| rule_id | Applies to | Rule | source_ids |
| --- | --- | --- | --- |
| allocation_framework | all burden vectors | Use attributional modelling only in situations actually requiring allocation under the cited ILCD scope. First assign dedicated operations/materials and subdivide physically or virtually by actual function. A woodturning manufacturer page supports route, not LCA allocation or a fixed share. | `ilcd-attributional-2010` |
| allocation_causality | each still-shared exchange | For each remaining exchange identify a determining physical causal relation, with evidence and sensitivity. Material embodiment, electricity load/time, occupied storage capacity/time and transport limiting mass/volume may differ; no blanket mass/time rule and no arbitrary physical/economic choice. Keep causal driver and burden vector separate from full physical gross mass. | `ilcd-attributional-2010` |
| allocation_residual | genuinely residual common process | Only if subdivision and exchange-specific causality leave a justified residual, allocate that residual at the same actual process gate and contemporary market value in each actual state/quality/quantity. Trace back later packing, conditioning and transport to that gate. Document units/currency/time, sensitivity and total-vector conservation; no fixed ratio. | `ilcd-attributional-2010` |
| allocation_failures | manufacture and treatment | Keep ordinary manufacturing rejects, breakage, samples, emissions and their handling/treatment burdens with the relevant manufacturing cohort even when exported/sold. T_other is permitted only for a real distinct other cohort/function and a justified one-time allocation/handover with counterpart receipt. Waste sales alone are not that evidence; recycling/true-joint-process provisions need an explicit applicable review, not automatic credit. | `ilcd-attributional-2010` |
| allocation_service | original cohort H and assets | Attribute only actual service over H to original cohort Q_H. Performed storage/handling/maintenance service is retained despite closing FG; carry forward only unused unassigned service/charge. Separate full physical asset stocks from actual service burden, with measured usage, new/old/repaired parts and fluids, remaining vector and no fixed life or one whole machine per kg. Stock-corrected consumption is not corrected a second time. | `ilcd-attributional-2010` |

## 8. Foreground Data Collection, Calculation, and Quality Rules

The protocol aggregation label “per reference flow” identifies only the final basis of the single quotient in section 8. Every protocol still collects unnormalised raw observations with original units, real events and the raw aggregation constraints below; collection does not divide by Q or divide an already-normalised q again. Service accounts use original Q_H over observed H; gross-card numerators are complete V, never stock-corrected consumption or burden shares.

Weigh samples immediately with validated oven-dry method or species/temperature-calibrated electrical method; retain volatile-extractive and moisture-gradient limitations.

Supplier-included I remains physical ingress with one upstream owner. Record disjoint mixed-outlet component pools; do not add their W cards to the one actual mixed Waste. Raw aggregation constraints: Collect full gross raw V by each leg; no stock correction or allocation on gross cards; independent burden service ledger; no division here. Independently record true F_in/F_out without residual fitting. X subtracts only documented duplicate physical quantity already in another real same-side flow, never stock, opposite-side flow, card presence or retained closing influx.  For packaging only, apply packaging_receipt_basis; standalone non-purchase is I, never invented ER or X. Qualify each ER by the same-article/batch prior S/EO and linked receipt history, with traceable membership, original boundary/cohort and earlier-period/offsite custody where necessary; match identity and state independently of mass equality. Earlier use elsewhere, the same UUID/material, equal mass or a burden handover alone is insufficient. Independently weigh actual returned wet mass/state rather than copying outward mass. Apply packaging_receipt_basis: proven paid receipts are P; proven first non-purchased/replacement whole articles, new or previously used elsewhere, are I; only qualified same-item returns are ER. If history or paid/non-purchased status cannot establish one category, keep one full measured provisional atomic whole-article F_in, with an explicit evidence gap requiring resolution before dataset acceptance. For each actual carton, film or pallet, use one independent row/event ID, its physically specific flow identity and complete native restrictions, never a packaging aggregate or invented UUID. For proven I, use the existing matching atomic I card; for provisional F_in, retain its own atomic receipt record before dataset use. Both require the complete Amount chain: expression A / Q with A = V, the full independently measured received wet kg, and Q = original Q_H through calc_quotient only; value_mode calculated_value; specificity site_specific; basis text per 1 kg reference flow and kind reference_flow; evidence kind calculated_from_collection, collection_protocol_id cp_packaging, source_ids [ilcd-attributional-2010]; ranges empty unless independently supported. Raw collection here never divides. P, I, qualified ER and provisional whole-article F_in classify each receipt exclusively; move the same provisional event to its one final P/I/ER category without a second receipt or provider burden. Separate whole received mass from other repair/new-material/water F terms; contained constituents stay subledgers, never second inlets. Retain one documented previous-owner/supplier burden handover independently of physical V; nonpurchase does not imply zero or another manufacture charge. Keep inherited manufacturing/service vectors and genuinely unused service separate from actual performed original-cohort service. Supplier-included transport/handling/service is not procured again; distinct actual incremental service remains assigned once to its proper original cohort Q_H over H, even for closing FG. Full wet closing stock retains articles still held and never cancels their actual inlet. | kg | every receipt/shipment/return/discard and opening/closing | original cohort actual horizon H | empty stores WIP FG reusable custody and real receiver | per reference flow | six-leg ledger; scales; stock/repair/water bridge; one provider/treatment receipt; source pools; same-article/batch outward-to-return links; custody/member register; independently weighed receipt/state; first-receipt or unresolved-history/payment record; atomic I/provisional F_in complete Amount and single burden owner; inherited vector handover and disjoint included/incremental service evidence |

Raw aggregation constraints: Collect unnormalised gross physical legs and usage; separately assign actual service and carry only unused/unassigned vector; never divide here.

### Calculation Rules

| rule_id | Applies to | Formula or rule | Inputs | Output | source_ids |
| --- | --- | --- | --- | --- | --- |
| calc_raw_units | all inventory rows | U is original unnormalised activity after one legitimate unit conversion. Cumulative kWh ×3.6 gives electrical MJ; t*km ×1000 gives kg*km. For concentration use measured cumulative volume once; integrate only an actual rate. Density is independently measured for the actual substance/state. No default heat/water conversion. | raw records; calibrated units; state | U | `usda-wood-handbook-2021` |
| calc_manufacturing | all inventory rows | For the burden dimension only, A = B_open + U_attributed - B_close - T_other. B_open/B_close are exchange-specific inherited vectors in raw/WIP and unused unassigned charges; closing released FG is excluded. T_other needs a real distinct other function/cohort plus justified one-time handover; ordinary waste/reject/sample sales are not T_other. If U is already stock-corrected consumption, set corresponding stock terms to zero after documented reconciliation; never correct twice. This rule is not applied to physical gross cards. | B_open; U_attributed; B_close; T_other | A | `ilcd-attributional-2010` |
| calc_service | all inventory rows | For an actual service account H, A is the actually performed original-cohort service plus prior assigned service vector used in H, after justified sharing and single ownership; Q denotes original Q_H. Closing released FG never reverses performed service. Only unused/unassigned charge/service vector is carried forward; asset embodiment is assigned by real capacity/use, not full purchase mass per kg. Keep service physical mass and inherited manufacturing vector separately. | H; Q_H; actual service; asset vectors; unused unassigned charges | A | `ilcd-attributional-2010` |
| calc_gross | all inventory rows | For every card explicitly marked gross, A = V, the actual complete external physical leg in native extensive units. No B_open+U-B_close, economic share, allocated burden, net delivered mass or stock retention modifies V. Physical X terms remove only overlap with another real inlet/outlet. Gross q is disclosure only and never automatically multiplied by a second supplier/treatment burden or credited; the true burden dimension is assigned once independently. | V; real direction; disjoint source pools | A | `ilcd-attributional-2010` |
| calc_quotient | all inventory rows | q = A / Q. Apply this sole division once after calc_raw_units and the one applicable burden/service or gross numerator rule. Manufacturing Q is unique first-release net kg; service/gross service accounts use original Q_H for observed H. Reference output is exactly 1 kg. For Q=0 retain A and V and report no unit q; no artificial zero. Cards and collection aggregation refer to this same q and never divide it again. | A; Q; Q_H; H | q | `ilcd-attributional-2010` |
| calc_packaging_balance | all inventory rows | For each whole packaging material pool: O + P + I + ER + F_in - X_in = C + S + EO + W + F_out - X_out. O/C include full wet empty, attached-WIP, attached-FG and reusable stocks; S is gross physical shipment, not net Q. P/I partition the same received article mutually exclusively. Independently measure actual repair/new-material and ordinary moisture/water-phase F_in/F_out; do not fit them from a residual. X removes only a proven duplicate already present in an OTHER real same-side flow term with matched event identity, never stock, opposite-side flow, card presence or closing retention. True retained new influx and full wet C both remain. Internal handovers cancel. One real mixed outlet uses one measured whole Waste/provider, with disjoint measured W source pools summing within uncertainty; total and component exchanges do not add. ER is permitted only for the linked same-article/auditable-batch prior S/EO from this boundary and original cohort; independently measure actual returned wet mass/state, not copied outward mass. Proven first external non-purchased/replacement whole articles use I under packaging_receipt_basis, with the independent atomic row/event and complete Amount/collection chain in cp_packaging, not an additional final whole-article F_in. Unknown history or paid/non-purchased status remains one explicitly provisional measured whole-article F_in pending evidence and final P/I/ER classification, mutually exclusive with those categories and disjoint from other repair/material/water F terms. Earlier use elsewhere is not return history. Reclassification moves that one event and its single burden handover, never adds another physical receipt/provider burden. Retention in full wet C never removes the actual inlet; the existing same-side duplicate-only X conditions still apply. | O; P; I; ER; C; S; EO; W; F_in; F_out; X_in; X_out | physical balance | `ilcd-attributional-2010` |
| calc_physical | all inventory rows | At each manufacturing/FG/consolidated gate, opening full wet stock + all actual external inflows = closing full wet stock + all actual external outflows, allowing only independently established transformations and measurement uncertainty. Internal transfers cancel. Wet wood = independently established dry wood + measured wood water; u = (wet-dry)/dry and dry = wet/(1+u) only for the isolated wood fraction. Do not subtract attached connector/abrasive mass twice. Preserve each relevant elemental balance and carbon origin separately; no single-residual fit of water and species. | full wet O; full wet C; gross inflows; gross outflows; measured phases and elements | physical balance | `usda-wood-handbook-2021` |

### Data Quality Requirements

| requirement_id | Applies to | Requirement | Evidence |
| --- | --- | --- | --- |
| dq_identity | reference and all real exchanges | Actual configuration, product/route, native restrictions and upstream provider scope must agree; unknown auxiliary identity is not zero. | approved drawing; full BOM; supplier data; original native context |
| dq_mass | all measured mass and water | Representative moisture, full wet stock and independent water/solid/element evidence; calibration, sampling gradients and volatile extractives uncertainty remain explicit. | paired masses; moisture method; scale records; uncertainty |
| dq_complete | all period and H | Include ordinary failures/zero output/start-stop/idle/cleanup/samples, real unauthorised work and actual held/waste disposition; no missing atom hidden as other. | production/service logs; incident and disposition records |
| dq_allocation | each residual burden | Document dedicated/virtual subdivision, exchange-specific causal decision, true common-gate residual value, total vector conservation and sensitivity; no gross mass shares. | allocation worksheet; counterpart receipts; original unnormalised records |
| dq_sources | all sources and temporal scope | Sources support the declared need and original context; manufacturer product/route evidence is not a numerical factory dataset or scientific/translation approval. | full sources; source-to-rule applicability; site/time/provider disclosure |

## 9. Validation Rules

| rule_id | Applies to | Rule | source_ids |
| --- | --- | --- | --- |
| validation_identity | reference and every card | Match complete native name/synonyms/comments, CAS when meaningful, material/phase/form/route/grade/geography/compartment/type and every property before binding. UUID has no dataset-version suffix in canonical content; exact versions are external identity evidence. Wrong raw-wood/whole-furniture core references are blocking. Auxiliary/provider/quantity gaps remain explicit and do not fabricate a core identity hold. | `richman-unfinished-leg`; `drewbak-components` |
| validation_reference | finished_leg and collection | There is one complete Product reference output linked by finished_leg, measured kg and unique first release. Counts require each actual same-configuration net complete-leg mass with moisture/calibration, never a guessed item kg or secondary property/density. Item(s) and item mean factor1 count only; this PCR does not change to an area or count denominator. | `usda-wood-handbook-2021` |
| validation_normalization | all inventory rows | Preserve unnormalised raw records, conversions and allocation before the sole quotient. Burden rows use attributed A; gross cards use full V as A with no stock/economic correction, automatic provider multiplication or second credit. Q=0 retains all real load and has no per-unit result. Service uses original Q_H over H. | `ilcd-attributional-2010` |
| validation_balance | manufacture FG and consolidated | Independently reconcile full physical mass, water and relevant elements, including moisture gain/loss, wood-biogenic, oil/packaging fossil and ambient carbon. Distinguish free/sorbed water and actual structural/reaction water; one residual cannot fit two unknowns, and no dry-machining reaction is presumed. COD/VOC/dust/element totals do not specify molecules. No whole-air aggregate plus species double count. | `usda-wood-handbook-2021` |
| validation_packaging | each material P I ER S EO W | Each real packaging material has separate six-direction cards and complete wet opening/closing empty/attached-WIP/FG/reusable stocks. Repair/new water X terms remove only genuine flow overlap. If a real mixed outlet exists, its one Waste exchange replaces external component-W cards while all W source pools remain traceable. Internal reuse cancels; whole article/component sums and treatment/provider each occur once. F_in/F_out are independently observed true increments; X is only a matched duplicate of an OTHER actual same-side flow. Neither stock nor the opposite side nor card presence permits X; no retained influx is cancelled against full wet closing stock. Verify article identity or auditable batch membership, this boundary/original cohort, actual prior outward S/EO and linked return receipt with necessary earlier-period/offsite custody evidence before accepting ER. Previous use, burden handover, the same UUID/material or equal mass is insufficient; independently measured returned wet mass/state may differ. Proven first non-purchased/replacement ingress requires its own atomic I event and the complete cp_packaging Amount/collection chain. Unresolved history or paid/non-purchased status retains one full measured provisional atomic whole-article F_in and an explicit classification gap requiring resolution to one P/I/ER category before dataset acceptance, never a fabricated return, purchase or zero. I, qualified ER, P and provisional F_in are mutually exclusive; other repair/material/water F terms and contained constituents do not duplicate the whole receipt. Reclassification moves the one event without duplicated inlet/provider or deletion against closing stock. Verify inherited manufacture/service history, one burden handover, supplier-included scope and distinct incremental actual service; preserve performed original-cohort services and genuinely unused remaining vectors separately, with the sole original Q_H quotient. | `ilcd-attributional-2010` |
| validation_uncertainty | all foreground data | Unknown means collect/review with explicit bounds, not pass or zero. Retain missing core evidence as an applicability hold; actual site/provider/auxiliary data require collection. Engineering checks establish declared consistency only, not scientific approval, translation review, classification coverage or publication. | `ilcd-attributional-2010` |
