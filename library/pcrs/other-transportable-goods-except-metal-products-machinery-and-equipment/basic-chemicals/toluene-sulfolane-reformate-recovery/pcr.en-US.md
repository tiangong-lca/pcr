# Toluene recovered from reformate by wet sulfolane extraction and fractionation

## 1. Scope and Applicability

This attributional manufacturing PCR covers bulk commercial liquid toluene recovered from received extraction-ready fossil reformate by wet sulfolane liquid-liquid extraction, rich-solvent stripping, vacuum solvent recovery, raffinate water washing, solvent regeneration, clay polishing and benzene/toluene fractionation. The C8-plus bottom cut leaves without further purification. Heat is purchased steam; cooling is a recirculating-water loop. [jrc-lvoc-2017, §4.2.2.2]

Exclude upstream catalytic reforming and required hydrofining from the foreground, while retaining their verified upstream burdens. Exclude pygas/coal-tar feed, ED-only/dry-solvent/NMP/DMF/DMSO routes, toluene synthesis or disproportionation, solvent-blend formulation, spent-solvent recycling, xylene isomerisation and onsite fuel combustion. If the actual site adds these operations, extend and review its inventory before claiming applicability; this PCR does not make them disappear. Current ED Sulfolane vendor specifications describe a different simplified option and are not defaults here. [honeywell-aromatics-recovery; jrc-lvoc-2017]

## 3. Reference Flow

| Field | Value |
| --- | --- |
| What | Supply commercial toluene as a chemical feedstock |
| How much | 1 kg |
| How well | Accepted actual commercial grade with measured toluene assay, water and specified impurities; no universal purity is assumed |
| How long or cycle | One plant-gate delivery; no downstream use lifetime |
| reference_flow_link | accepted_toluene |

| Field | Value |
| --- | --- |
| Reference amount | 1 |
| Reference product flow | Toluene `33ac34b7-d691-4eda-8563-daef49a05157` |
| Reference flow property | Mass `93a60a56-a3c8-11da-a746-0800200b9a66` |
| Reference unit group | Units of mass `93a60a57-a4c8-11da-a746-0800200c9a66` |
| Reference unit | kg |
| Required qualifiers | CAS108-88-3; whole commercial product; assay and method; water and benzene/non-aromatic impurities; acceptance specification; liquid temperature/pressure; bulk plant delivery gate; wet sulfolane reformate route; actual site/provider and period; feed readiness; immutable first-acceptance event/cohort and Q/Q0; same-basis D_new/FG_new/L_new destinations; upstream boundaries and allocation method |

Keep the official native Toluene identity and whole-grade mass. Its general liquid chemical meaning allows declared residual commercial impurities; it cannot identify a deliberately diluted blend. Neither native production-mix wording nor a CAS alone establishes provider compatibility or a route-average dataset.

## 4. Measurement and Unit Rules

| rule_id | Applies to | Required property | Required unit | Rule |
| --- | --- | --- | --- | --- |
| reference_mass | reference product | Mass | kg | Use net whole liquid product mass, excluding tank/container tare; 1 kg reference flow is not multiplied by toluene assay. Measure assay separately with cp_reference. First-acceptance Q is locked to the original whole-product event mass; later physical dispositions use measured conversions back to that same basis, not a new Q. |
| volume_mass | reformate_feed; accepted_toluene; water_makeup; cooling_makeup | Mass | kg | Convert measured liquid volume using measured or traceable composition-specific density at the same temperature and pressure; disclose corrections and avoid converting wet mixtures by neat-toluene density. |
| utility_bases | electricity; indirect_steam; direct_steam; condensate_return | Energy and Mass | MJ; kg | 1 kWh=3.6 MJ for electricity. Steam commodity and returned condensate remain kg with recorded states. Heat check=sum(incoming kg times specific enthalpy)-sum(returned kg times specific enthalpy), with a common datum and kJ divided by 1000 to MJ. Keep direct steam/water-stripper recycles separate. Never impose a generic MJ/kg factor or buy the same steam twice. |

## 5. System Boundary

### Boundary Abstraction

| Field | Value |
| --- | --- |
| declared_starting_condition | Actual extraction-ready reformate received at the recovery unit, with feed composition and upstream readiness evidence |
| starting_condition_role | foreground_entry |
| product_classification_scope | CPC 3.0 34110; narrower |
| recursive_input_rule | Purchased same-category toluene is an evidenced upstream input with burdens, never new recovered output or an internal recycle. Split it into an added atomic input and do not dilute it into production Q. |
| upstream_dataset_requirement | Actual reformate provider includes reforming, splitting and required feed treatment; utility, solvent/clay and external treatment links match composition/property/gate |
| disclosure | Record actual source plant, feed batch/readiness, all gates, utility return convention, outsourced treatment, omitted operations and inventory gaps |

| rule_id | applies_to | rule | source_ids |
| --- | --- | --- | --- |
| boundary_route | recovery_unit | Include receipt/storage, every extraction/recovery/regeneration/wash/clay/fractionation operation, internal transfers, start/stop/cleaning losses, loading and final releases. No upstream refinery unit is duplicated or assumed burden-free. Additional actual chemicals, packaging, regeneration or controls require individual physical exchanges before completeness. | `jrc-lvoc-2017` |
| boundary_acceptance | accepted_toluene | Q>0 is the sum of net whole-product kg measured at unique first-acceptance events in the declared period, each immutable event/lot counted once on its original acceptance basis. Reconcile Q = D_new + FG_new + L_new for that same newly accepted cohort and basis: D_new is net dispatch after linked returns, FG_new is closing accepted FG, and L_new covers all other net post-acceptance destinations, including actual net returns not already in D_new/FG_new, loss, scrap, downgrade, use and closing transfer back to rework/WIP. Keep these destinations mutually exclusive and exhaustive, resolving basis changes from measured records. D_new+FG_new alone is permitted only with evidence that all other net destinations are zero. Later losses never lower Q; opening FG, purchased product, pre-acceptance rejects, returns, retests, reacceptance and internal gross loops never add Q. Old accepted lots retain their original Q0. | `jrc-ilcd-general-2010` |
| boundary_carry | recovery_unit | Carry raw-feed, solvent, bed, WIP and FG mass/component stocks with their accumulated upstream and operation burden vectors by lot/cohort. Carry partial raw/WIP burdens forward until first acceptance; add only incremental processing, including actual failed/rejected/rework operations attributable to the cohort, avoiding a second feed burden. Failed output creates no Q before its first acceptance. Accepted material returned to WIP retains its original event and burden vector; reacceptance adds no Q. Opening FG dispatch is a transfer of its original burden. Later storage/loss/return/repair service corrections attach to the original accepted cohort and original accepted quantity Q0; never divide them by current Q. If Q0 is unknown, preserve raw unnormalised burdens and hold the correction, rather than inventing a denominator. | `jrc-ilcd-general-2010` |

## 7. Allocation and Co-product Handling

| rule_id | applies_to | rule | source_ids |
| --- | --- | --- | --- |
| allocation_subdivide | recovery_unit | Retain unallocated whole-stream mass/component/water/energy balances first. Subdivide metered operations and assign directly identifiable product storage, loading and dedicated column duties to the product that causes them. Keep raffinate, benzene and C8-plus product services, mixed residuals and shared solvent recovery visible; no physical coproduct quantity is scaled by an allocation share. | `jrc-ilcd-general-2010`; `jrc-lvoc-2017` |
| allocation_causality | recovery_unit | For each remaining joint burden, test and document physical causality from measured component recovery and operation responses. Mass share is permissible only for a burden demonstrably driven by handled mass; use a relevant measured constituent share where composition causes the burden. Energy allocation is limited to actual useful energy products on an evidenced calorific/enthalpy basis; chemical BTX and raffinate are not all fuel services. No universal mass or heat-value default applies. | `jrc-ilcd-general-2010` |
| allocation_residual | recovery_unit | For residual joint burdens without determining physical causality, use disclosed study-consistent economic shares a_i=m_i*p_i/sum(m_j*p_j) across actual useful co-products at their separation gates, using observed same-period net prices, consistent currency and positive value. Document missing/zero/negative-price cases for review, not fabricated shares. Test plausible price sensitivity; do not combine attributed burdens with avoided-product credits. Waste treatment remains with the causing process; internal solvent/water loops, condensate return and captured gas awaiting abatement have no saleable-product share. | `jrc-ilcd-general-2010` |

## 8. Foreground Data Collection, Calculation, and Quality Rules

### Data Collection Protocols

| protocol_id | process_id | flow_role | record_type | raw_fields | collection_method | unit | frequency | temporal_coverage | site_scope | aggregation_rule | quality_evidence |
| --- | --- | --- | --- | --- | --- | --- | --- | --- | --- | --- | --- |
| cp_reference | recovery_unit | accepted_toluene | measurement | lot id; immutable first-acceptance event id/time; measured net accepted whole kg; original acceptance basis; assay/water/impurities; specification; liquid state; tare/density; net D_new dispatch and linked returns; FG_new closing accepted stock; disjoint L_new net return/loss/scrap/downgrade/use/rework-WIP destinations; opening FG; retests/reacceptance; failed/rework operations; basis conversions/uncertainty; Q; original Q0 | Calibrated net weighing or temperature-corrected tank gauging with measured compatible density; chromatographic assay and water analysis. Lock Q to the sum of unique measured first-acceptance event masses. Reconcile the same lots on the same acceptance basis using exhaustive mutually exclusive D_new/FG_new/L_new: subtract linked returns from dispatch and locate their remaining net destination once in FG_new or L_new; resolve actual basis changes without treating gross loops as new quantity. Reacceptance never changes Q. Preserve separate actual-period external exchanges and all raw/WIP/FG stocks. | kg | Every batch or continuous meter; full-period reconciliation | One declared complete operating period including start/stop | Actual recovery unit and declared route | per 1 kg reference flow | Calibration, raw assays, immutable event records, complete lot destination reconciliation and disclosed gaps |
| cp_material | recovery_unit | reformate_feed; sulfolane_makeup | measurement | supplier; exact formulation; whole kg; component assay; feed readiness; fresh supply; transfers; opening/closing raw solvent WIP and carried burden vector | Weigh or gauge every fresh receipt; assay representative batches; reconcile independent lean/rich/stripper/recovery/wash transfer meters and sampled components. | kg | Every batch or continuous meter; full-period reconciliation | One declared complete operating period including start/stop | Actual recovery unit and declared route | per 1 kg reference flow | Calibration, raw assays, lot reconciliation and disclosed gaps |
| cp_utility | recovery_unit | electricity; indirect_steam; direct_steam; condensate_return; water_makeup; cooling_makeup | measurement | operation; meter; kWh; steam kg T P dryness enthalpy; return kg state; water kg; evaporative and blowdown terms; supplier convention; losses; calibration | Submeter extraction, recovery/regeneration and each column/cooling operation; separate direct and indirect steam and physical water. Reconcile purchased utilities and the complete steam/condensate/water balance. | MJ; kg | Every batch or continuous meter; full-period reconciliation | One declared complete operating period including start/stop | Actual recovery unit and declared route | per 1 kg reference flow | Calibration, raw assays, lot reconciliation and disclosed gaps |
| cp_consumable | recovery_unit | clay_charge; nitrogen | measurement | actual formulation; fresh charge kg; campaign; retained bed mass; removal; blanketing use; meter states; gas conversion; incremental service ledger | Record issues and stocks, actual fresh/spent campaigns and independently measured service usage. A shared campaign splits only the service burden by evidenced use; full physical exchange remains in its real period. | kg | Every batch or continuous meter; full-period reconciliation | One declared complete operating period including start/stop | Actual recovery unit and declared route | per 1 kg reference flow | Calibration, raw assays, lot reconciliation and disclosed gaps |
| cp_outputs | recovery_unit | benzene_coproduct; c8_aromatic_cut; raffinate | measurement | stream id; whole kg; all measured constituents; destination; sale/use evidence; separation gate; net price; currency; stocks; burden vector | Independently weigh or gauge and assay each distinct output; reconcile acceptance and buyer records without turning an undivided cut into pure components. | kg | Every batch or continuous meter; full-period reconciliation | One declared complete operating period including start/stop | Actual recovery unit and declared route | per 1 kg reference flow | Calibration, raw assays, lot reconciliation and disclosed gaps |
| cp_wastes | recovery_unit | solvent_regenerator_residue; spent_clay; process_effluent; cooling_blowdown | measurement | source; whole kg or volume and density; composition including water; campaign; receiver; treatment; stocks; manifest; leach/analyte record | Measure every actual removal and retain separate originating streams, treatment interface and composition. Reconcile fresh/spent and water balances; select real treatment, never assumed generic disposal. | kg | Every batch or continuous meter; full-period reconciliation | One declared complete operating period including start/stop | Actual recovery unit and declared route | per 1 kg reference flow | Calibration, raw assays, lot reconciliation and disclosed gaps |
| cp_releases | recovery_unit | captured_vent; benzene_air; toluene_air; oxylene_air; mxylene_air; pxylene_air; ethylbenzene_air; sulfolane_air; sulfur_dioxide_air; nitrogen_air; water_vapour_air | measurement | outlet; species CAS; phase; concentration; wet/dry gas flow; T P; operating time; controls; captured transfer; final residual; detection limits; water evaporation | Screen actual component releases and measure representative routine/start-stop/loading/fugitive conditions; integrate concentration with compatible exhaust flow and hours. Keep transfer and residual boundaries separate; add every other actual species atomically. | kg | Every batch or continuous meter; full-period reconciliation | One declared complete operating period including start/stop | Actual recovery unit and declared route | per 1 kg reference flow | Calibration, raw assays, lot reconciliation and disclosed gaps |

### Calculation Rules

| rule_id | Applies to | Formula or rule | Inputs | Output | source_ids |
| --- | --- | --- | --- | --- | --- |
| normalize_period | all inventory rows | Divide each cumulative physical exchange belonging to the newly first-accepted cohort, including inherited upstream/WIP terms, actual failed/rework operations and post-acceptance services/losses within the declared scope, by event-locked positive Q; accepted_toluene equals 1 kg as a reference accounting coordinate, not an additional external physical output. Carry inherited vectors once and add incremental operations once. Retain unallocated physical ledgers and units. Compute separately attributed burden vectors using subdivision and documented joint shares, then divide each cohort vector by its own original accepted quantity Q or Q0. Never erase coproduct mass, shrink Q after losses, count reacceptance again or move opening-FG service into current Q. | cp_reference; period records; cohort ledger | per 1 kg reference flow | `jrc-ilcd-general-2010` |
| acceptance_event_bridge | recovery_unit | Q = sum of unique measured first-acceptance event masses on the declared whole-product acceptance basis; Q = D_new + FG_new + L_new is a complete same-basis destination check, not a replacement denominator. Net linked returns out of D_new must be located once in FG_new or their actual L_new destination; track internal transfers/reacceptance without adding gross passes. Reconcile measured composition/water/basis changes explicitly. For 100 kg first accepted, 60 kg net dispatched, 30 kg closing FG and 10 kg post-acceptance loss, Q=100 kg and an attributed burden of 100 units gives 100/100=1 unit/kg; the incomplete 90 kg denominator would give 100/90=1.111... and is invalid. Unexplained residuals remain unresolved; never infer zero loss or rewrite Q to force closure. | cp_reference; event ledger; same-basis destination and stock records | locked Q and complete destination bridge | `jrc-ilcd-general-2010` |
| component_balance | recovery_unit | For each whole stream use measured component kg=whole kg times its measured mass fraction. For total mass and conserved elemental C/H/S, check external input plus opening raw/WIP/FG stocks equals actual external outputs plus closing raw/WIP/FG stocks, with zero net elemental generation. This storage-inclusive physical boundary uses net external dispatch and actual losses/waste/releases once; Q and internal acceptance/rework transfers are not additional external outputs. Keep actual-period physical amounts separate from same-acceptance-basis D_new/FG_new/L_new and reconcile conversions explicitly. For each reactive chemical species X, including sulfolane degradation and water, use opening X + external input X + actual G_X = closing X + external output X + actual C_X; establish actual formation/consumption from matched analysis or supported stoichiometry with measured reaction extent. Unknown species conversion remains unresolved; do not impose species conservation or assume complete degradation. Retain measured losses and uncertainty. Keep raw/WIP/FG burden vectors separate from physical mass. Unknown residual is a finding, never a fictitious product or zero. | cp_reference; cp_material; cp_outputs; cp_wastes; cp_releases; stocks | unallocated component and water balances | `jrc-lvoc-2017`; `jrc-ilcd-general-2010` |
| heat_check | indirect_steam; direct_steam; condensate_return | Calculate net incoming-minus-return enthalpy using measured kg and same-datum states; kJ/1000=MJ. Track direct steam into process water and distinguish clean indirect return. Internal recovered heat/water is not a new supplier input or avoided-heat credit. | cp_utility; measured mass; specific enthalpy; states | physical heat and water check | `jrc-lvoc-2017` |
| release_integral | benzene_air; toluene_air; oxylene_air; mxylene_air; pxylene_air; ethylbenzene_air; sulfolane_air; sulfur_dioxide_air | Integrate species concentration times compatible gas-flow rate times operating duration, correct units, then divide by Q. Sum disjoint outlets/phases only; retain uncertainty and detection limits. Captured vent enters its external treatment once; do not count both captured molecules and treatment final emissions as direct releases here. | cp_releases; concentration; flow; time; Q | kg per 1 kg reference flow | `jrc-lvoc-2017` |

### Data Quality Requirements

| requirement_id | Applies to | Requirement | Evidence |
| --- | --- | --- | --- |
| quality_identity | all inventory rows | Confirm whole physical identity, type, phase/composition, property/unit and gate before linking a provider. Ordinary unresolved UUIDs/providers stay explicit gaps, not absent exchanges; product Toluene cannot identify an air emission. Native CPC35499 classification debt does not rewrite chemical CAS/type or the independent official CPC34110 scope. | Native records and supplier/receiver analysis |
| quality_coverage | recovery_unit | Cover normal and abnormal operation, component assay variation, solvent degradation, wash and steam-out discharges, actual cleaning/additives, stocks and every output destination. No JRC historical BB2 energy range or vendor purity/recovery number is a plant default. Add all actual omitted atomic exchanges before claiming completeness. | Full-period operations and missing-data register |
| quality_cohorts | cp_reference | Prove unique event-locked first-acceptance Q and the complete mutually exclusive same-basis D_new/FG_new/L_new bridge, including actual post-acceptance losses and net returns. Preserve raw/WIP/FG carryover and actual failed/rework burdens once, distinguish physical balances from acceptance events and retain original Q0 for all old-cohort service corrections. Unknown old denominator permits only a raw correction record pending review. Record sampling, basis-conversion and allocation uncertainty without invented tolerances. | Immutable event/lot-linked stock and destination records, burden vectors, calibration and acceptance records |

## 9. Validation Rules

| rule_id | applies_to | rule | source_ids |
| --- | --- | --- | --- |
| validate_identity | accepted_toluene | Require one whole liquid commercial Toluene reference output and all qualifiers; reject styrene/polymer, solvent blend, emission, wrong market gate or component-only quantity. Missing core identity blocks usable methodology; generic name alone cannot verify a study. | `jrc-lvoc-2017` |
| validate_quantities | all inventory rows | Require event-locked Q>0, finite nonnegative physical amounts, explicit signed net-return adjustments, a common period and the bilingual 1 kg basis. Verify unique first-acceptance masses and the exhaustive mutually exclusive same-basis D_new/FG_new/L_new bridge; later loss cannot reduce Q and opening FG, returns, reacceptance or internal loops cannot increase it. Test volume-density and fraction/percent conventions, full steam/return/water separation and storage-inclusive mass/component closure against measured uncertainty without adding Q as an external output. Keep failed/rework burdens and original-cohort Q0. Reject missing destinations, unexplained residuals, component-scaled product reference, recycling as fresh input and double steam heat burdens. | `jrc-lvoc-2017`; `jrc-ilcd-general-2010` |
| validate_allocation | recovery_unit | Check every saleable output and branch point, evidence for subdivision/causality and residual economic shares. Shares sum to one only for the relevant useful co-functions; retain full physical outputs, no avoided-product credit, waste/return exclusions and original-cohort Q0. Unresolved allocation is study review, never a fabricated passing factor. | `jrc-ilcd-general-2010` |
| validate_completeness | recovery_unit | Check final atmospheric species/phases, captured gas receiver, BTX/solvent water treatment, spent clay and solvent residue, supplier compatibility and stock vectors. Additional actual additives/emissions require atomic extensions. A passed structural/measurement check does not remove identity/provider/quantity gaps or confer scientific, translation or study approval. | `jrc-lvoc-2017`; `jrc-ilcd-general-2010` |

## 10. Published Dataset Profile

| Field | Value |
| --- | --- |
