# Oriented strand board (OSB)

## 1. Scope and Applicability

Applies to unoverlaid, resin-bonded wood OSB manufactured from long narrow strands with deliberately oriented face layers and a documented layer architecture. Face/core orientation, including a counteraligned or explicitly random core, must be declared; complete random layup is not OSB under this method. Three- and five-layer descriptions are evidence examples, not fixed requirements. The geometry, orientation distribution and grade documentation establish applicability, not a classification label alone. [usda-wood-handbook-2021; epa-osb-2002]

PF and pMDI routes, including layer-specific combinations and actual edge sealing, are covered. Excludes random particleboard, waferboard without the long-strand OSB architecture, MDF/HDF, veneer plywood, laminated strand lumber, nonwood panels, preservative-treated/fire-retardant formulations, face-overlaid products and different binder chemistry unless separately reviewed. Ordered wide wafers marketed as oriented waferboard are not automatically accepted as long-strand OSB. No fixed strength class, exposure class or building service life is assigned. [usda-wood-handbook-2021; epa-osb-2002]

## 3. Reference Flow

| Field | Value |
| --- | --- |
| What | Supply an accepted OSB panel material, without claiming an equal building service across grades |
| How much | 1 kg net finished OSB at declared dispatch moisture, excluding packaging |
| How well | Actual grade/standard, layer count/orientation, strand geometry, thickness, board density at defined moisture, layer binder recipe and surface state |
| How long or cycle | One production accounting period; no use-stage service life assigned |
| reference_flow_link | `finished_osb` |

| Field | Value |

| Reference amount | 1 |
| Reference product flow | Oriented strand board (OSB) `3291d1cf-a318-4271-9435-39534fa45e67` |

| Reference unit group | Units of mass `93a60a57-a4c8-11da-a746-0800200c9a66` |
| Reference unit | kg |
| Required qualifiers | Site/period and receiving gate; botanical species mix; strand dimensions and aspect-ratio distribution; layer count, face/core orientation and layup sequence; actual thickness, width/length and density at stated moisture; dry-/wet-basis moisture and method; net mass and rejected boards; exact commercial PF/pMDI formulations, solids and per-layer loading; wax/carrier water; grade, standard, exposure/performance class and actual acceptance tests; sanding/edge coating; supply and combustion/abatement route; no presumed service life |

Declare every required qualifier in the data package. This is a mass-based production reference, not a service functional unit for a building comparison. Geometry and moisture conversions must use the actual product, not an industry average.

## 4. Measurement and Unit Rules

| rule_id | Applies to | Required property | Required unit | Rule |
| --- | --- | --- | --- | --- |
| reference_mass | reference product | Mass | kg | Use calibrated net accepted finished-board dispatch mass in cp_reference; exclude packaging. |
| same_denominator | all inventory rows | Reference product mass | kg | Every exchange uses per 1 kg reference flow; sum attributable period totals and divide by net accepted finished OSB mass from cp_reference. |
| moisture_basis | wood and board measurements | Mass | kg | Collect actual wet and dry mass with cp_material/cp_reference. Dry-basis moisture u=(wet-dry)/dry; wet-basis w=(wet-dry)/wet; dry=wet/(1+u). Record denominator and method; adhesive/wax solids are not dry wood. For resin-bearing board, distinguish measured H2O from non-water oven losses or continuing cure; uncorrected oven mass loss is not automatically H2O or a conserved dry-resin amount. [usda-wood-handbook-2021] |
| energy_boundary | in_electricity, in_purchased_steam | Energy | MJ | Convert measured kWh to MJ using 3.6 MJ/kWh. For steam use measured delivered-minus-return enthalpy including condensate reference. A database MJ unit alone does not establish that boundary. |

## 5. System Boundary

### Boundary Abstraction

| Field | Value |
| --- | --- |
| declared_starting_condition | Receiving gate for logs with explicit bark status, or receiving gate for externally supplied green/dried unresinated strands; disclose transport already included |
| starting_condition_role | foreground_entry |
| product_classification_scope | CPC 3.0 31432 OSB subset stated in section 1; classification does not define grade |
| recursive_input_rule | Purchased OSB is not a raw strand input and cannot be recursively substituted. Rework stays in physical stock/transfer records; no duplicate finished reference output. |
| upstream_dataset_requirement | Matching forestry/log preparation, externally supplied strand production, each resin/wax/coating, fuel, electricity, water and packaging background; receiving-gate freight separately if absent upstream. External waste treatment must be linked. |
| disclosure | Foreground gate-to-gate, including onsite heat and controls; cradle-to-gate requires explicit upstream connections. Excludes installation, use and end of life unless separately modelled. |

Use one integrated foreground inventory p_osb through grading/packing. Preserve the following collection stages independently: s_receive (yard/conditioning/debarking/stranding only if inside the gate); s_dry (drying and screening, per face/core furnish); s_blend (separate layer recipe); s_form (orientation and layup); s_press (press cycle and cure); s_finish (cooling, trimming, optional sanding and edge sealing); s_pack; s_heat (boiler/thermal heater and actual internal heat recovery); s_control (dust collection/WESP/RTO/water treatment). [corrim-osb-us-2025; epa-osb-2002]

Assign direct-fired dryer fuel and the combined drying/combustion exhaust to s_dry; separate boiler fuel, ash and its stack to s_heat. Put RTO auxiliary fuel and final emissions at s_control. Shared dryer/press/RTO stacks are measured once after controls, with documented originating stages. Boiler AP-42 guidance does not supply direct-fired dryer factors. Recovered RTO heat lowers measured purchased fuel/heat; an internal loop is not a negative external heat export. Do not book useful onsite heat and its fuel as two purchased supplies. If heat leaves the plant, define one exact export flow and metered delivery boundary separately. [epa-osb-2002; epa-wood-boiler-2022]

## 7. Allocation and Co-product Handling

Maintain unallocated whole-mass/element ledgers and separate reaction-aware component ledgers under wood_water_carbon before burden allocation. Internal bark, untreated fines, resin-bearing trims and sanding dust have separate transfer records with source/destination, moisture, composition and equal handoff quantities at both ends. Internal reuse cancels at the aggregate plant boundary but remains visible in stage balances. Sold co-products, internal fuels and externally discarded wastes are mutually exclusive destinations for each portion. Never multiply physical co-product output or an internal link by an allocation fraction. [corrim-osb-us-2025]

Assign directly attributable resin, pressing, grade/finishing and packaging burdens to OSB. Subdivide joint stages before allocating residual shared burdens to marketed outputs; document a physically justified dry-material basis and test an economic alternative when the physical relationship is inadequate. The separate burden account may use a_j = d_j / sum(d_k), where d_j is measured eligible exported dry material of each joint output under one declared basis. Finished board dry solids include binder/wax and must not be called dry wood; disclose whether the causal allocation basis uses measured wood fraction or total dry solids. Internal fuel is not a marketed output in this export denominator: trace its processing and combustion to the heat consumer; shared exported energy requires a separate causal allocation. No automatic substitution credit. [corrim-osb-us-2025]

| cp_recipe | p_osb | each resin/wax/coating by layer | collected_record | commercial formulation, resin chemistry and residual reactive groups, solids method, carrier water, free monomer, face/core layer ID, dosing mass, layup orientation, cure settings and evidenced extent/pathways, retained cured composition, reaction H2O formation/consumption and CO2, uncertainty | Calibrated dosing/load-cell and supplier certificate reconciliation by layer; separate PF, pMDI, wax and carrier water. Use actual supplied formulation and representative cure/composition evidence to quantify only onsite reaction extent, including PF condensation water and pMDI water consumption/CO2 formation; distinguish other evidenced cure pathways, retained binder and unreacted material. No assumed full cure, sample recipe or universal yield; unknown extent remains unresolved. Count formulation and its constituent breakdown once, without repeating upstream resin manufacture. Sum measured consumption separately for each material and layer; divide by net accepted finished OSB mass. Record each actual complete resin/wax/coating supply once in its verified wet/dry provider basis; retain PF/pMDI/wax/active/carrier/additive analytical subledgers without extra purchases. Require supplier formulation preparation/delivery once; real independently purchased additions and onsite mixing/utilities stay separate. Preserve raw stock/loss/internal-transfer ledgers. | kg | per lot and monthly reconciliation | One representative production period with seasonal/grade coverage | Same site, grade/recipe and gate definition | per 1 kg reference flow | Calibration, source records, samples, supplier/test records and stock closure |
| cp_energy | p_osb | electricity, purchased heat, internal heat | collected_record | meter/stage, supply voltage/mix, kWh, steam mass/pressure/temperature, condensate return, reference enthalpy, useful heat, recovery routing | Calibrated stage meters; steam supply-return enthalpy balance and thermal-oil/hot-water circuit measurements; separate boiler, dryer, press and RTO ownership.

| cp_fuel | p_osb | each mass-based fuel by combustor; natural gas uses cp_gas | collected_record | fuel identity/route, receipts/stocks, wet mass, dry moisture, measured LHV, ash, actual elemental/species composition, carbon origin, boiler/dryer/RTO or mobile equipment ID, actual oxidation extent and products, combustion air/oxygen and inlet humidity, uncertainty | Calibrated fuel meters/weighing and stock balance with fuel analysis and source-specific combustion/exhaust evidence; retain air/oxygen/humidity and unburned gas/ash composition for mass/element and component balances. Separate internal untreated bark/fines from resin-bearing trim fuel; fossil binder carbon remains fossil. Do not assume full oxidation or universal combustion water/CO2 yields. Sum each externally consumed fuel separately by stage; divide by net accepted finished OSB mass; equal internal handoffs retained outside external totals | kg | per lot and monthly reconciliation | One representative production period with seasonal/grade coverage | Same site, grade/recipe and gate definition | per 1 kg reference flow | Calibration, source records, samples, supplier/test records and stock closure |

Reconcile molecular H2O using opening stock + inputs + evidenced formation = closing stock + outputs + evidenced consumption, including PF condensation, pMDI water reaction and actual dryer/boiler/RTO or mobile combustion as applicable. Distinguish carrier/wood/fuel moisture and incoming air humidity from reaction-generated water; phase change is a transfer, not formation/consumption. Pair steam, condensate and wet-abatement endpoints; do not infer exhaust solely from moisture removal. Use source-specific composition/extent or measurements and retain unresolved terms/uncertainty, without default yields. Sum new externally supplied water once; divide by net accepted finished OSB mass; no repeated circulation | kg | per lot and monthly reconciliation | One representative production period with seasonal/grade coverage | Same site, grade/recipe and gate definition | per 1 kg reference flow | Calibration, source records, samples, supplier/test records and stock closure |
| cp_packaging | p_osb | each packaging material | collected_record | material/route, stock, tare mass, packs dispatched, reuse/returns and replacements | Weigh actual consumed individual material, reconcile dispatch and replacements; keep separate from net board mass. Sum consumed dispatch material separately by identity; divide by net accepted finished OSB mass | kg | per lot and monthly reconciliation | One representative production period with seasonal/grade coverage | Same site, grade/recipe and gate definition | per 1 kg reference flow | Calibration, source records, samples, supplier/test records and stock closure |

For H2O/CO2 distinguish incoming moisture/background gas, cure products and combustion products; retain gross inlet/outlet quantities in the balance ledger and disclose how the actual net release is determined on a consistent basis. Do not add calculated formation again to a measured total that already includes it. Record missing versus zero, shared stack once, emission speciation and disjoint PM. Sum actual post-control emission mass separately by species/origin or disjoint size fraction; divide by net accepted finished OSB mass | kg | per lot and monthly reconciliation | One representative production period with seasonal/grade coverage | Same site, grade/recipe and gate definition | per 1 kg reference flow | Calibration, source records, samples, supplier/test records and stock closure |

Keep direct dryer, boiler/heater and RTO subtotals. Record quantity on its actual measured state first, then apply gas_volume_state only when both volume definitions are known. Sum consumed volume by stage in the same defined state and divide by net accepted finished OSB mass. Unknown basis leaves background linkage unresolved; no database secondary mass coefficient as density. | m3 | continuous metering with monthly reconciliation | same representative period as cp_reference | same site and gas supplier | per 1 kg reference flow | Meter calibration, gas analysis, supplier volume-basis declaration and exact background-unit correspondence |

### Calculation Rules

| rule_id | Applies to | Formula or rule | Inputs | Output | source_ids |
| --- | --- | --- | --- | --- | --- |
| gas_volume_state | in_gas | For the same gas amount, V_supplier = V_meter × (P_meter/P_supplier) × (T_supplier/T_meter) × (Z_supplier/Z_meter) × f_water; P is absolute Pa, T is K and Z is composition-specific compressibility. When converting wet meter volume to dry supplier volume, f_water = 1 - measured water mole fraction; f_water = 1 only if both definitions have the same moisture basis. This relationship requires consistent composition, no gas loss and documented meter/supplier state. Do not assume standard conditions, dry gas or Z=1. Unknown state/composition or an incompatible supplier definition leaves the background link unresolved. Divide the verified matched-state period volume by cp_reference net accepted OSB mass. | cp_gas; cp_reference; supplier state definition | supplier-matched m3 per 1 kg reference flow | oiml-gas-volume-2007 |
| period_normalization | all inventory rows | For each atomic exchange, divide the attributable period total by net accepted finished OSB mass in the same period; finished_osb = 1 kg. Aggregate sites by summed amounts / summed reference masses only for comparable grades/routes and disclosed weighting. | cp_reference; linked collection protocol | amount per 1 kg reference flow | corrim-osb-us-2025 |
| volume_density | reference product | Actual volume = sum(accepted panel length × width × thickness); actual wet density = corresponding net wet mass / actual volume. Convert area declarations using actual thickness and matched density/moisture, never nominal density or survey defaults. | cp_reference | Matched product volume/density and mass conversion | usda-wood-handbook-2021 |
| wood_water_carbon | p_osb stage ledger | For each declared stage and the aggregate plant boundary, reconcile unallocated whole-stream mass and elemental C/H/O: opening stock + inputs = closing stock + outputs, including actual fuel, combustion air/oxygen, incoming gas humidity, exhaust, wet residues and steam/condensate crossings. Use actual composition and compatible state; convert gas volume to mass only with evidenced state/composition. Internal transfers cancel only with matched endpoints. Do not count stocks again in stock-adjusted consumption. Separately, for each molecular species/reactive component use opening stock + inputs + evidenced formation = closing stock + outputs + evidenced consumption. Molecular H2O and dry resin/wood are not conserved through PF condensation, pMDI water-consuming CO2-producing cure or combustion/oxidation. Quantify actual onsite extent/pathways and retained composition, not full cure or generic yields; do not repeat upstream prepolymer condensation. Track biogenic wood versus fossil resin/fuel carbon, including pMDI-derived CO2 and unburned carbon. Keep uncertainty and unresolved terms explicit; never adjust logs, invent reaction amounts or omit biogenic CO2 to force closure. Formation/consumption terms are internal balance terms, not extra external exchanges; measured outputs already containing them are counted once. | cp_material; cp_recipe; cp_reference; cp_residue; cp_fuel; cp_gas; cp_water; cp_energy; cp_emission | Unallocated whole-mass/element ledgers and reaction-aware component ledgers, with uncertainty and unresolved terms | usda-wood-handbook-2021; corrim-osb-us-2025; epa-osb-2002; epa-wood-boiler-2022; frihart-joining-2023 |
| pm_partition | air_pm25, air_pmcoarse, air_pmover10 | For one compatible post-control sampling method, disjoint PM2.5–10 = cumulative PM10 - cumulative PM2.5; PM>10 = compatible total PM - cumulative PM10. Use only nonnegative supported differences; otherwise keep missing fractions unresolved. Do not sum PM10 with its PM2.5 subset or add condensable PM twice. | cp_emission | Disjoint outdoor-air fractions | epa-osb-2002; epa-wood-boiler-2022 |

### Data Quality Requirements

| requirement_id | Applies to | Requirement | Evidence |
| --- | --- | --- | --- |
| dq_scope | p_osb | Verify actual long-strand architecture and layer-specific recipe, receipt gate and grade. Do not generalize regional species or survey recipes to this product. | usda-wood-handbook-2021; corrim-osb-us-2025; epa-osb-2002 |
| dq_data | all inventory rows | Retain meter/test calibration, representative periods, stocks and missing-versus-zero treatment. Preserve source-specific formulation, reaction/oxidation extent, composition and method uncertainty for wood_water_carbon; unknown terms prevent a complete balance claim and are not inferred as zero or full conversion. A conditional absent flow requires evidence of absence; missing measurement is not zero. | collection protocols |
| dq_identity | all inventory rows | Exact physical/chemical flow, route, property and unit. Unresolved identities cannot be substituted by neighbouring products, mixed packaging, correction flows, generic VOC totals or mismatched medium. | flow identity and supplier records |

## 9. Validation Rules

| rule_id | Applies to | Rule | source_ids |
| --- | --- | --- | --- |
| v_reference | finished_osb | Exactly one finished reference output; net mass excludes packaging; all qualifiers and the actual layer architecture/grade must be provided. | corrim-osb-us-2025 |
| v_basis | all inventory rows | Reference amount, normalization basis and collection denominator agree in both languages. Before burden allocation verify whole-mass and elemental C/H/O conservation, energy reconciliation and separate reaction-aware H2O/reactive-component ledgers under wood_water_carbon. Require actual formulation, cure/oxidation extent, air/oxygen/humidity, retained product/residue and exhaust composition with uncertainty, including PF-generated H2O, pMDI-consumed H2O/fossil CO2 and actual combustion products. Reject external-only H2O/dry-resin closure, assumed full cure/oxidation, default yields, altered measurements, duplicated reaction products or internal transfers. Unknown formation/consumption or unmatched stage endpoints leave balance completeness unresolved; report residuals against evidenced uncertainty, not a fabricated balancing amount. | usda-wood-handbook-2021; epa-osb-2002; epa-wood-boiler-2022; frihart-joining-2023 |
| v_emissions | p_osb | Include biogenic CO2 and fossil binder/fuel carbon separately. Verify each emission species and medium; never replace sulfur dioxide with sulfur oxides, propanal with propanol, or MDI monomer with polymeric resin. Speciate remaining identified organics as additional atomic rows; a VOC total is a closure diagnostic, not added to its species. | epa-osb-2002; corrim-osb-us-2025 |
| v_scope_extension | p_osb | Add each actual unlisted fuel, chemical, refrigerant, packaging component, wastewater outlet pollutant or exported heat as a separate exact exchange with a collection protocol. Different binder/treatment/overlay variants require applicability review. No unexamined cut-off based on small mass. | epa-osb-2002 |
| v_case_limits | p_osb | CORRIM is a 23-facility US 2022/2023 survey (report submitted 2025-03-21, edited 2025-07-22). Its numeric density, moisture, fuel mix, adhesive rates, yields and allocation percentages are not defaults. Resolve its repeated PM labels and conflicting by-product percentage/species labels against primary records before numerical use. | corrim-osb-us-2025 |

| required_metadata | All reference qualifiers, linked foreground protocols, stage ownership, supplier background scope, physical and burden ledgers, allocation and uncertainty |
| required_quality_disclosure | Actual temporal/geographic/grade coverage, identity/measurement gaps, emission method and limits; no publication or scientific-review claim |
| update_trigger | Changed product grade/recipe, strand geometry/orientation, moisture/thickness/density, gate, supplier, energy/abatement route or new primary evidence |
