# Cut-to-drawing and resealed unframed phenolic-film birch concrete formwork panels

## 1. Scope and Applicability

This PCR covers one new, unframed formwork facing product: receive purchased cured all-birch all-veneer PF-bonded plywood with smooth phenolic film on both faces; cut the contour and drill where required by a specific concrete-form drawing; brush compatible waterborne acrylic paint over every exposed cut and hole; ambient dry, inspect and pack for factory delivery. It is a concrete-contact facing panel, not a complete load-bearing formwork system. Drawing, order and acceptance evidence must establish intended shuttering use and actual fabrication; relabelling stock plywood is insufficient. See `wisa-formwork-2020`, `metsa-formwork-manual`, `metsa-overlaid-epd-2024`.

Excluded: log-to-plywood manufacture, new on-site film application/hot pressing, ordinary unworked stock-sheet sales, other species/core structures, other film or edge-paint routes, scarf-jointed sheets, face-film refurbishment, support/frame assembly, supplied fastening hardware, installation, each pour/use, stripping, cleaning, repair, loss and end-of-life. Purchased bond and film production remain in matched upstream board data, not zero burdens. New film application and hardware-containing components need an explicit method extension, not omitted exchanges. No default concrete-contact service area, structural system or number of pours is specified; use service requires a separately measured reference and service ledger.

## 3. Reference Flow

| Field | Value |
| --- | --- |
| What | Provide a concrete-contact facing fabricated to a shuttering drawing |
| How much | 1 kg accepted delivered net panel at measured retained-water state |
| How well | Declare contour/hole layout, thickness, tolerances, surface condition and acceptance requirements; applicability is not complete-system load certification |
| How long or cycle | One manufacture-to-factory-delivery cycle; no assumed life or reuse per pour |
| reference_flow_link | finished_panel |

| Field | Value |

| Reference amount | 1 |
| Reference product flow | Shuttering for concrete constructional work made out of wood `0c63533f-7bd2-4d58-a0cb-03a1bed26179` |
| Reference flow property | Mass `93a60a56-a3c8-11da-a746-0800200b9a66` |

| Required qualifiers | Birch species and all-veneer layup; PF bond and smooth double phenolic film; received/delivered film/edge-seal states; order and shuttering drawing/contour/hole layout; thickness/tolerance/surface acceptance; net mass and moisture method; waterborne acrylic paint TDS/SDS/solids/volatiles; voltage/location/period/loss boundary; manufacturing scope and waste/air outlet destinations; packaging and attribution; no frame/hardware and no use-service declaration |

Declare every required qualifier in data-package metadata, product or process descriptions. Net mass includes retained bond, film, paint and water, excludes transport packaging; 1 kg does not establish functional equivalence across geometries or support systems.

## 4. Measurement and Unit Rules

| rule_id | Applies to | Required property | Required unit | Rule |
| --- | --- | --- | --- | --- |
| reference_mass | reference product | Mass `93a60a56-a3c8-11da-a746-0800200b9a66` | kg | Weigh accepted delivered net panel using cp_product; all inventory uses per 1 kg reference flow. Reject gross packaging mass, oven-dry wood mass or theoretical density substitutes. |
| coated_moisture | coated_board; finished_panel; coated_offcut; captured_dust | Mass | kg | Validate the coated/bonded matrix water method with cp_material/cp_product; drying mass loss may contain paint/bond volatiles, not only water. For unglued wood MC=100×water mass/oven-dry wood mass (usda-wood-handbook-2021); no default species density conversion. |
| electricity_basis | electricity | Net calorific value `93a60a56-a3c8-11da-a746-0800200c9a66` | MJ | Use cp_energy; 1 kWh = 3.6 MJ. State that the platform Net calorific value property carries electrical energy; match consumer-side low-voltage delivery, supplier and loss basis; unknown bases leave provider linkage pending. |
| wet_paint_basis | edge_paint; waste_paint; washwater | Mass | kg | Record whole-formulation wet paint; cp_coating separates dry solids, formulation water, volatile constituents and additional water. Waterborne is not emission-free; solids, density and volatility require measurement or supplier evidence. |
| particle_partition | pm25; pmcoarse; pmover10 | Mass | kg | For the same outlet, period and method PM2.5, PM10 and total filterable PM are nested; only comparable measurements permit coarse=PM10−PM2.5 and over10=total PM−PM10. Negative differences or incompatible tests must not be clamped to zero or assigned assumed fractions. |

## 5. System Boundary

### Boundary Abstraction

| Field | Value |
| --- | --- |
| declared_starting_condition | Receipt of purchased cured double-film all-birch all-veneer PF plywood with original edge seal and auxiliaries; upstream operations not repeated in this foreground |
| starting_condition_role | Manufacturing receiving cutoff; not a burden-free input |
| product_classification_scope | Drawing-specific unframed formwork-facing subset of CPC 31623; no mapping claim for stock plywood or other shuttering products |
| recursive_input_rule | No purchased finished shuttering for refurbishment in this route. Same-batch internal rework uses equal-quantity internal links, without another purchase/manufacturing burden; purchased fabricated/used shuttering requires a method extension. |
| upstream_dataset_requirement | Match board wood/PF/double-film/original-edge-seal state, auxiliary production, electricity, tap water, inbound transport and external waste treatment. Uncoated board alone cannot complete coated-board data; do not add already-included film or transport again. |
| disclosure | Disclose site, survey period, route/states, manufacturing/transport delivery cutoffs, providers/destinations, pending backgrounds, measurement completeness and exclusion of use service. |

| rule_id | applies_to | rule | source_ids |
| --- | --- | --- | --- |
| boundary_actual_route | manufacturing | Include receiving, cutting, conditional drilling, dust collection, brushing exposed edges/holes, ambient drying ventilation, inspection, packing, electric handling and production-period equipment maintenance. Existing film is upstream; no new on-site film, hot press or combustion. | wisa-formwork-2020; metsa-formwork-manual; metsa-overlaid-epd-2024 |
| boundary_one_unit | manufacturing | Aggregate machining, sealing and packing as one foreground unit with one delivered finished output. Retain stage physical measurements/loops; both ends of each internal transfer have equal quantity, lot and state, not another external product exchange. | wisa-formwork-2020 |
| boundary_releases | manufacturing | Separate captured dust from actual outdoor releases. Brush washwater and residual paint go to external treatment, without assumed direct water discharge or on-site incineration; actual such routes require method/species extension. Do not duplicate background electricity emissions as on-site emissions. | epa-sawmill-pm-2014 |
| boundary_fasteners | finished_panel | Unframed panel delivery has no supplied screws, nails, clamps or supports; installation hardware belongs to a separate construction service. If hardware is actually supplied, do not silently exclude it: this scope is unavailable. | wisa-formwork-2020; metsa-formwork-manual |
| boundary_use_service | dataset | This manufacturing PCR explicitly excludes reuse service. A service extension independently measures contact area and accepted pours, panel-specific turns/retirement, replacement/loss, repair materials, cleaning water/energy/effluent, release agents, installation hardware and handling. Attribute manufacturing once across measured service, without buying/manufacturing a full panel again each pour; manufacturer reuse figures and building life are not defaults. | wisa-formwork-2020; metsa-formwork-manual; metsa-overlaid-epd-2024 |

## 6. Process Inventory Structure

### Process Map

| process_id | process_name | inclusion | inclusion_condition | role | quantitative_reference |
| --- | --- | --- | --- | --- | --- |
| manufacturing | Fabrication, edge resealing and delivery packing | required | declared purchased coated-board route | foreground production | 1 kg net finished reference panel |

Physical map: received coated board → drawing-specific cut/drill → dust removal → brush edge/hole paint → ambient dry → inspect/rework → pack/deliver. Keep separate generation-point ledgers for offcut, captured dust, residual paint, washwater and packaging waste. Same-panel stage transfer and internal rework are not duplicate inputs/outputs. Preserve stage mass/water/wood-biogenic-carbon/bond-film-paint-fossil-carbon balances separately from attributed environmental burdens. Each following card is one atomic exchange; conditional absence needs survey evidence, missing is not zero. Additional actual chemicals, packaging or pollutants require separate verified rows, not inclusion in another flow.

#### Inputs

##### Product flows

###### Plywood consisting solely of sheets, with at least one outer ply of non-coniferous wood other than tropical (`coated_board`)

Purchased all-birch, all-veneer PF-bonded board with cured smooth phenolic film on both faces and original acrylic edge seal. Record actual layup, film loading/state, moisture and net received mass. This general plywood identity contains the target subset; it supplies no coated-board recipe, amount or background. An uncoated plywood dataset alone leaves the film/initial edge-seal upstream gap unresolved.

- Selected flow: Plywood consisting solely of sheets, with at least one outer ply of non-coniferous wood other than tropical `897daeae-8210-4a8e-af21-7ad112411dc5`

- Sources: `metsa-overlaid-epd-2024`

###### Water-Based Paint (`edge_paint`)

Whole wet waterborne acrylic edge paint, brush-applied to exposed cuts and holes, compatible with purchased film and cured at ambient conditions. Require supplier TDS/SDS and recipe; no UV cure, solvent-borne varnish or assumed solids/VOC factor. Wider binder examples in this identity do not authorize alkyd substitution or its generic emission claims. Its CPC 35120 placement describes artists' colours and related tints, an unresolved source-classification inconsistency with the broad waterborne-paint definition; it does not verify industrial edge-paint suitability. Retain the specified whole acrylic waterborne paint only with actual application, formulation/state and supplier/provider compatibility evidence; do not rewrite the source classification or infer a certified grade.

###### Alternating current (`electricity`)

Low-voltage (<1 kV) consumer-side AC grid supply for cutting, drilling, dust extraction, ambient drying ventilation, electric handling and packing. The selected identity is CN supply; require actual voltage, location/year/mix and supplier loss boundary. Different receiving voltages/geographies need a verified compatible identity/background extension; supplier linkage remains pending until evidenced. Net calorific value is the database reference property; for electricity it carries electrical MJ, not combustion heat.

## 7. Allocation and Co-product Handling

| rule_id | applies_to | rule | source_ids |
| --- | --- | --- | --- |
| allocation_subdivision | manufacturing | Prefer dedicated batch measurements, submeters or equipment-time attribution backed by measured causal relationships; include standby/control loads. Retain site totals, physical and burden ledgers; attribution shares sum to one, never multiply physical coproduct outputs by burden shares to manufacture a balance. |  |
| allocation_waste | coated_offcut; captured_dust; waste_paint; washwater | Accepted panels are the only manufacturing reference in this route; waste-treatment burdens belong to production. Scrap sale alone does not establish an independent coproduct; no default negative burden, recycling or fuel-substitution credit. Internal rework reduces only actual new-material demand; do not repeat prior manufacture. | metsa-overlaid-epd-2024 |
| allocation_extension | dataset | Actual independent coproducts, shared other routes or reuse services require disclosed independent measurements, subdivision or justified physical/economic methods and sensitivity; unresolved choices preclude a complete dataset, and softwood survey shares cannot be transplanted. |  |

## 8. Foreground Data Collection, Calculation, and Quality Rules

### Data Collection Protocols

| protocol_id | process_id | flow_role | record_type | raw_fields | collection_method | unit | frequency | temporal_coverage | site_scope | aggregation_rule | quality_evidence |

Drying loss is vapour only after confirming water identity. | kg; m3; density; temperature | each batch and relevant event | same declared continuous production period; retain dates and abnormal intervals | same factory and order route | per 1 kg reference flow | calibration, supplier evidence, lot records, anomalies/uncertainty and closure residuals |
| cp_pack | manufacturing | pe_wrap; pp_strap; wood_pallet | packaging BOM/weighing/return ledger | each packaging material/net mass; pack/pallet specification; batch issues/returns/stocks; actual retention/loss/repair; background inclusions | Weigh each material separately; reconcile shipped packaging and actual pallet returns, check whether upstream already contains containers/packaging; no assumed reuse allocation. | kg; count | each batch and relevant event | same declared continuous production period; retain dates and abnormal intervals | same factory and order route | per 1 kg reference flow | calibration, supplier evidence, lot records, anomalies/uncertainty and closure residuals |

All protocols retain absolute batch/event records, aggregate the attributable inventory-adjusted totals over the same accepted delivered net-panel kg cohort, and report per 1 kg reference flow using calc_normalize. Never average batch ratios or divide by panel count/pours. cp_product establishes that same net-mass denominator; its final reference amount is 1 kg.

### Calculation Rules

| rule_id | Applies to | Formula or rule | Inputs | Output | source_ids |
| --- | --- | --- | --- | --- | --- |
| calc_normalize | all inventory rows | x_i = attributable inventory-adjusted exchange total / Q; Q is same-cohort accepted delivered net panel kg from cp_product; finished reference output is 1 kg. Match stocks/WIP to cohorts, never normalize by pours. | cp_product; all row collection protocols | inventory per 1 kg reference flow |  |
| calc_electricity | electricity | Electricity MJ=measured kWh×3.6; establish attribution and meter boundary first, retain raw kWh. | cp_energy | MJ |  |
| calc_paint | edge_paint; waste_paint; washwater; water_vapour; butoxyethanol | Whole wet-paint consumption=issued−returned−stock increase; wet paint=retained solids/water/volatiles+waste+air+equipment-stock change, with measured constituent partitions and extra water separate. Unknown volatilization is not all water or VOC. | cp_coating; cp_water; cp_air; cp_waste | wet-paint component ledger | wisa-formwork-2020 |
| calc_physical_balance | manufacturing | Received+opening stocks=accepted shipments+each waste+actual air+closing stocks; reconcile dry wood, bond/film/paint solids and water separately; equal-quantity internal loops cancel. Packaging and equipment oil have separate subledgers, not panel mass. | cp_material; cp_coating; cp_product; cp_water; cp_waste; cp_pack; cp_maintenance; cp_air | absolute physical ledger and residuals | usda-wood-handbook-2021 |
| calc_particles | pm25; pmcoarse; pmover10 | Same-method/outlet bins are PM2.5, PM10−PM2.5 and total filterable PM−PM10, summed once; separate captured dust, keep negative differences/unknown size/condensable-method mismatch pending. | cp_air; cp_waste | disjoint particle masses | epa-sawmill-pm-2014 |
| calc_air_mass | formaldehyde; butoxyethanol | Actual emitted mass=concentration×gas volume on matching standard states, integrated over actual operation and converted to kg; validated site constituent balance provides independent reconciliation. Chamber ppm or worker exposure is not factory kg. | cp_air; cp_coating | actual outdoor species mass | metsa-overlaid-epd-2024 |
| calc_carbon | co2_bio | Input biogenic carbon=product+waste+actual air+stock-change biogenic carbon, with a separate fossil-carbon ledger. Only evidenced oxidized wood carbon uses the CO2/C molar-mass ratio; resin/film/paint are not assumed biogenic, and CO2 remains in LCI. | cp_carbon; cp_product; cp_waste; cp_air | biogenic/fossil carbon ledger | metsa-overlaid-epd-2024 |
| calc_transport | road_freight | Actual leg kg*km=wet transported kg×measured leg km; convert original t*km with 1 t*km=1000 kg*km, then divide by same-cohort accepted net product kg. Match return/payload boundary to carrier background without an additional assumed empty-return burden. | cp_transport; cp_product | road-freight mass-distance per 1 kg reference flow |  |

### Data Quality Requirements

| requirement_id | Applies to | Requirement | Evidence |
| --- | --- | --- | --- |
| dq_scope | dataset | Establish scope with order/drawing, supplier board/paint evidence and actual route. Unknown recipe, film burden, compartment or supplier basis is a specific pending gap; identity success is not a complete dataset. | cp_product; cp_material; cp_coating; cp_energy |
| dq_period | all inventory rows | All flows match site/period/cohort of the product denominator; retain stocks, rework, rejects and abnormal intervals. Multi-site/period results use total attributable amounts/total net output, not simple ratio means. | all collection protocols |
| dq_complete | all inventory rows | No universal consumption/emission factor; distinguish measured, not applicable, below detection and unmeasured. Unknown UUIDs, supply chains and destinations persist explicitly, with uncertainty/completeness disclosure. | calibration; records; supplier declarations; outlet tests |

## 9. Validation Rules

| rule_id | applies_to | rule | source_ids |
| --- | --- | --- | --- |
| validation_identity | dataset | Confirm distinct purchased-board and drawing-fabricated finished states and finished_panel as the sole reference output; verify birch/all-veneer/PF/double-film, actual fabrication, edge/hole reseal and no frame/supplied hardware. Stock-sheet sale or service is unavailable. | wisa-formwork-2020; metsa-overlaid-epd-2024 |
| validation_measurement | all inventory rows | Check one accepted net-mass denominator, formulation water/solids/volatiles, absolute physical balance and attributed burden ledger. Reference is not uses; unsupported measurement, unexplained residual or unknown bases cannot be reported passing. | usda-wood-handbook-2021 |
| validation_emissions | pm25; pmcoarse; pmover10; formaldehyde; butoxyethanol; co2_bio | Check air compartment/species/CAS/biogenic-fossil source and actual quantity definition; particle bins do not overlap and capture differs from emission. No nearby species or correction substitutes; unknown fractions, gas standard, size or detection limits leave affected conclusions pending. | epa-sawmill-pm-2014 |
| validation_background | dataset | Verify complete flow identity route/reference property/unit chain and provider quantity/state/location/period/packaging/included manufacture or transport. Blank UUIDs and pending providers are unresolved; uncoated board, briquettes, clean sawdust, mining wastewater or high-voltage production electricity cannot replace the respective exchanges. | metsa-overlaid-epd-2024 |
| validation_service | dataset | Manufacturing result supports net panel delivery only; without independently measured turns/repair/loss/cleaning/release agent and once-only manufacturing attribution, it cannot claim per-pour or multi-use formwork service. Scientific review and mapping acceptance are separate. | wisa-formwork-2020; metsa-formwork-manual |

## 10. Published Dataset Profile

| Field | Value |
| --- | --- |
| dataset_role | foreground production dataset |
| downstream_use | secondary_dataset; background_dataset |
| allowed_use | Same-route drawing-specific unframed panel manufacture after qualifiers/background matching and completeness disclosure; an isolated fabrication unit may be supplied with explicit disclosure that it is not complete cradle-to-gate. |
| excluded_use | Integrated substrate manufacture, other woods/coatings/systems, per-pour/multi-use service, support-load performance claims, automatic methodology approval or mapping acceptance |
| required_metadata | PCR id/version; drawing/material/PF/film/edge/net-mass/moisture; site/period/voltage/supply-chain/boundary/protocol/attribution/destinations/non-applicability; all pending identity/quantity links |
| required_quality_disclosure | Method not independently scientifically reviewed; measured coverage/skips/detection limits, samples/uncertainty, stock closure/residuals, unresolved UUIDs/background applicability; no false completeness |
| update_trigger | Change in supplier board/film/PF/paint, geometry/machining, drying/energy/packaging, waste treatment, provider voltage/location/period or boundary |
