# Factory-prefinished UF-bonded all-hardwood-veneer assembled flooring panels

## 1. Scope and Applicability

This PCR covers factory-assembled, cross-laminated all-wood flooring panels made from purchased dry non-tropical hardwood veneer sheets, each no thicker than 6 mm, bonded with urea-formaldehyde (UF) adhesive, machined into installable profiles, clear UV-prefinished and packaged for sale. Face/wear layer, each core species and balancing back layer remain separate material records. This is a manufacturing category with one measured reference mass, not a claim of installed service equivalence.

Single-layer solid-wood assembled parquet has no cross-laminated wood support; HDF decorative laminate has a printed wear image; wood-faced HDF composite has real wood on a composite core; unassembled strips have not become panels. None is covered. Also excluded are bamboo, tropical/softwood plies, lumber/particleboard/fibreboard cores, different glue chemistry, pigmented stains, jobsite finishing, and integrated log-to-veneer manufacture. Purchased veneer production stays in upstream datasets. The selected route uses electrical handling and externally linked heat, without foreground fuel combustion. A site with an integrated boiler must link a separately measured boiler unit and retain its fuel, ash and all elementary emissions rather than treat it as an unmeasured utility.

The distinction between solid and all-wood engineered flooring follows `nwfa-wood-definition`; assembly follows `unsd-cpc-31626`; veneer lay-up, pressing, machining, UV operations and boxing are documented in `corrim-flooring-2011`, sections 2.5–2.6 and 3.6–3.9. That source is an Eastern US 2007 manufacturing survey, not a current global parameter set. Its mixed UF/PVA recipe, densities, moisture targets, coating loadings, proxies, emission factors and carbon-neutral interpretation are not PCR defaults.

| market_state | Accepted, fully cured, factory finished and packed; flooring net mass excludes package |

## 3. Reference Flow

| Field | Value |
| --- | --- |
| What | Manufacturing supply of assembled wood floor covering |
| How much | 1 kg accepted flooring net mass at factory gate; effective coverable area is measured as a supplementary product descriptor |
| How well | Declared layer species, thickness, profile, glue and coating recipe, delivery moisture, curing and product acceptance criteria |
| How long or cycle | One manufacturing supply event; no assumed service life, resurfacing cycle or installation loss |
| reference_flow_link | reference_output |

| Field | Value |
| --- | --- |
| Reference amount | 1 |
| Reference product flow | Assembled flooring panels made out of wood `a68f3cc0-8df3-4e20-8793-599f95e254a2` |
| Reference flow property | Mass `93a60a56-a3c8-11da-a746-0800200b9a66` |
| Reference unit group | Units of mass `93a60a57-a4c8-11da-a746-0800200c9a66` |
| Reference unit | kg |
| Required qualifiers | Species and source for each wood layer; thickness of each layer and total; grain arrangement and bond line; UF formulation, supplied solids/water and evidenced cure extent; clear UV coating SKU and chemistry per stage; retained coating/additive mass; measured cover dimensions and joining profile; moisture measurement basis; net mass; factory gate; metered voltage; heat supply definition; acceptance grade/date |

Required qualifiers must be declared in each foreground package. The broad reference identity is restricted by these qualifiers; it does not authorize use for solid parquet or HDF laminate. Manufacturing mass is not an installed-area functional unit.

## 4. Measurement and Unit Rules

| rule_id | Applies to | Required property | Required unit | Rule |
| --- | --- | --- | --- | --- |
| reference_mass | reference product | Mass `93a60a56-a3c8-11da-a746-0800200b9a66` | kg | Weigh accepted finished flooring on a calibrated scale at declared moisture; subtract all package tare and reject mass. Denominator G is total accepted net flooring mass in the matched production period; no default product weight. |
| effective_area | reference product | Area | m2 | Measure a representative joined layout of accepted boards with actual joint engagement. Count only exposed coverable face, excluding tongue overlap, concealed edges and package nominal oversize. Reconcile a = A/G with thickness and measured mass; do not assume installation cutting waste. |
| wood_moisture | wood layers | Mass | kg | Use dry-basis moisture u = (wet wood mass - dry wood mass) / dry wood mass. Measure separate wood layers with a species-calibrated method verified against representative oven-dry samples; do not treat resin/coating volatilization as water. No default moisture or density. Supplied resin nonvolatile solids and cured retained solids are distinct measured states, not a universally conserved component; use layer_balance for reaction-aware reconciliation. |
| utility_basis | electricity; press_heat | Net calorific value `93a60a56-a3c8-11da-a746-0800200c9a66`; Gross calorific value `93a60a56-a3c8-14da-a746-0800200c9a66` | MJ | Electricity has the recorded NCV property; convert metered kWh using 3.6 MJ/kWh. Steam heat has a GCV identity and requires supplier-defined reference-energy compatibility; a bare MJ value cannot establish net useful heat. |

## 5. System Boundary

### Boundary Abstraction

| Field | Value |
| --- | --- |
| declared_starting_condition | Dry separate non-tropical hardwood veneer at flooring factory receiving gate; resin and coating preparations received as declared formulations |
| starting_condition_role | Foreground gate-to-gate assembly/finishing plus explicit upstream product, utility, transport and waste-treatment links for cradle-to-gate use |
| product_classification_scope | Only the specified multilayer assembled wood subset of CPC 3.0 31626 |
| recursive_input_rule | Purchased assembled floor panels or recovered same-category material terminate tracing at a documented upstream dataset; disclose identity, previous processing and amount. Rework within this unit is internal WIP, not a new external reference product. |
| upstream_dataset_requirement | Matched species/veneer drying/peeling, resin solids, coating formulation, grid region/year/voltage, thermal supplier reference and actual treatment; missing compatibility remains pending |
| disclosure | Gate, period, configurations, starting moisture, purchased/on-site split, WIP/stock changes, heat generation boundary, losses and excluded downstream scenarios |

### Boundary Rules

| rule_id | Rule | source_ids |
| --- | --- | --- |
| boundary_stages | Include conditioning, glue preparation, lay-up/press cure, machining, dust collection, all clear-coating operations/UV cure, QC, electrical material handling and packing. Collect each stage independently, then aggregate one foreground unit; WIP handoffs retain equal physical quantities on both stage ledgers. | corrim-flooring-2011 |
| boundary_upstream | Link upstream veneer, adhesive/coating, utilities and actual waste treatment once. Separate utility generation prevents duplicated boiler emissions; site integration does not justify dropping fuel emissions or ash. Retain biogenic CO2 in any linked combustion LCI irrespective of climate accounting treatment. | corrim-flooring-2011 |
| boundary_downstream | Installation, underlay/installation adhesive, actual cutting loss, use, repair, replacement and end of life require a separately evidenced scenario. No lifetime or installation loss multiplier is supplied by this manufacturing PCR. Do not omit low-mass resins/coatings because of mass alone. | corrim-flooring-2011; nwfa-wood-definition |

## 6. Process Inventory Structure

### Process: Assembly, machining, clear UV cure and packing (`flooring`)

All flow amounts refer to the same accepted output mass G and matched period. A conditional row uses measured presence or documented absence; no row is a positive default emission. Each purchased formulated SKU is one exchange; chemicals separately dosed on site are separate exchanges. Additional species, formulations, wastes or identified emissions require further atomic rows before dataset completion.

This is a separate uf glue exchange at the flooring-unit boundary; collect it under the stated route and measurement conditions.

- Selected flow: Urea-formaldehyde resin `23e41b7b-0991-4cf7-8625-7a30d23bbb27`
- Flow property / unit: Mass / kg
- Amount rule: Use this generic UF-resin row only for a real independently supplied resin state and mass reference supported by its native identity and actual provider; record supplied resin mass, measured solids/moisture and actual onsite mixing/application. A bought complete prepared aqueous or compounded UF adhesive requires one specific compatible complete-formulation supply row and provider retaining supplier resin manufacture, formulation preparation and delivery before use; the generic resin UUID alone does not establish that complete supply. Its included resin, catalyst, carrier water and additives are analytical composition, not new external purchases. Actual independently purchased additions and onsite dilution/mixing water, utilities and losses remain separate. Preserve supplier wet/active reference correspondence; never equate whole wet preparation kg to dry-resin kg or count included water twice. No default solids fraction. Retain actual supplied precondensation state, recipe and cure-extent evidence under cp_recipe; supplied solids do not automatically equal cured retained resin mass.
- Value mode: Foreground record (`foreground_record`)
- Specificity: Site-specific (`site_specific`)
- Normalization basis: per 1 kg reference flow
- Basis kind: Reference flow (`reference_flow`)
- Evidence kind: Collected record (`collected_record`)
- Collection protocol: `cp_recipe`
- Sources: `corrim-flooring-2011`

###### glue hardener (`glue_hardener`)

This is a separate ammonium-chloride glue hardener exchange at the flooring-unit boundary; collect it under the stated route and measurement conditions. The candidate chemical name, CAS and crystalline-salt description are coherent, but its absorption-tower/chemical-treatment interface does not establish the actual delivered solid catalyst supply. Keep this concrete Mass/kg row and protocol with its UUID unresolved until positive supplier/interface correspondence or another compatible identity is verified; do not infer a replacement, actual dose or verified provider.

- Selected flow: Ammonium Chloride
- Flow property / unit: Mass / kg
- Amount rule: Only when ammonium chloride is separately dosed: weigh pure salt, record concentration/purity and mixing losses; embedded catalyst in purchased adhesive is not a duplicate input. Absent dosing requires evidence of absence.
- Value mode: Foreground record (`foreground_record`)
- Specificity: Site-specific (`site_specific`)
- Normalization basis: per 1 kg reference flow
- Basis kind: Reference flow (`reference_flow`)
- Evidence kind: Collected record (`collected_record`)
- Collection protocol: `cp_recipe`
- Sources: `corrim-flooring-2011`

- Flow property / unit: Net calorific value / MJ
- Amount rule: Sum attributable metered kWh for conditioning, glue spreading, pressing, sawing, sanding, profiling, UV lamps, extraction, electric handling and packing; convert to MJ with 1 kWh = 3.6 MJ. Use only a verified 1-35 kV user-side supply and separate measured transformer losses; no duplicate stage totals.
- Value mode: Foreground record (`foreground_record`)
- Specificity: Site-specific (`site_specific`)
- Normalization basis: per 1 kg reference flow
- Basis kind: Reference flow (`reference_flow`)
- Evidence kind: Collected record (`collected_record`)

- Selected flow: Process heat from steam `fcf9e128-688f-42f0-9dca-85d2319cfac5`
- Flow property / unit: Gross calorific value / MJ
- Amount rule: For supplied industrial-boiler steam heat, record supplier reference definition plus delivered steam mass, pressure, temperature, dryness and condensate return; calculate heat from measured enthalpies only on the supplier-defined basis.

###### alumina (`alumina`)

This is a separate alumina exchange at the flooring-unit boundary; collect it under the stated route and measurement conditions. The native Al2O3 Product/Mass locator is classified as CPC 41432, expressly excluding artificial corundum; chemistry alone does not establish the actual coating particle grade, form, production route or supplier compatibility. This UUID cannot cover an actual artificial-corundum addition, including fused corundum if present. Such actual material requires a separately verified physical flow before binding, not renaming it generic alumina. Preserve the measured whole separate addition and avoid double counting alumina already embodied in purchased topcoat.

This is a separate freight exchange at the flooring-unit boundary; collect it under the stated route and measurement conditions.

- Selected flow: Inbound diesel road-freight service
- Flow property / unit: Mass*distance / t*km

- Flow property / unit: Mass / kg
- Amount rule: Weigh separately collected actual non-agglomerated solid UF-bonded panel offcuts and rejected panels; document wood/adhesive state, moisture, coating contamination, destination and waste status. Confirm that physical state and recipient/provider acceptance before treatment linkage; a broad offcut identity does not establish matching treatment. Unglued veneer rejects are a different stream and must be split when present. Retain physical output mass before environmental allocation.

## 7. Allocation and Co-product Handling

| rule_id | Rule | source_ids |
| --- | --- | --- |
| allocation_physical | Keep the physical wood/water/carbon ledger and the allocated environmental burden ledger separately. Accepted floor panels, WIP changes, offcuts, captured dust and external wastes keep their full measured quantities. Never multiply co-product physical output by an allocation share. | corrim-flooring-2011 |
| allocation_subdivide | First use stage metering/subdivision for avoidable joint burdens. External waste disposal with no saleable product is not a co-product allocation denominator. Internal recovered solvent, heat and rework stay internal and receive no external substitution credit. | corrim-flooring-2011 |
| allocation_joint | For demonstrated saleable wood co-products with similar wood material, disclose a dry-wood-mass allocation of remaining inseparable wood-conversion burdens using measured moisture-corrected masses; report sensitivity where prices or contamination invalidate that physical relation. UF/coating/finishing-specific burdens follow their measured consumption and destinations, not all wood outputs automatically. Document shares summing to one and a separate allocated dataset view. | corrim-flooring-2011 |

## 8. Foreground Data Collection, Calculation, and Quality Rules

### Data Collection Protocols

| protocol_id | process_id | flow_role | record_type | raw_fields | collection_method | unit | frequency | temporal_coverage | site_scope | aggregation_rule | quality_evidence |
| --- | --- | --- | --- | --- | --- | --- | --- | --- | --- | --- | --- |
| cp_output | flooring | Accepted output geometry and mass | primary measurement and records | lot; accepted/rejected counts; package tare; net finished mass G; moisture; effective joint width/length; joined-layout area A; total/layer thickness; grade/date; WIP stock | Calibrated scale, calipers and joined-layout survey on the same representative lot; do not derive G from nominal density. | kg; m2; mm | Each lot/shift; continuous meters; representative emission campaign | One matched full production period covering route/product variability | One facility and one declared recipe/configuration | per 1 kg reference flow | Calibration; raw records; matched stocks; uncertainty and absence evidence |
| cp_layers | flooring | Separate wood layers | primary measurement and records | species and botanical group; supplier; layer position; grain; dry veneer thickness; issue/return/reject weights; wet/dry sample masses; moisture calibration; start/end stocks | Weigh each species/layer supply independently; matched wood-only oven-dry samples establish dry-basis moisture; final composite method must account for resin/coating volatiles. | kg; mm | Each lot/shift; continuous meters; representative emission campaign | One matched full production period covering route/product variability | One facility and one declared recipe/configuration | per 1 kg reference flow | Calibration; raw records; matched stocks; uncertainty and absence evidence |
| cp_recipe | flooring | Glue and each coating/cleaner chemical | primary measurement and records | SKU; SDS; supplier formulation and supplied precondensation state; wet mass; nonvolatile-solids test basis; water/solvent fractions; dose; issue; return; retained cured glue/coating; residual reactive species; catalyst/additive; cleaning recovery; stage opening/closing stocks and paired handoffs; cure schedule; measured cure extent and method; formation/consumption evidence; sampling and uncertainty; QC | Calibrated weighing and issue/return/stock balances for each actual SKU; pair stage endpoints with moisture/composition measured on compatible bases. Retain press temperature/time/pressure and UV lamp dose/speed; establish actual cure extent and retained composition by validated representative analysis or supplier/site evidence, not acceptance alone. Quantify reaction terms only from actual recipe/extent with uncertainty; unavailable terms remain pending, never zero or default yield. Verify each actual independent UF-resin supply versus a bought whole prepared adhesive: complete formulations require specific compatible complete-product identities/providers and supplier manufacture/preparation/delivery once; included ingredients/carrier water remain analytical. Record true separately purchased additions and actual onsite dilution/mixing water/utilities/losses separately, with matched provider wet/active reference basis; unresolved whole identities remain pending, never recaption a constituent UUID. | kg | Each lot/shift; continuous meters; representative emission campaign | One matched full production period covering route/product variability | One facility and one declared recipe/configuration | per 1 kg reference flow | Calibration; raw records; matched stocks; uncertainty and absence evidence |
| cp_energy | flooring | Stage electricity and steam heat | primary measurement and records | stage; kWh; meter; voltage; grid/period; transformer boundary; steam/return mass; pressure; temperature; dryness; enthalpy reference; supplier energy definition | Submeter or auditable run-time metering allocation for press, machining, UV, extraction and packing; meter supply/return and reconcile enthalpy with supplier reference. Unknown definition blocks thermal background linkage. | MJ | Each lot/shift; continuous meters; representative emission campaign | One matched full production period covering route/product variability | One facility and one declared recipe/configuration | per 1 kg reference flow | Calibration; raw records; matched stocks; uncertainty and absence evidence |
| cp_packaging | flooring | Each packaging component | primary measurement and records | box/film SKU; issue/return weights; package counts; tare; scrap; outgoing material; fibre/polymer grade | Weigh components separately and reconcile purchase, stores, packed product and damaged material; no standard scrap fraction. | kg | Each lot/shift; continuous meters; representative emission campaign | One matched full production period covering route/product variability | One facility and one declared recipe/configuration | per 1 kg reference flow | Calibration; raw records; matched stocks; uncertainty and absence evidence |
| cp_waste | flooring | Each waste stream | primary measurement and records | origin stage; material chemistry; wet/dry mass; moisture; resin/coating fraction; retained/recovered quantity; destination; sale status; treatment manifest; storage change | Separate weighed containers/weighbridge and analytical liquid sampling; distinguish raw-wood dust, bonded dust, glue, coating, solvent, aqueous effluent and cardboard. Preserve full pre-allocation masses. | kg | Each lot/shift; continuous meters; representative emission campaign | One matched full production period covering route/product variability | One facility and one declared recipe/configuration | per 1 kg reference flow | Calibration; raw records; matched stocks; uncertainty and absence evidence |
| cp_air | flooring | Each released species/particle bin | primary measurement and records | source; controls; species/CAS; sample time; concentration; gas flow; pressure/temperature; wet/dry gas basis; inlet/background humidity; operating hours; detection limits; PM cutpoints; matched wood/carrier-water and solvent stocks/outlets; actual recipe/cure extent; evidenced species formation/consumption; sampling and uncertainty | Matched stack/fugitive monitoring after controls, net of inlet/background contributions, or a site-specific validated species balance under layer_balance where monitoring is unavailable. Separate initial/carrier water from reaction water and retained/recovered/liquid outlets. Do not assign reaction yields from qualitative chemistry or unexplained mass loss. Distinguish absence, below detection and unresolved; identify every actual chemical, not one VOC total. | kg | Each lot/shift; continuous meters; representative emission campaign | One matched full production period covering route/product variability | One facility and one declared recipe/configuration | per 1 kg reference flow | Calibration; raw records; matched stocks; uncertainty and absence evidence |
| cp_transport | flooring | Actual incoming road freight | primary measurement and records | shipment material; loaded tonnes; distance; vehicle class; fuel; payload; return; supplier delivered boundary | Shipping records and actual route distances; supplier boundary check prevents duplicated transport. | t*km | Each lot/shift; continuous meters; representative emission campaign | One matched full production period covering route/product variability | One facility and one declared recipe/configuration | per 1 kg reference flow | Calibration; raw records; matched stocks; uncertainty and absence evidence |

Collection aggregation uses accepted net G for every row. Raw period quantities remain in their actual numerator units; the inventory value is the attributed period quantity divided by G, expressed per 1 kg reference flow. Physical outputs stay unallocated in the process map. Report allocated burdens separately.

### Calculation Rules

| rule_id | Applies to | Formula or rule | Inputs | Output | source_ids |
| --- | --- | --- | --- | --- | --- |
| period_normalization | all inventory rows | q = Q / G; Q is attributed matched-period exchange; G is accepted flooring net kg, strictly positive. Keep physical Q and allocation shares separate. | Q; G; cp_output | Exchange per 1 kg reference flow | corrim-flooring-2011 |
| area_reconciliation | reference_output | a = A/G; measured coverable area per kg. t = measured finished thickness in metres. Envelope volume V = A*t; actual profiled solid volume subtracts measured recess/overlap geometry; rho = G/V on the same moisture basis. A package nominal rectangle is not effective cover. | A; G; t; cp_output | m2/kg and geometry/mass check | nwfa-wood-definition |
| layer_balance | flooring | For each pure wood layer, u = (m_wet - m_dry)/m_dry; m_dry = m_wet/(1+u). Reconcile G from measured retained dry wood, cured resin/coating/additives and water in non-overlapping fractions at the accepted state; incoming nonvolatile solids are not automatically retained cured solids. On the same stage boundary/period before allocation, total physical mass obeys opening + inputs = closing + outputs; apply the same conservation separately to each relevant element, including C/H/O/N for UF, using actual compositions and every material outlet. Do not add chemical generation/consumption to total mass or elemental balances, sum energy/freight into mass, or infer carbon from total coated-board mass. For each species s, including H2O and reactive resin/coating constituents, opening_s + inputs_s + formation_s = closing_s + outputs_s + consumption_s. Quantify reaction terms only with actual supplied recipe, cure extent and validated analysis/stoichiometry; include retained material, wastes, condensate and actual air releases once, with paired stage handoffs and stocks. Document nonreactive terms as zero only with evidence. Unknown terms/residuals remain unresolved with propagated uncertainty; never force closure by invented water/emissions or a universal solids yield. | Layer masses; u; retained composition; stocks; actual recipe/cure extent and reaction evidence; cp_output; cp_layers; cp_recipe; cp_waste; cp_air | Separate total-mass, elemental and reaction-aware species residuals with uncertainty | usda-wood-handbook-2021; ding-uf-curing-2020 |
| metered_electricity | electricity | E_MJ = 3.6 * E_kWh; sum mutually exclusive stage readings, reconcile whole-unit meter and remove documented unrelated loads. | kWh; stage meters; cp_energy | MJ per period then per kg | corrim-flooring-2011 |
| thermal_reconciliation | press_heat | H = sum(m_supply*h_supply) - sum(m_return*h_return), with matched enthalpy reference and units plus documented other outlet/heat losses. Use H only if supplier reference is the same delivered-energy basis; do not equate this net balance automatically to a GCV exchange. | Steam/condensate masses; pressure; temperature; dryness; supplier definition; cp_energy | Measured thermal balance and linkage compatibility | corrim-flooring-2011 |
| emission_quantity | formaldehyde; acetone_air; pm25; pmcoarse; pmover10; water_air | Integrate matched mass concentration * gas volume over measured operation, with unit/temperature/pressure/wet-dry conversions, controls and inlet/background subtraction. Particle differences require matched nested samplings; sums include exclusive bins only. Species balances use layer_balance formation/consumption terms supported by actual recipe/cure extent and exclude retained/recovered material and other outlets. Water formation is not itself an air release; unexplained losses or unknown reaction terms cannot establish an emission quantity. No positive factors are supplied. | Monitoring/balance records; cp_air; cp_recipe | Species-specific released mass with uncertainty | corrim-flooring-2011; ding-uf-curing-2020 |

### Data Quality Requirements

| requirement_id | Applies to | Requirement | Evidence |
| --- | --- | --- | --- |
| quality_identity | all inventory rows | Verify full original flow route, material, compartment, property and quantity basis. An identity UUID is not a complete supplier dataset; blank identities and pending basis prevent dependent dataset completion. | Direct flow definition; primary supplier specification |
| quality_balances | flooring | Assess unallocated whole-stream total mass and elemental conservation separately from reaction-aware H2O, resin/coating and solvent species ledgers under layer_balance. Reconcile actual wet/dry test bases, cure extent, all retained/waste/air outlets, paired WIP handoffs and stocks. Propagate measurement, composition and reaction-term uncertainty; investigate residuals without a universal tolerance. Missing reaction evidence prevents dependent species-balance closure/emission estimation; disclose the gap instead of assuming zero formation/consumption or treating supplied dry solids as conserved. | cp_output; cp_layers; cp_recipe; cp_waste; cp_air; actual supplier/site reaction evidence |
| quality_scope | flooring | Use the actual facility period, declared product recipe and supplier region/year. Do not transfer coniferous, paper, optical, wafer or wet-rendering surveys. Unknown, absent and below detection remain distinct. | Production and supplier records; source applicability |

## 9. Validation Rules

| rule_id | Rule | source_ids |
| --- | --- | --- |
| validate_scope | Confirm real wood in every structural ply, individual species/source and thickness, UF bond and clear factory UV finish; reject excluded solid, HDF, strip and alternate-route products. | unsd-cpc-31626; nwfa-wood-definition; corrim-flooring-2011 |
| validate_denominator | Exactly one reference_output of 1 kg accepted net finished flooring. All inventories and collection aggregation use per 1 kg reference flow. Reconcile same-lot effective joined area, measured thickness, net mass and wood moisture; no assumed life or installation waste. | usda-wood-handbook-2021 |
| validate_atomic | Every row is one material/species/formulation/waste/emission. Split physical variants; confirm exact Chinese names and original UUID route/property. Chemical/product tests cannot replace manufacturing emission records. Unknown thermal basis or UUID remains incomplete, not zero. | corrim-flooring-2011 |
| validate_ledgers | Retain complete unallocated total-mass/elemental balances and separately test species ledgers with evidenced formation/consumption under layer_balance. UF cure is a chemical transformation; actual recipe, supplied precondensation state, cure extent, retained composition and uncertainty are required for dependent balances. Do not force H2O or dry-resin closure, equate generated water with discharge, or fill missing evidence with zero/default yields. Preserve matched WIP handoffs, non-overlapping PM bins and all combustion LCI including biogenic CO2 in linked heat datasets; those separately bounded combustion records require actual fuel/air composition and reaction/measurement evidence for their own water-species balances. Background and foreground emissions must not duplicate. Unknown terms leave dependent dataset checks incomplete. | corrim-flooring-2011; usda-wood-handbook-2021; ding-uf-curing-2020 |

## 10. Published Dataset Profile

| Field | Value |
| --- | --- |
| dataset_role | Measured flooring manufacture with explicit upstream links; candidate method does not itself publish a dataset |
| downstream_use | secondary_dataset; background_dataset after independent validation of actual foreground records and pending identities/bases |
| allowed_use | Declared UF/all-hardwood-veneer/clear UV route, manufacturing comparison at matched gate/recipe/quality and moisture |
| excluded_use | Unsupported solid/HDF/strip variants, installed-service equivalence, generic lifespan, assumed cutting losses or emission-free claims |
| required_metadata | All reference qualifiers; facility/period; G and effective A; upstream/treatment links; stage records; stocks; physical and allocated views |
| required_quality_disclosure | Unresolved UUIDs, thermal/recipe background compatibility, sample coverage, uncertainty, missing pollutants and differences from evidence scope |
| update_trigger | Change of layers/species/core/glue/coating, reference geometry/moisture, utility supplier, treatment, measurement coverage or material source evidence |
