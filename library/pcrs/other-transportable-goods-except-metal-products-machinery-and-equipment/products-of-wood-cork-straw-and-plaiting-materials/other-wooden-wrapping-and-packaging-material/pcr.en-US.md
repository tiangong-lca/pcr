# Untreated saw-machined solid wood packaging wedges and contoured blocks



## 1. Scope and Applicability



Applies only to finished loose, untreated solid-wood packaging wedges and contoured/notched blocks, saw-machined from purchased kiln-dried coniferous or temperate hardwood sawnwood by electric equipment. A cargo-contact taper, contour or notch and documented packaging fit acceptance are mandatory. Plain rectangular timber and continuous profiles sold for further manufacture remain upstream categories, even when a buyer later uses them as dunnage. H.A. Stiles documents custom shaped dry pine/poplar packaging components; CTU Code Annex 7 §2.3.5 makes wedge grain direction relevant to cargo restraint. These sources establish physical product/function distinctions, not a universal strength, yield or lifespan.

Excluded: wood boxes/crates/cable drums, pallets/load boards or their assembly stock, barrels/coopers products, wood wool/flour (31220), waste products (392), unshaped sawnwood (31101), general continuously shaped timber (31211), furniture/construction wedges, particleboard/composite or glued blocks, coatings, impregnation and phytosanitary-treated dispatch products. This cold route excludes onsite drying, thermal treatment, combustion, sanding/planing, wet processing, fuel-powered handling and product assembly. Material operations beyond this scope require an evidence-backed extension with individually resolved exchanges before data release. Untreated solid-wood dunnage is not exempt from phytosanitary obligations merely because cut; this dataset makes no export-compliance claim.

| classification_refs | CPC 3.0 31709; narrower product scope. Current mapping relation and acceptance: `classifications/mappings/cpc-3.0-to-pcr.yaml` and its `acceptance.decision_ref` ADRs |
| covered_products | Accepted solid-wood packaging wedges and contoured/notched blocks with cargo-contact geometry |
| excluded_products | The exclusions in section 1; classification labels alone do not establish applicability |
| representative_product | Unglued uncoated tapered pine packaging wedge, cut to order from kiln-dried sawn stock |
| production_route | Purchased dry stock; electric sawing of taper/contour/notch; dry dust collection; dimensional/grain/fit acceptance; bulk or PE-wrapped dispatch |
| market_state | Finished standalone packaging article at manufacturing gate, ready for customer cargo placement; no downstream installation included |



## 3. Reference Flow



| Field | Value |
| --- | --- |
| What | Supply specified loose packaging wedge or contoured block for declared cargo support/restraint application |
| How much | 1 kg accepted net as-delivered wood at factory gate, excluding wrapping |
| How well | Meet actual order geometry, taper/contour/notch, grain direction, species, moisture, defect and fit acceptance; no generic load rating |
| How long or cycle | One declared production and dispatch cohort; no service life or shipment-count equivalence |
| reference_flow_link | `finished_out` |

| Field | Value |
| --- | --- |
| Reference amount | 1 |
| Reference product flow | Other wooden wrapping and packaging material `1437dd55-5b8c-4866-83a4-b6911ed60bf8` |
| Reference flow property | Mass `93a60a56-a3c8-11da-a746-0800200b9a66` |

| Reference unit | kg |
| Required qualifiers | One actual SKU and accepted geometry; cargo packaging function; botanical species/mix; solid/unglued/uncoated/unimpregnated state; source kiln-dried stock; actual finished dimensions/taper/contour/notch and grain direction; acceptance specification and defect/fit evidence; net delivered mass; dry-basis moisture and method; actual site/period; starting gate; wrapping separate; no phytosanitary treatment/export claim; matched upstream supplier basis |

Declare all required qualifiers in dataset metadata or equivalent reference-flow notes. The broad verified reference identity must be constrained by these physical qualifiers; a kg cannot establish equivalent cargo restraint across geometries. No factory observations are supplied by this PCR.



## 4. Measurement and Unit Rules



| rule_id | Applies to | Required property | Required unit | Rule |
| --- | --- | --- | --- | --- |
| `reference_mass` | reference product | Mass `93a60a56-a3c8-11da-a746-0800200b9a66` | kg | Use calibrated net weighing of accepted wood at dispatch under cp_reference. All inventory is per 1 kg reference flow, including physical residues. No piece-to-kg estimate from nominal geometry. |
| `moisture_basis` | wood and wood residues | Mass and dry-basis moisture | kg; dimensionless | For fractions u=(m_wet-m_dry)/m_dry; m_dry=m_wet/(1+u); water=m_wet-m_dry. Measure paired specimens to oven-dry constant mass, with sampling/calibration evidence, m_dry>0 and u≥0. Divide percentage by100. No fixed species moisture/density. [usda-wood-handbook-2021, Ch4 eq4-2; algebra.] |
| `energy_basis` | `electricity_in` | Net calorific value `93a60a56-a3c8-11da-a746-0800200c9a66` | MJ | Meter customer-side delivered electricity by stage; 1 kWh=3.6 MJ from verified unit group. Database energy-property label does not imply combustion. Do not model onsite generation emissions for purchased electricity. |
| `count_volume_basis` | count/volume records | Mass | kg | Reconcile counts to directly weighed accepted lot mass at the same moisture; use measured density with actual net contoured solid volume only if conversion is necessary. Bounding rectangular volume and stacked volume are not net solid volume. |



## 5. System Boundary



### Boundary Abstraction

| Field | Value |
| --- | --- |
| declared_starting_condition | Purchased kiln-dried untreated sawn stock received at workshop; supplier drying burdens remain upstream |
| starting_condition_role | Gate-to-gate electric conversion to accepted packaging articles |
| product_classification_scope | Only specified solid-wood packaging wedge/contoured-block subset; current CPC31709 mapping relation and acceptance follow classifications/mappings/cpc-3.0-to-pcr.yaml and its acceptance.decision_ref ADRs |
| recursive_input_rule | Purchased same-category unfinished/reworked packaging articles change the route and require separate disclosed supplier gate; never silently substitute for sawn stock or create repeated finishing credit |
| upstream_dataset_requirement | Match stock species, drying, moisture/reference quantity, forestry carbon/allocation, supplier gate and inbound transport; match delivered electricity voltage/geography/period, oil and PE supplier specifications. Identity UUID is not a background dataset. |
| disclosure | Disclose all gates, actual operations, meters, transport providers, exclusions and pending identities/background compatibility; gate-to-gate alone is not cradle-to-gate |

| rule_id | Applies to | Rule | source_ids |
| --- | --- | --- | --- |
| `boundary_operations` | workshop | Include receiving, layout, taper/contour/notch sawing, reject handling, dust collection, electric internal movement, maintenance attribution, fit/geometry acceptance and dispatch; meter stages within one foreground unit. Installation, cargo transport/use, fasteners applied by customers and end-of-life are downstream. Declare capital/tool replacement and employee-activity treatment and assess significance; no automatic zero claim. | `hastiles-packaging-wedges`; `ctu-code-2014` |
| `boundary_dust` | mechanical releases | Measure actual air emissions after controls; captured sawdust is an external material output. EPA PTE tables are screening evidence, not actual emissions. Add each other observed atomic substance before dataset completion; no blanket mass cutoff. | `epa-sawmill-pte-2014` |
| `boundary_carbon` | wood carbon | Track measured dry-wood carbon crossing all material gates and retained stock. No new atmospheric uptake or avoided-disposal credit is created at the workshop. Retain inherited upstream uptake once. This cold non-combustion route has no prescribed positive biogenic CO2 emission; any measured oxidation/decay invalidates assumed absence and requires separate biogenic CO2 and other species rows. Never erase biogenic CO2 from LCI because of a greenhouse-gas reporting convention. | `usda-wood-handbook-2021` |
| `boundary_treatment` | route qualification | Do not represent heated, glued, coated, fumigated or export-certified products with this untreated route. Machining alone is not a processed-wood pest exemption. Require separate treatment evidence and inventory for an extended route. | `ippc-ispm15-2018` |



## 6. Process Inventory Structure



### Process Map

| process_id | process_name | inclusion | inclusion_condition | role | quantitative_reference |
| --- | --- | --- | --- | --- | --- |
| `manufacture` | Cold sawing, collection, acceptance and dispatch | required | Purchased dry stock, all-electric dry route | Single foreground unit with stage meters and material balance | `finished_out` |

The physical graph retains unallocated inputs, accepted wood, shipped wrapping, all coproducts/wastes, emissions and stock changes. Divide same-cohort physical totals once by accepted net wood kg; this is normalization, not allocation. Keep a separate product-specific environmental-burden ledger after allocation; never multiply coproduct physical outputs or internal transfer amounts by allocation shares. Sawing and dispatch are aggregated to one process so the same finished UUID has exactly one reference output; keep substage metering. Internal returns remain internal and are not new purchased inputs. No amount ranges or factory values are asserted. Unknown exchanges are pending, not zero; conditional absence requires records.

## 7. Allocation and Co-product Handling

The dry-mass fallback is a candidate PCR methodological choice for residual joint dry material conversion, subject to site causal assessment and independent review. Wood Handbook supports only moisture-to-dry-mass measurement, not allocation approval. Do not use a dry-mass share for dedicated geometric machining or services with a demonstrated different driver.



| rule_id | Applies to | Rule | source_ids |
| --- | --- | --- | --- |
| `allocation_avoid` | cohort operations | First separate operations/meters by accepted geometry/species and by coproduct destination. Dedicated operations belong to their output. Distinguish physical waste from genuine marketable coproduct using contract/specification/receiver evidence; a receipt of revenue alone is not methodological approval. | `hastiles-packaging-wedges` |
| `allocation_joint` | unavoidable joint burdens | For unavoidable joint dry sawing burdens without a demonstrated causal alternative, use site-measured oven-dry mass shares of accepted wood and genuine coproducts. State products, measured moisture and sums; disclose justification and test an economic-share sensitivity with same-period prices if decision-relevant. Do not allocate burdens to discarded wastes or assume zero disposal burden. Preserve actual full physical outputs and water/carbon ledgers; allocated external input/emission values are a separate account. No survey shares or substitution credit. | `usda-wood-handbook-2021` |

### Calculation Rules

| rule_id | Applies to | Formula or rule | Inputs | Output | source_ids |
| --- | --- | --- | --- | --- | --- |
| `normalize_cohort` | all inventory rows | For each exchange, sum unallocated same-cohort measured amounts after stock reconciliation and divide once by accepted net wood kg. finished_out is 1 kg. Retain physical values separately from burden allocation. | cp_reference; cp_material; cp_energy; cp_auxiliary; cp_residue; cp_dust | physical exchange per 1 kg reference flow |  |
| `energy_conversion` | electricity_in | Multiply metered delivered kWh by3.6 to MJ before cohort normalization; do not confuse fuel heat with electricity. | cp_energy | delivered MJ |  |
| `dry_balance` | wood and residue ledger | Convert each measured wet mass using its own dry-basis moisture per moisture_basis. Dry inputs plus stock decrease equal dry accepted wood, coproducts, discarded wood, emitted wood dust and unexplained residual. Keep water and carbon balances separate; investigate uncertainty rather than assigning a made-up yield. | cp_material; cp_reference; cp_residue; cp_dust | unallocated dry mass, water and carbon closure | `usda-wood-handbook-2021` |
| `dust_bins` | pm_fine; pm_coarse; pm_large | When nested quantities are measured under identical conditions: fine=PM2.5; coarse=PM10-PM2.5; large=compatible total particulate-PM10. Require nonnegative differences and consistent methods/coverage. Otherwise measure disjoint bins or retain missing-bin uncertainty. Never sum PM2.5+PM10+total or subtract incompatible condensable/filterable measurements. | cp_dust | three disjoint emitted masses | `epa-sawmill-pte-2014` |
| `burden_shares` | joint burdens only | Use each accepted product or genuine coproduct dry mass divided by the sum of those dry masses for residual joint burdens after subdivision. Shares sum to1; do not apply shares to physical outputs, waste or internal links. Document any justified causal alternative. | cp_reference; cp_material; cp_residue | separate allocated environmental-burden account | `usda-wood-handbook-2021` |

### Data Quality Requirements

| requirement_id | Applies to | Requirement | Evidence |
| --- | --- | --- | --- |
| `dq_route` | manufacture | Prove dry purchased stock, actual shaped packaging end-state and cold electric route; exclude incompatible treatment/assembly. Document absence rather than assume. | cp_reference; cp_material; cp_energy |
| `dq_identity` | each external flow and background | Verify physical identity separately from measured quantity and provider dataset basis. Blank UUIDs and classification conflicts remain visible; all material missing exchanges/backgrounds block a complete dataset claim. | Direct identity records; supplier/receiver specifications; uncertainty log |
| `dq_period` | all records | Same disclosed cohort/site, traceable source periods and stock changes; keep collection totals, allocation drivers and detection limits. No universal manufacturing ranges inferred. | cp_reference; cp_material; cp_energy; cp_auxiliary; cp_residue; cp_dust |



## 9. Validation Rules



| rule_id | Applies to | Rule | source_ids |
| --- | --- | --- | --- |
| `validate_reference` | finished_out | Exactly one reference output is 1 kg accepted net wood; reference link, UUID, Mass/kg, geometry/function, moisture and packaging exclusion must agree. Do not duplicate its UUID as an intermediate product output. | `ctu-code-2014`; `hastiles-packaging-wedges` |
| `validate_balance` | physical and allocated accounts | Close raw mass/water/carbon within documented measurement uncertainty; same internal transfer has equal quantities at both ends. Reconcile wrapping consumed=shipped+trimmings+stock change; oil issue=used oil+retention+documented loss+stock change. No balancing invented emissions or allocating physical coproduct amounts. | `usda-wood-handbook-2021` |
| `validate_dust` | dust emissions | Check three non-overlapping size bins, compatible monitoring/volume basis and post-control outdoor compartment. Captured and emitted dust cannot be counted twice. PTE values, unspecified-size PM or missing bins cannot prove measured complete emissions. | `epa-sawmill-pte-2014` |
| `validate_completeness` | data release | Resolve all applicable material UUID/background gaps and supplier/receiver compatibility; disclose source classification defects and uncertain coverage. Every added actual flow is atomic and audited. An unavailable identity, incomplete physical balance or unmeasured material emission fails a complete-dataset claim; passing a structural PCR check does not approve methodology or fill missing field data. |  |
| `validate_treatment` | product status | No ISPM15 certification, heat-treatment, load rating, life-cycle completeness or full CPC31709 coverage follows from this manufacturing reference. Reject incompatible states unless the method is formally extended with evidence. | `ippc-ispm15-2018` |



## 10. Published Dataset Profile



| Field | Value |
| --- | --- |
| dataset_role | secondary_dataset; background_dataset |
| downstream_use | Only completed compatible manufacturing inventory for specified untreated shaped packaging articles |

| excluded_use | Cargo securement certification, installation/transport/use/EOL, treated/composite articles, generic sawnwood, equivalent restraint per kg, automatic full CPC31709 mapping |
| required_metadata | All reference qualifiers; site/cohort; starting gate; stock/upstream sources; allocated and physical accounts; inventory/protocol links |
| required_quality_disclosure | Meter/sampling/uncertainty; moisture/carbon basis; dust coverage; source identity defects; unresolved applicable UUIDs/backgrounds; allocation justification/sensitivity; excluded stages |
| update_trigger | Changes to geometry/application, stock species/treatment/moisture, site equipment/control/supply, provider definitions, residue fate, source metadata or verified inventory gaps |
