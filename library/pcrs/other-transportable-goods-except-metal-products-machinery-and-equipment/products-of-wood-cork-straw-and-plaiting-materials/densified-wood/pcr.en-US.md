# Resin-free heat-stabilized densified solid wood

## 1. Scope and Applicability

This PCR concerns unglued solid-wood blanks whose cellular structure is physically compressed by hot pressing and whose compressed state is retained under declared conditioning. The representative is an uncoated yellow-birch tool-handle blank. The route uses the heat-stabilized compression principle of solid-wood Staypak; it does not assume that a contemporary factory achieves historical specimen performance. Solid wood retains continuous grain, without added impregnation resin, adhesive, coating or chemical delignification. An inherently dense species without compression is not densified wood; drying water loss or heat treatment alone is insufficient.

Resin-impregnated compressed wood (compreg) requires separate resin uptake, compression, curing and emissions collection. Ordinary plywood/blockboard forms panels by bonding veneers or lumber strips: bonding pressure does not establish compression fixation of solid wood. MDF and particleboard reconstruct fibres or particles and are excluded. Glued compressed veneers, resin-only mass gain and wet compressed wood without verified fixation are outside this record. CPC 31520 supplies classification context, not evidence of the route.

The representative inventory covers electrically heated platens and electric drives through factory-gate dispatch. Purchased steam/heat, fuel combustion, chemical additions, refrigerants, additional packaging or direct water discharge require additional atomic exchanges and verified supply/treatment boundaries before applying the inventory; none is silently assigned zero. A steam MJ property alone does not establish net delivered heat: supplier definitions and site enthalpy balance must correspond. No universal density multiplier, pressure, temperature, recovery limit or service life is assigned. [Sources: usda-wood-handbook-2021; usda-staypak-1956; cabral-densification-2022.]

| How much | 1 kg net accepted conditioned wood at factory gate, excluding packaging |
| How well | Declared species, dimensions, moisture basis of density, compression direction and fixation/recovery acceptance; verified against intended-use specification |
| How long or cycle | One declared production/dispatch accounting period; no end-use service life assigned |

These qualifiers must be declared in the data package. The verified Wood material foreground identity leaves species, form, treatment, moisture, route and provider unspecified and includes the declared resin-free compressed solid-wood subset only with these physical qualifications. Require actual yellow birch, continuous solid grain, no added resin/glue/coating, measured paired compression and conditioned recovery, geometry and net accepted dispatch mass. The UUID does not establish a densification production background, quantity, mechanical performance or durable fixation by itself; each actual provider and reference-quantity basis remains independently subject to verification.

## 4. Measurement and Unit Rules

| rule_id | Applies to | Required property | Required unit | Rule |
| --- | --- | --- | --- | --- |
| reference_mass | reference product | Mass `93a60a56-a3c8-11da-a746-0800200b9a66` | kg | Use net accepted conditioned wood mass as denominator; exclude packaging and rejects. Oven-dry or gross mass is not a substitute. |
| moisture_basis | birch_stock, finished_blank | Mass | kg | u = (m_wet - m_dry) / m_dry; m_dry = m_wet / (1 + u). u is a dry-basis mass ratio; divide percentages by 100 first. Compare paired feedstock/final density at comparable moisture and temperature, separating water loss from physical compression. |
| energy_unit | electricity | Net calorific value | MJ | Record low-voltage AC consumption; 1 kWh = 3.6 MJ. This conversion assigns neither press efficiency nor net delivered steam heat. |
| hydraulic_volume | hydraulic_oil | Volume | m3 | Use actual fluid volume at recorded temperature; V = m / rho(T) only with measured positive finite density in kg/m3 for the same grade and temperature. Report V/D in m3/kg and retain m = rho(T)*V for mass balance; no default density. |

#### Inputs

##### Product flows

###### Kiln-dried yellow-birch solid sawn stock (`birch_stock`)

Supply actual unglued, untreated kiln-dried yellow-birch sawn stock. The broad hardwood identity is at the sawmill gate; verify actual botanical species, moisture, dimensions, sawing orientation, supplier gate and absence of bonding or chemical treatment. Its illustrative downstream seat-frame use does not define this product use. Species-unspecified identity is not a species-verified background: actual hardwood/species and gate compatibility must be established separately; unknown compatibility remains incomplete. The adopted sawnwood classification requires actual stock thicker than 6 mm; thinner stock needs another verified identity. Do not substitute coniferous stock.

###### Alternating current (`electricity`)

Applies to low-voltage (<1 kV) customer-side AC supply only. Meter electric conditioning, platens, press drive, cooling, trimming, extraction, auxiliaries and attributable idle/reject loads; reconcile transformer losses with supplier boundary. The adopted record specifies CN consumption supply: verify actual site region/year, supplier mix, voltage, user-side delivery/loss boundary and native electrical-energy basis; the identity does not make the Chinese background a global default.

###### Mineral-base hydraulic oil for press (`hydraulic_oil`)

Conditional hydraulic press: use this broad hydraulic-fluid identity only for the actual mineral-base formulation and documented additive grade. Supplier delivery and background composition must match; a generic identity alone is not a formulation-specific dataset. Record native liquid volume at measured temperature; where only mass is recorded, divide by positive finite measured grade-specific density at matching temperature. No generic density is assumed. Count fresh fluid introduced from external supply/unused stock once, never pump throughput or repeated standing charge; drained used oil is a separate output, not a subtraction from virgin input.

###### Polyethylene film (`packing_film`)

Conditional polyethylene dispatch wrapping only; exclude its mass from the net wood denominator. Retain actual polymer grade, film mass and packaging specification; PET is not PE. Require unsupported non-self-adhesive nonlaminated PE film, actual composition and provider compatibility. The source names/CAS/comment identify PE film while CPC29220 incorrectly classifies luggage; retain this source clarification debt, not a claim of repaired classification.

##### Waste flows

###### sawdust waste (`captured_sawdust`)

Captured sawing/sanding dust sent to external waste treatment, measured separately from escaped airborne particles. Confirm the actual pre/post-press thermal state, absence of chemical impregnation/glue/resin and the selected untreated-combustion-or-recovery identity against the actual receiver. A different contamination or treatment route requires another identity review. If marketed as a co-product, establish a product-flow identity before using that route.

###### Untreated yellow-birch planing shavings for waste treatment (`planing_shavings`)

Conditional planing; separately weigh actual loose yellow-birch shavings with their pre/post-compression origin, moisture and absence of added glue, resin or coating. They are not automatically sawing dust, engineered board feedstock, wood chips or pellet fuel. The broad Wood waste identity represents collected non-agglomerated wood waste on a mass basis, with composition and fate specified by the generating process. Verify actual manufacturing origin, pre/post-press state, moisture, contamination and receiving/provider compatibility before linkage. This identity does not establish pelletizing or briquetting, clean-biomass-fuel status, harmlessness, recycling eligibility, combustion treatment or an avoided-product credit.

###### Rejected densified yellow-birch solid blanks for waste treatment (`rejected_solid`)

Weigh unrecoverable rejected blanks and solid trim separately from dust and shavings. Record actual heat-compression history, recovery failure/defect, moisture, no added resin/glue/coating and receiving treatment. Continuous solid-wood compression is not agglomeration of wood particles. The broad Wood waste identity covers collected non-agglomerated waste, with composition and fate specified by the generating process; verify the actual rejected material, contamination and receiving/provider compatibility without borrowing a disposal background or assuming recycling eligibility or an avoided-product credit. Internal rework is retained inside the unit and counted once; it is not simultaneously a waste export.

## 7. Allocation and Co-product Handling

| rule_id | applies_to | rule | source_ids |
| --- | --- | --- | --- |
| allocation_physical | all inventory rows | Keep the unallocated physical wood/water/carbon balance separate from allocated environmental burdens; internal links have equal quantities, and physical co-product outputs are not multiplied by allocation shares. |  |
| allocation_subdivision | manufacture | Prefer subdivision and direct metering; shared electricity uses measured load/runtime drivers with residual reconciliation, not nameplate-power guesses. |  |
| allocation_residues | manufacture | Waste rows describe waste transfers. Sold sawdust/shavings/trim require verified separate atomic product rows and co-product determination rather than waste UUID reuse. Establish causal allocation before assigning burdens; otherwise disclose economic prices/period/shares and sensitivity. No automatic recycling credit. |  |

### Calculation Rules

| rule_id | Applies to | Formula or rule | Inputs | Output | source_ids |
| --- | --- | --- | --- | --- | --- |
| period_normalization | all inventory rows | D = period accepted net conditioned wood in kg; divide each physical period exchange total by D to obtain its amount per 1 kg reference flow. D must be positive; missing site values are not fabricated. | cp_reference; all collection protocols | exchange per 1 kg reference flow |  |
| hydraulic_conversion | hydraulic_oil | q = V / D; V = m / rho(T) when measured mass is converted using the same grade at measured T. Keep physical oil mass m = rho(T)*V and operating-stock/drain/loss balance separately; never infer a default density or subtract drains from virgin input. | cp_hydraulic; cp_reference | m3 hydraulic fluid per kg reference flow, plus separate physical mass balance |  |
| density_compression | birch_stock, finished_blank | rho = m / V; verify physical density increase using paired initial rho0 and final rhof at matching moisture/temperature, with volume change and dry-wood mass loss. Compression ratio CR = (t0 - tf) / t0; release springback SB = (tr - tc) / tc; this record's cyclic compression-loss ratio R = (tcycle - tf) / (t0 - tf). Ratios are dimensionless; nonpositive denominators are undefined. Measure tcycle after return to the conditioning state of tf. R is this record's explicit measurement convention and must not be compared directly with differently defined literature SR indices. | cp_wood; cp_reference; cp_press | density and separate recovery test indicators | usda-wood-handbook-2021; cabral-densification-2022 |
| physical_balance | manufacture | Before burden allocation, reconcile whole-stream mass and elemental carbon separately: opening stock + inputs = closing stock + outputs + reported residual, using actual composition and all relevant boundary crossings. Chemical reactions do not generate or consume total elemental carbon. Separately reconcile molecular H2O and reactive wood/resin components using opening stock + inputs + evidenced formation = closing stock + outputs + evidenced consumption + reported residual. Quantify only actual cure/thermal/oxidation pathways and extent; phase changes are transfers, not reactions. A zero reaction term requires evidence of absence; unknown extent remains unresolved, with no assumed full cure, generic yield or balancing emission. Track retained binder/additives and wood versus fossil carbon separately. Internal transfers cancel only with matched endpoints; measured outputs containing reaction products are counted once. Keep uncertainty explicit and do not apply burden shares to physical outputs. Use measured or traceable species/composition carbon fractions, not a universal default; CO2 carbon mass = CO2 mass × 12/44. | cp_wood; cp_reference; cp_residues; cp_water; cp_air | physical balances and residuals | usda-wood-handbook-2021 |

### Data Quality Requirements

| requirement_id | Applies to | Requirement | Evidence |
| --- | --- | --- | --- |
| identity_route | all inventory rows | Verify continuous solid grain, actual compression/fixation and absence of glue/impregnation; UUID identity alone does not establish background compatibility | cp_wood; cp_press; cp_reference |
| coverage | all inventory rows | Declare applicable/not applicable/unmeasured and detection limits per row; unknown is not zero, and additional species/auxiliaries need atomic rows | cp_air; cp_aux; batch records |
| physical_basis | all inventory rows | Both languages use accepted net conditioned wood; retain biogenic CO2 in LCI and never add nested PM totals | cp_reference; cp_air |
| source_scope | manufacture | Historical glued yellow-poplar veneer tests, coniferous surveys and sawmill PTE factors are not defaults for this solid-wood factory; require site full-route records | usda-staypak-1956; site records |

## 9. Validation Rules

| rule_id | applies_to | rule | source_ids |
| --- | --- | --- | --- |
| validate_reference | finished_blank | Require verified Wood material identity with all actual resin-free yellow-birch compression/fixation, moisture, geometry, net mass and provider/quantity qualifiers. MDF, lumber-core plywood, ordinary bonded panels and generic man-made board are not substitutes. Exactly one reference-output row is required; physical identity success does not complete measurements or background linkage. | usda-wood-handbook-2021; usda-staypak-1956; cabral-densification-2022 |
| validate_fixation | manufacture | Verify physical compression and fixation using paired mass/volume/moisture and pressing, release and conditioning-cycle records; water loss, natural density or untested stability claims are insufficient. | usda-wood-handbook-2021; usda-staypak-1956; cabral-densification-2022 |
| validate_quantities | all inventory rows | Use one positive D with actual pressure/temperature/time/moisture and stage measurements; unknown quantities/identities remain unresolved, with no invented enhancement multiplier from historical data. | usda-wood-handbook-2021; usda-staypak-1956; cabral-densification-2022 |
| validate_hydraulic | hydraulic_oil | Confirm actual mineral formulation, supplier/background gate, native Volume/m3 basis, matching measured T and positive finite density for conversions. Fresh volume uses the same D; kg-only evidence without matched density is incomplete. Waste oil stays a separate mass output and physical operating stock balance; no repeated circulation or netting of drains. |  |
| validate_air | manufacture | Match outdoor-air compartment; indoor, stratospheric, long-term and biogenic-CO2 uptake/correction flows are not substitutes. Use non-overlapping particulate bins, separate methanol/formaldehyde/acetic acid, and do not hide additional species inside total VOC. | usda-wood-handbook-2021; usda-staypak-1956; cabral-densification-2022 |
| validate_balances | manufacture | Check physical wood/water/carbon balances, equal internal handoffs and residuals; allocation shares apply only to the relevant burden ledger. Missing background compatibility or measurement coverage is incomplete. | usda-wood-handbook-2021; usda-staypak-1956; cabral-densification-2022 |

## 10. Published Dataset Profile

| Field | Value |
| --- | --- |
| dataset_role | secondary_dataset; background_dataset |
| downstream_use | Following complete identity/measurement/background verification and independent review, use for the actual tool-handle-blank production route |
| allowed_use | Matching species/route/delivery state and declared application after actual collection and provider qualification; candidate methodology does not itself supply a complete measured dataset |
| excluded_use | Whole-CPC-31520 average; ordinary panels/compreg/MDF; end-use functional equivalence; unverified stability or enhancement multipliers |
| required_metadata | Site/year/species; process and pressure/temperature/recovery records; net-mass moisture basis; identities/backgrounds/waste routes |
| required_quality_disclosure | Row-level measured/unresolved/not-applicable status; uncertainty, balance residuals, allocation drivers and all uncovered scope |
| update_trigger | Change of species, heat supply, pressure/temperature route, adhesive/resin, stability, specification, background or waste destination |
