# Natural one-piece cork stopper blanks, punched and dry-sized

## 1. Scope and Applicability

This PCR covers only cylindrical one-piece natural Quercus suber cork stopper blanks made from purchased boiled, stabilized planks by strip cutting, hollow-tube punching, dry dimensional sizing and grading, delivered unwashed, uncolmated and uncoated to a downstream finisher. They are completed manufactured intermediates before semi-finishing; bottling performance and food-contact compliance are not established. JRC separates manufacturing from washing/colmation/coating and final treatment; the Spanish case distinguishes punching from turning. Sources: `jrc-cork-chain-2017`, `spanish-natural-stopper-2022`.

Agglomerated stoppers require granulate production, measured formulation, binder and curing data; technical stoppers with natural discs additionally require disc manufacture and bonding. Boards require density, dimensions, use, binder/self-bonding and board thermal-treatment boundaries and cannot use this method. Exclude turned stoppers, multi-piece bonded stoppers, colmated stoppers, agglomerated/micro-agglomerated stoppers, bar-top assemblies, finished coated bottle closures and agglomerated boards. No generic adhesive, coating, washing recipe or packaging atmosphere is prescribed.

| --- | --- |
| What | Supply natural one-piece cork stopper blanks for downstream finishing |
| How much | 1 kg accepted net stopper-blank mass excluding delivery packaging |
| How well | Delivered to declared order dimensions, grade, moisture and acceptance records; no claimed equivalent bottling performance |
| How long or cycle | One production and factory-gate handover cycle; no closure service-life claim |
| reference_flow_link | `stopper_out` |

| Field | Value |

| Reference amount | 1 |
| Reference product flow | Articles of natural cork, agglomerated cork and articles thereof `9dee16fe-f882-489f-9b63-3c0ee5148e02` |
| Reference flow property | Mass `93a60a56-a3c8-11da-a746-0800200b9a66` |

Declare every required qualifier in foreground metadata, process notes or reference-flow comments. The broad UUID identifies only this physical subset; compatibility with a manufactured-article description does not establish bottling readiness or any provider background process covering this intermediate gate.

## 4. Measurement and Unit Rules

| rule_id | Applies to | Required property | Required unit | Rule |
| --- | --- | --- | --- | --- |
| reference_mass | reference product | Mass `93a60a56-a3c8-11da-a746-0800200b9a66` | kg | Q is total accepted net as-delivered blank mass for the same period and route, excluding packaging; use calibrated scales, tare and lot moisture records. Normalize every row per 1 kg reference flow. |
| moisture_balance | plank_in; stopper_out; offcut_out; dust_out; vapour_out | Mass | kg | Measure wet mass m and wet-basis water fraction w separately; dry solids m×(1−w), water mass m×w; dry cork mass equals dry solids multiplied by the measured cork fraction, excluding abrasive/binder contamination; convert dry-basis moisture u by w=u/(1+u). Density or count cannot replace net mass; packaging is outside the cork balance. |
| electricity_units | electricity_in | Net calorific value `93a60a56-a3c8-11da-a746-0800200c9a66` | MJ | Meter electricity delivered to the user; 1 kWh=3.6 MJ. The property name follows the database energy chain, not a fuel heating value or delivered heat basis. Verify voltage below 1 kV and supplier loss boundary. |

## 5. System Boundary

### Boundary Abstraction

| Field | Value |
| --- | --- |
| declared_starting_condition | Boiled stabilized selected unbonded Quercus suber planks received at manufacturer; moisture, thickness, quality grade, supplier and inbound transport declared |
| starting_condition_role | Foreground starting point; not burden-free bark |
| product_classification_scope | Punched one-piece blanks within natural articles of 31922; incoming planks and outgoing offcuts are adjacent categories, not reference articles |
| recursive_input_rule | If same-category blanks are purchased for further sizing, distinguish prior supplier production from added processing; do not recursively expand the same site record. The provider route must still satisfy these qualifiers |
| upstream_dataset_requirement | Link bark origin/management, stripping, forest handling, stabilization, boiling and heat supply, water reuse/discharge, post-boil stabilization/selection and plank delivery; missing scope is an upstream coverage gap and bars complete cradle-to-gate claims |
| disclosure | Foreground from received planks to accepted blank handover; washing/disinfection, colmation, bonding, coating, bottling, use and end of life are outside this gate; measure packaging and disclose period stocks and co-products |

| rule_id | applies_to | rule | source_ids |
| --- | --- | --- | --- |
| sb_start | all inventory rows | Retain bark and boiling upstream burdens. Prepared-plank background must match treatment, moisture, heat, water and effluent boundaries. If supplier data end at raw bark, add boiling/stabilization; do not count the same boiling twice. | jrc-cork-chain-2017; spanish-natural-stopper-2022 |
| sb_route | conversion | Include receipt, strip cutting, punching, dry sizing, grading, extraction and pack-out only. No foreground boiler, steam, combustion, granulation/bonding or washing/coating; a facility performing them needs an expanded, evidenced atomic inventory and cannot conceal them inside this route. | jrc-cork-chain-2017; spanish-natural-stopper-2022 |
| sb_stages | conversion | Aggregate conversion and handover into one foreground unit while retaining separate stage mass, electricity and loss ledgers. Actual internal transfers must agree at both ends and are not extra external outputs; only one accepted reference output is allowed. |  |
| sb_chemicals | conversion | Do not substitute generic glue or coating for unknown formulations. Actual wash chemicals, colmation agents, silicone, paraffin, ink or preserving gas are outside this route and require actual substances, concentration/wet-dry basis and doses for a separate assessment. Purchased belt binder and box glue stay in their manufactured-consumable backgrounds, not invented foreground dosing. | jrc-cork-chain-2017; spanish-natural-stopper-2022 |
| sb_carbon | all inventory rows | Keep separate physical dry-cork, water and biogenic-carbon ledgers. Absence of site combustion does not permit deleting biogenic CO2 from LCI: retain upstream heat-source biogenic/fossil emissions and any actual foreground oxidation, resolving correct species and compartment, regardless of GHG reporting convention. Stocked carbon is not automatically negative emission or permanent storage. |  |

## 6. Process Inventory Structure

### Process Map

| process_id | process_name | inclusion | inclusion_condition | role | quantitative_reference |
| --- | --- | --- | --- | --- | --- |
| conversion | Plank receipt, strip cutting/punching, dry sizing/grading and handover | required | This one declared route | foreground production | 1 kg accepted net blanks |

Stage records follow receipt → cutting → punching → sizing → grading → pack-out. Packaging leaves with blanks without inventing a second product output. There are 13 atomic rows; no foreground wash effluent or combustion emissions. Conditional packaging rows require actual presence/absence and quantity. Maintenance consumables, incoming packaging residues, abnormal contamination and actual additional emissions cannot be omitted: add specific atomic rows and identities after physical screening before completing a dataset, rather than fabricated generic rows.

###### Low-voltage electricity (`electricity_in`)

Meter the supplied consumption mix below 1 kV for cutting, punching, sizing, sorting, extraction and packing. Source geography is CN and the gate is grid-average supply to the user; verify actual site/provider region, year, mix, voltage and delivery/loss boundary before background use. Convert metered kWh to native MJ; the database Net calorific value label is an electrical-energy chain, not heat or fuel.

###### Coated abrasive belt for dry cork sizing (`abrasive_in`)

Actual whole manufactured coated belt for dry cork sizing, not bulk alumina, industrial diamond or a presumed paper sheet. Record supplier article, grit species, backing and binder, dimensions, new mass, stock and replacement count; keep all components in the purchased mixture background without duplicate foreground component inputs. The broad belt Product/Mass/kg has no fixed grit/backing recipe or metal-only route; source production mix at plant CN requires actual provider geography, year and gate compatibility. Unknown actual formulation and quantity remain collection requirements, not inferred defaults.

###### Polyethylene film bag (`film_in`)

Conditional: only the actual unsupported, non-self-adhesive, non-laminated PE film used to contain blanks. Record polymer grade/CAS9002-88-4, composition and mass, bag conversion and seal method; resolve a different whole packaging identity if backing, adhesive or laminate is actually present. No SO2 atmosphere, paraffin or silicone is assumed. Raw names/CAS/comment establish PE film despite conflicting CPC29220 luggage classification; source classification clarification and actual supplier grade/geography/year/gate compatibility remain pending, not claimed resolved.

###### Corrugated paperboard shipping box (`carton_in`)

Conditional: weigh actual complete corrugated shipping boxes and record flute, fibre composition, printing, closure, supplier and stock-adjusted quantity. This source identifies a completed at-plant technology-mix box with 16.6% primary and 83.4% recycled fibre; these are conditional source-compatibility limits requiring the actual supplier fraction basis and manufacturing gate to match, never a default box recipe, recycled-content credit or foreground glue dose. If actual composition/state differs or remains unverified, resolve compatible whole-box data before dataset use; no paperboard feedstock or unsupported optical-assembly/folding-carton substitution.

#### Outputs

##### Product flows

###### Accepted natural one-piece stopper blanks (`stopper_out`)

Exactly one reference output: accepted cylindrical single-piece natural cork blanks after dry sizing and grading, before washing, colmation, printing or coating; net cork mass excludes delivery packaging. The broad manufactured-article identity is restricted to this subset, not a ready-to-bottle closure.

- Collection protocol: `cp_material`
- Sources: `jrc-cork-chain-2017`; `spanish-natural-stopper-2022`

###### Unbonded cork cutting offcuts for external granulation (`offcut_out`)

Keep stripped edges, perforated strip remnants and rejected natural cork pieces in a separately weighed unbonded coarse offcut stream for the identified external granulator. Product status requires documented applicable by-product/product compliance, customer grade/contamination specifications and acceptance, and actual economic function; payment alone does not establish a Product flow. If the stream remains waste, change type and resolve a compatible Waste identity before dataset use. No foreground grinding, densimetric grading, binder or agglomeration. Record outgoing gate, wet mass, moisture, grade and stocks separately from purchased boiled/stabilized planks despite shared broad UUID; do not equate either exchange or create a self-referential provider loop.

- Selected flow: Natural cork, debacked or roughly squared, or in blocks, plates, sheets or strip, crushed, granulated or ground cork, waste cork `e03a0a0b-6dd8-4190-8204-3210fa9b51f4`

##### Waste flows

###### Captured cork sizing dust (`dust_out`)

Weigh actual separately captured cork sanding/dry-sizing dust with abrasive contamination, component dry masses/carbon, moisture, ownership and the identified external fuel-use or granulation receiver. The source Waste identity specifically covers stopper sanding/finishing dust for those receiver routes; verify actual acceptance/contamination and receiving treatment/provider scope, not clean cork or an arbitrary disposal stream. Current waste status must be documented; payment alone cannot change it to Product, and a demonstrated economic co-product requires a compatible type/identity before use. Concordant cork name/comment/route support the physical locator despite CPC39283 wood-waste classification; supplier/source classification clarification remains unresolved. No free burdens or avoided-fuel credit.

###### Spent cork-sizing abrasive belt (`abrasive_out`)

Actual removed whole cork-sizing belt after use, including remaining abrasive grains, backing, binder and adhering cork/moisture. Weigh dispatched mass, reconcile new belt consumption, component wear into collected dust/outdoor particles, attached cork and stocks, and document contamination and receiver treatment/provider compatibility. The broad surface-finishing Spent abrasive waste/Mass/kg has no metal-only or loose-powder restriction; do not substitute metal-finishing polishing waste, unused belts or clean cork dust. Account adhering cork and its water once in the separate cork/component ledgers; no default waste fraction or treatment credit.

## 7. Allocation and Co-product Handling

| rule_id | applies_to | rule | source_ids |
| --- | --- | --- | --- |
| alloc_separate | conversion | First avoid allocation by stage metering or defensible unit subdivision. Keep physical process/stock/water/carbon ledgers separate from allocated environmental-burden accounts; trace plank cost/burdens to output grades and sold offcuts. | spanish-natural-stopper-2022 |
| alloc_basis | conversion | When allocation cannot be avoided, assess physical causality and use measured physical relationships where valid; otherwise use economic shares from same-period factory-gate quantity×unit price, recording all outputs with economic function, currency, price window and sensitivity. Never default to case quantities or allocation percentages. | spanish-natural-stopper-2022 |
| alloc_physical | all inventory rows | Apply allocation shares to burdens, never to physical co-product outputs. Divide reference-product burdens by Q; offcut/dust physical rows retain actual total amounts/Q and cannot disappear into yield or negative inputs. Record only actual external net exchanges once for internal reuse. |  |
| alloc_residues | offcut_out; dust_out | Outputs with payment revenue and economic function participate in the selected allocation; waste without economic function gains no share merely from recyclability, and treatment-burden ownership must be transparent. dust_out is currently a waste exchange; if records establish an economic co-product, change flow type and resolve a compatible identity before rechecking. Document applicable by-product/product or waste status and customer acceptance specifications separately; payment alone does not establish Product status or compatible treatment. Do not combine economic allocation with undeclared fuel-substitution credits. |  |

| cp_pack | conversion | Film and shipping boxes | packing_records | packaging presence/absence; PE grade/composition; film unit mass; box composition/mass; closure method; counts; period; delivery recipient | Reconcile purchases/issues; sample tare-corrected component masses against pack-out/shipping counts and stock; do not transfer finished-closure case packaging amounts or atmosphere. Aggregation requirement: Same-period component mass actually consumed / Q; per 1 kg reference flow | kg; count | Each packaging lot and issue period | Same period as cp_material | Factory-gate pack-out at this boundary | per 1 kg reference flow | Supplier material/composition; weighing; shipping/stock records |
| cp_air | conversion | Outdoor particulate emissions in three disjoint size intervals | sampling_and_operating_records | outlet/fugitive source; size cut; method/detection limit; concentration; wet/dry/T/P basis; air volume; control state; operating hours; cork/abrasive composition; sampling period | Post-control size-resolved sampling and air-volume metering covering operating states and fugitives; integrate concentration×volume at common wet/dry/T/P basis. Below-detection results retain upper bounds/uncertainty; unsampled intervals remain gaps; captured mass is not emitted mass. Aggregation requirement: Same-period released total in each disjoint interval / Q; per 1 kg reference flow | kg; mg/m3; m3; h | Representative states and after control changes, with continuous operating-hour records | Corresponding cp_material period, with extrapolation coverage disclosed | Actual outdoor releases; air subcompartment unspecified | per 1 kg reference flow | Sampling reports, flow checks, detection limits, controls/operating records |

### Calculation Rules

| rule_id | Applies to | Formula or rule | Inputs | Output | source_ids |
| --- | --- | --- | --- | --- | --- |
| normalize_exchange | all inventory rows | Divide each same-period physical row total by Q; fix the reference row at 1 kg. Divide allocated burdens by Q separately; never alter physical quantities using burden shares. | row total; Q; linked collection protocol | exchange per 1 kg reference flow |  |
| electricity_conversion | electricity_in | E_MJ=3.6×E_kWh at the same user-side meter boundary. | E_kWh; cp_energy | E_MJ |  |
| water_reconciliation | vapour_out | Use cork-associated water consistently, accounting separately for non-cork or abrasive-borne water. Net evaporated cork water = incoming plank water + opening cork-stock water − water in blanks/offcuts/captured dust/cork adhering to spent belts − closing cork-stock water − water carried by released cork particles where actually measured. Keep particle-associated water separate from water vapour and non-cork/abrasive water; no water fraction is invented for a dry-particle measurement. First verify absence of other water exchanges and non-water volatile losses. Do not clamp negative results to zero; investigate moisture gain/other exchanges and add characterization. | wet mass; wet-basis moisture; stock water; cp_material | evaporated kg water |  |
| pm_intervals | pm25_out; pmcoarse_out; pmover10_out | For one matched sampling system, fine=PM2.5, coarse=PM10−PM2.5, larger=comparable total particles−PM10; differences require complete method coverage and nonnegative values. mg×10^-6=kg; concentration×same-basis volume gives mass. Cumulative PM10/total are reconciliation quantities, not extra LCI emissions. | size-resolved concentrations; air volume; operating hours; cp_air | three disjoint emitted masses |  |

### Data Quality Requirements

| requirement_id | Applies to | Requirement | Evidence |
| --- | --- | --- | --- |
| dq_route | conversion | Verify boiled stabilized incoming Quercus suber, unbonded one-piece punching without washing/coating and handover to finishing; align supplier/order/site boundaries. | supplier/order/acceptance records |
| dq_balance | all inventory rows | Physical dry-cork/water/biogenic-carbon balances include period stocks, actual output grades, offcuts, captured dust, wear composition, adhering dust and releases; compare residuals with instrument uncertainty and explain, without invented yield/tolerance. | cp_material; cp_abrasive; cp_air |
| dq_background | all inventory rows | Identity success is not complete background data: check state/unit/supply boundary/geography/time/losses for every provider link and disclose unresolved UUIDs/source classification defects. | provider scope evidence |
| dq_screen | conversion | Screen actual maintenance oil, cleaning agents, input packaging residues, additional consumables and abnormal emissions; add atomic exchanges/collection where present and do not claim dataset completeness with remaining gaps. | site screening and maintenance records |

## 9. Validation Rules

| rule_id | applies_to | rule | source_ids |
| --- | --- | --- | --- |
| val_reference | stopper_out | Check exactly one reference output, 1 kg net mass, Q and all qualifiers defining this subset of the broad UUID; do not add a packaging-stage output with the same reference UUID. |  |
| val_denominator | all inventory rows | EN/ZH reference, all 13 inventory bases, collection aggregation and calculations use per 1 kg accepted net blanks; align unit conversion and time windows. |  |
| val_route | conversion | Do not merge agglomerated stoppers, turning, disc bonding, boards or finished-closure washing/coating into this route; disclose missing purchased-plank upstream boiling heat/water/effluent. | jrc-cork-chain-2017; spanish-natural-stopper-2022 |
| val_air | pm25_out; pmcoarse_out; pmover10_out; vapour_out | Check elementary species, air/unspecified subcompartment, Mass/kg, disjoint size intervals and sampling coverage. Workplace dust, captured waste and water-compartment vapour cannot stand in for outdoor releases; actual biogenic CO2 cannot be deleted for reporting convention. |  |
| val_completeness | all inventory rows | Report specific unresolved/skipped scope for missing consumable identity, background chains, emission measurements or unexplained balances; do not claim complete LCI or cradle-to-gate. Method is available for independent review; actual site data still require collection. |  |
