# Uncoated solid hardwood mortise-and-tenon door leaf at factory gate

## 1. Scope and Applicability

Applies to a single accepted uncoated solid hardwood stile-and-rail door leaf with solid hardwood panels, made by mortise-and-tenon joinery and one-part PVAc ambient bonding. It is a factory-made, sanded and inspected door slab requiring downstream finishing and installation. This is a manufacturing declared unit, not a complete installed doorway or a lifetime service comparison. The market route is evidenced by `adk-solid-door-route`; this PCR does not adopt that manufacturer’s mass, recipe or species share.

Distinguish solid-wood leaves from wood-frame filled-core/flush leaves (paper honeycomb, particleboard, mineral or composite cores and skins), independent frames/thresholds, and complete door sets. Only the first, unglazed and without hardware/seals/coating, is covered. Exclude cellular-board semifinished products under CPC 31610, engineered/veneered leaves, glass, factory-coated leaves, exterior-weatherproof or certified acoustic/fire door sets. This method includes door-level joinery, cure, final machining and acceptance rather than repeating a panel PCR. On-site kiln drying, boilers, thermal pressing, washing and solvent finishing are outside the selected route; evidence of them requires an explicit route extension with additional atomic exchanges.

## 3. Reference Flow

| Field | Value |
| --- | --- |
| What | A door leaf that will close an interior opening after finishing and fitting |
| How much | 1 kg of accepted door-leaf net mass of one declared configuration; physical leaves are weighed individually |
| How well | Conform to the actual signed drawing and documented dimensional, joint and appearance acceptance; no assumed acoustic/fire rating |
| How long or cycle | One manufacturing campaign through factory dispatch; service life is outside this declared unit |
| reference_flow_link | accepted_leaf |

| Field | Value |

| Reference amount | 1 |
| Reference product flow | Doors and their frames and thresholds made out of wood `6ae3ac1d-ab21-4c46-8d5a-cf630e05496a` |

| Reference unit group | Units of mass `93a60a57-a4c8-11da-a746-0800200c9a66` |
| Reference unit | kg |
| Required qualifiers | single door leaf identity; interior use; species and origin; net mass and moisture; height/width/thickness and area; solid panel/stile/rail dimensions and joints; no filled core or skin; glue formulation/solids/water and supplier bonding conditions; uncoated state; hardware/seals/glass absent; acceptance drawing and results; actual functional claim and acoustic/fire evidence or explicit no claim; factory/meter voltage/campaign; packaging |

Declare every qualifier in dataset metadata or linked primary records. The broad database name is an identity anchor narrowed to this leaf; it is never permission to select a frame or door set.

## 4. Measurement and Unit Rules

| rule_id | Applies to | Required property | Required unit | Rule |
| --- | --- | --- | --- | --- |
| reference_mass | reference product | Mass | kg | Use 1 kg accepted uncoated door-leaf net mass, excluding all packaging. Under cp_mass weigh each complete accepted leaf on a calibrated scale, identify its configuration and acceptance record, then sum the same-configuration campaign net masses. No default per-door weight; no area-times-assumed-density substitute. |
| wood_moisture | hardwood, clean_offcut, clean_sawdust, glued_dust | Mass | kg | Record as-received mass and dry-basis moisture separately. For wood only, dry mass = wet mass / (1 + dry-basis moisture in percent / 100). Determine moisture under cp_material using species-calibrated meters checked against representative oven-dry samples; glue/abrasive fractions are not wood. |
| electricity_basis | electricity | Net calorific value | MJ | Convert actual metered kWh to MJ by multiplying by 3.6, matching the verified unit group; reconcile purchased medium-voltage supply and internal losses. |
| geometry | reference product | Mass | kg | Retain actual measured door area and thickness as configuration descriptors, not mass substitutes. Supplied acoustic/fire declarations must match the tested leaf/assembly, hardware, seals and installation; absent assembly evidence cannot create a rating. |

Preserve stage meters and mass records inside one aggregated foreground unit, avoiding a fictitious intermediate door output. | adk-solid-door-route; woodtech-door-quality |
| b-route | door_manufacture | Confirm solid panels, no added catalyst or coatings, dry cleanup and no on-site combustion. If actual operations differ, re-assess scope and add each chemical, utility, waste and species emission separately; never suppress known exchanges to fit the route. | usda-wood-handbook-2021 |
| b-background | all inventory rows | Require supplier process boundaries and quantities independently of flow identity; account for outsourcing and actual material transport with separately identified transport services in the completed dataset. |  |

Packaging has a separate dispatch ledger and is excluded from leaf net mass. Internal transfers and rework have equal quantities at both stage endpoints. |  |
| a-attribution | door_manufacture | Prefer dedicated campaign meters and withdrawals. For shared electricity/extraction/air systems, use measured runtime/load or submeter evidence and disclose the attribution driver. Keep environmental burden accounting separate from physical outputs; never multiply physical waste or co-product quantity by a burden share. |  |
| a-residues | clean_offcut, clean_sawdust, glued_dust | Rows here are waste transfers with actual treatment links and no avoided-product credit. If residues are deliberately produced marketable co-products, document that status and re-assess allocation with independent review before issuing that dataset; no default substitution or economic split is supplied. |  |

## 8. Foreground Data Collection, Calculation, and Quality Rules

Use a single configuration and campaign with measured accepted net mass S (kg) = sum of individual accepted leaf net masses. Rejects and packaging are excluded from S; their production inputs and wastes remain in the numerator. All collection protocols return amounts per 1 kg reference flow. Record the physical campaign totals alongside the normalized result. No invented per-door mass or industry recipe is needed.

### Data Collection Protocols

| protocol_id | process_id | flow_role | record_type | raw_fields | collection_method | unit | frequency | temporal_coverage | site_scope | aggregation_rule | quality_evidence |
| --- | --- | --- | --- | --- | --- | --- | --- | --- | --- | --- | --- |
| cp_mass | door_manufacture | accepted leaf net mass | foreground_record | configuration; batch; leaf identifier; calibration; individual net masses; accepted count; S; drawing; height/width/thickness; area; acceptance defects; claim/test references | Weigh each accepted complete uncoated leaf on a calibrated scale without transport packaging; reconcile drawing, configuration and acceptance record; retain each reading and sum as S. Dimensions measured with verified instruments. | kg | each leaf; campaign close | Complete declared campaign, with representative operating coverage | Named factory and configuration | per 1 kg reference flow | Calibration, source records and reconciled campaign ledger |
| cp_material | door_manufacture | wood, glue and abrasive inputs | foreground_record | supplier lot; species/origin; delivery state; withdrawals; opening/closing stock; wet/dry basis; moisture method; supplier formulation/SDS; glue solids/water; abrasive composition | Weigh and reconcile lot receipts, withdrawals and stocks by separate atomic material. Measure wood moisture on representative same-lot specimens with species-calibrated meters and oven-dry checks; glue properties from supplier and verified batch sampling, not assumed polymer concentration. Record ambient bonding conditions and cure acceptance. | kg | each lot and campaign | Complete declared campaign, with representative operating coverage | Named factory and configuration | per 1 kg reference flow | Calibration, source records and reconciled campaign ledger |
| cp_energy | door_manufacture | electricity | foreground_record | meter readings; service voltage; stage runtime/load; site supply; transformer losses; kWh; attribution driver; supplier background boundary | Use calibrated purchased-electricity meters and stage submeters for the campaign; reconcile totals and shared loads, including dust extraction and compressor use. Convert kWh to MJ without adding upstream supply losses twice. | MJ | continuous, campaign totals | Complete declared campaign, with representative operating coverage | Named factory and configuration | per 1 kg reference flow | Calibration, source records and reconciled campaign ledger |
| cp_pack | door_manufacture | each packaging input | foreground_record | packing bill; separate board/film/pallet masses; tare; return and trip records; dispatch quantity; scrap; stocks | Weigh each packaging material separately; reconcile withdrawals with dispatched protection, scrap and stock change. For reusable pallets retain physical transfer and return records and verified service-life attribution separately. | kg | each shipment | Complete declared campaign, with representative operating coverage | Named factory and configuration | per 1 kg reference flow | Calibration, source records and reconciled campaign ledger |
| cp_waste | door_manufacture | each waste output | foreground_record | row identity; pre/post glue stage; container tare; wet mass; moisture; attached glue/abrasive; destination; transfer note; rework stock | Weigh segregated waste containers, subtract tare and retain treatment transfer evidence. Separate clean offcut, untreated sawdust, glued dust, rejected leaf, PVAc residue, abrasive paper and each packaging scrap. Reconcile detached material once. | kg | each removal and campaign | Complete declared campaign, with representative operating coverage | Named factory and configuration | per 1 kg reference flow | Calibration, source records and reconciled campaign ledger |
| cp_air | door_manufacture | each elementary air emission | foreground_record | species/CAS; medium/submedium; stage; control device; sampling/airflow/time; size basis; detection limit; fugitive estimate and uncertainty; glue SDS | Collect outdoor discharge measurements after control with compatible sampling periods; include documented fugitive releases. Obtain separate species and disjoint dust-size totals. Acetic acid requires actual source identification and measurement. Unknown or below detection is disclosed, not an invented zero. | kg | representative operating conditions and campaign | Complete declared campaign, with representative operating coverage | Named factory and configuration | per 1 kg reference flow | Calibration, source records and reconciled campaign ledger |
| cp_water | door_manufacture | evaporated water | foreground_record | wood moisture before/after; glue input water; water in accepted leaf and wastes; stock change; ambient uptake; airflow/humidity cross-check | Determine net evaporated water from consistent campaign water balances, cross-checked by outlet airflow/humidity where feasible; record retained water and ambient uptake rather than treating all supplied glue water as vapor. | kg | each campaign | Complete declared campaign, with representative operating coverage | Named factory and configuration | per 1 kg reference flow | Calibration, source records and reconciled campaign ledger |

### Calculation Rules

| rule_id | Applies to | Formula or rule | Inputs | Output | source_ids |
| --- | --- | --- | --- | --- | --- |
| campaign_normalization | all inventory rows | For each non-reference row, normalized exchange = attributable physical campaign total / S; S is the sum of measured accepted net leaf masses in kg. Accepted_leaf = 1 kg. Apply the same campaign and configuration throughout. | cp_mass; cp_material; cp_energy; cp_pack; cp_waste; cp_air; cp_water | Exchange per 1 kg reference flow |  |
| wood_balance | hardwood, clean_offcut, clean_sawdust, glued_dust | Wood dry mass = wet wood mass / (1 + dry-basis moisture in percent / 100); use only the wood fraction of composite streams. Maintain unallocated dry-wood/water/carbon balances including stock changes; carbon fraction requires actual species/composition evidence, not a universal default. | cp_material; cp_waste; cp_water | Dry wood mass and physical balance | usda-wood-handbook-2021 |
| particle_partition | pmfine, pmmid, pmcoarse | If the same valid sample reports cumulative totals, middle fraction = PM10 − PM2.5 and coarse fraction = total suspended particles − PM10; require non-negative values, equal sampling/control bases and documented uncertainty. Add only disjoint fractions; never sum PM10 with its PM2.5 subset. | cp_air | Disjoint particle totals before campaign normalization |  |

### Data Quality Requirements

| requirement_id | Applies to | Requirement | Evidence |
| --- | --- | --- | --- |
| dq-route | door_manufacture | Verify actual solid leaf construction and complete door gate; retain excluded-operation checks and stage records. | Drawing, bill of materials, shop route and acceptance |
| dq-mass | all inventory rows | S must be positive and measured; report scale resolution/calibration, sampling coverage, period and denominator. Quantities, null values, detection limits and absence are distinct. | Traceable original campaign records |
| dq-background | all inventory rows | Confirm actual supplied composition, geographic/temporal representativeness and unit basis before linking backgrounds. Unresolved waste identities or supply compatibility remain explicit and block a complete dataset, not the future collection protocol. | Supplier declarations, state-confirmed identities, linked process boundaries |
| dq-functions | reference product | Area, thickness, adhesive, absence of cores/skins/coatings/hardware and functional claims require original evidence. Do not infer sound/fire certification from wood species or material mass. | Product schedule and test report matching configuration, or explicit no claim |

## 9. Validation Rules

| rule_id | applies_to | rule | source_ids |
| --- | --- | --- | --- |
| v-identity | reference product | Require exactly one completed accepted door-leaf product output linked by accepted_leaf, equal to 1 kg net mass. A frame, threshold, filled-core panel or packaged gross mass fails scope. | adk-solid-door-route |
| v-basis | all inventory rows | EN and ZH must preserve rows, quantities, S denominator, sources and formulas. Every row has one atomic flow, reference basis and named collection protocol; actual optional absence needs route evidence. |  |
| v-balance | door_manufacture | Reconcile physical mass/water/carbon and packaging ledgers before allocation. Check no duplicated internal handoffs, rework or captured-versus-emitted dust. Document discrepancy and measurement uncertainty; no invented closure amount. |  |
| v-emissions | pmfine, pmmid, pmcoarse, water_vapor, acetic_acid | Check species, CAS where relevant, outdoor air/submedium, size partition and actual control boundary. Preserve biogenic CO2 in linked upstream LCI and disclose impact-accounting conventions separately. No generic PM or correction flow substitutes a specific emission. |  |
| v-completeness | all inventory rows | Missing identity, incompatible supplier composition/units, unmeasured quantities or unknown flows make the concrete dataset incomplete. Add every evidenced additional exchange atomically; flow identity success alone does not approve quantities or background data. |  |

## 10. Published Dataset Profile

| Field | Value |
| --- | --- |
| dataset_role | secondary_dataset; background_dataset |
| downstream_use | Input for the specified uncoated interior solid hardwood door leaf, with linked upstream manufacture and disclosed finishing/installation outside this gate |
| allowed_use | Manufacturing comparison only after matching leaf geometry, configuration, moisture, performance, gates and complete supply data |
| excluded_use | Whole installed door sets; frames/thresholds; filled-core panels; certified fire/acoustic assemblies; universal per-door weight |
| required_metadata | Factory, campaign, S and accepted count, mass calibration, dimensions/species/route, glue formulation, claims and acceptance, boundary and backgrounds, packaging, allocation, UUID gaps |
| required_quality_disclosure | Measured/estimated/missing quantities, sampling and uncertainty, data age, supplier compatibility and outstanding identity or background gaps |
| update_trigger | Changed species, construction, adhesive, finishing, functional claim, meter boundary, energy route, waste destination or supplier background |
