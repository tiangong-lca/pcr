# Wood-lattice cellular board — dry-input UF electric-press manufacture

## 1. Scope and Applicability

This method covers factory manufacture of uncoated interior cellular wood panels whose skins are bonded to a frame and deliberately spaced coniferous wood laths, either parallel or in a lattice. The support core has designed cavities; continuous edge-glued solid strip cores are outside scope. Purchased kiln-dried coniferous lumber is cut into the core; purchased unbonded non-tropical hardwood veneer sheets not exceeding 6 mm form the skins. Powder UF adhesive is mixed with separately recorded water, and supplier-qualified solid ammonium chloride and wheat-flour extender when used. Press heating is electric. Separate rock-wool cavity infill is conditional on actual construction, not prescribed. Sources: `un-cpc-cellular-3`, `usda-wood-handbook-2021`.

Exclude solid blockboard/battenboard, all-veneer plywood, paper-honeycomb door cores, aluminium honeycomb, bamboo cores, foamed plastic cores, assembled doors/hardware, coated/preserved panels, purchased bonded skins, liquid premixed UF, other adhesive chemistries, raw-log conversion, on-site green-wood drying and fuel/steam/purchased-heat press routes. These require new physical inventory and applicability review. This recipe is an evidence-informed collection route; it is not an industry-average recipe, emission factor or claim of structural/fire/acoustic equivalence.

UN CPC 3.0 31610 identifies spaced wood laths, whereas the broader 31411 explanatory inclusion also mentions cellular board, and the 31421 title/note distinction does not settle every physical core. Resolve using the actual cross-section and bill of materials; retain classification overlap for maintainer mapping review. No method or accepted coverage of 3141/3142 is inferred from that wording. This route is a narrower proposal for 31610, not automatic accepted coverage. Sources: `un-cpc-cellular-3`, `un-cpc-plywood-3`, `un-cpc-laminated-3`.

## 4. Measurement and Unit Rules

| rule_id | Applies to | Required property | Required unit | Rule |
| --- | --- | --- | --- | --- |
| reference_mass | reference product | Mass `93a60a56-a3c8-11da-a746-0800200b9a66` | kg | B = total accepted net finished panel mass of the same design, site, lots and period; weigh on calibrated scales excluding packaging using cp_output. Inventory denominator is B, not input mass or dry wood mass. |
| panel_geometry | reference product | Mass; area; length | kg; m2; m | Measure each accepted panel area A and final thickness t with calibrated length/thickness tools; rho_app = B / sum(A*t). Area per 1 kg = sum(A)/B. Apparent envelope volume includes cavities and is never solid wood volume. Separate actual solid face, frame and lath volumes, avoid overlapping lattice joints, and measure infill independently. |
| wood_moisture | core_stock; face_veneer; residue ledger | Mass | kg | u = (m_wet - m_od) / m_od; m_od = m_wet / (1 + u). Determine representative material moisture by sealed samples and oven-dry weighing or a calibrated instrument checked against it, cp_wood. Do not confuse dry-basis u with wet-basis water fraction. Keep panel net mass B at actual moisture. Source: usda-wood-handbook-2021. |
| glue_component_basis | uf_powder; nh4cl; wheat_extender; mix_clean_water | Mass | kg | Record as-supplied mass, measured solids and separately added water per recipe batch; glue-contact spread uses actual wood/skin contact area, not total cavity envelope. Dry resin solids are a composition ledger, not a second exchange. No fixed recipe or supplier solids default. Source: usda-wood-handbook-2021. |
| electric_energy | electricity | Net calorific value | MJ | E_MJ = 3.6 * E_kWh; use matched customer-side electricity meters, cp_energy. The database energy label does not make electricity combustible fuel. MJ steam/heat alone never establishes useful delivered heat; a heat route needs supplier boundary and measured enthalpy balance before adoption. |

## 5. System Boundary

### Boundary Abstraction

| Field | Value |
| --- | --- |
| declared_starting_condition | Received kiln-dried coniferous sawn timber, unbonded non-tropical hardwood veneers and separately supplied listed recipe/packaging inputs |
| starting_condition_role | Purchased-input gate for foreground conversion |
| product_classification_scope | Physically spaced wood-core subset of cellular board; 31610 context with 3141/3142 overlap retained |
| recursive_input_rule | Purchased already bonded cellular panels are outside this production route; internal rework stays in the same ledger and never creates another completed reference output |
| upstream_dataset_requirement | Link verified input suppliers covering forestry, sawnwood/veneer manufacture and drying, chemical and packaging production, electricity and matched delivery gates. Foreground alone is not cradle-to-gate; missing links remain explicit |
| disclosure | Actual component species/state, treatment, suppliers/geography/year, meters, infill, utility route, delivery inclusion, loss and waste destinations |

| rule_id | applies_to | rule | source_ids |
| --- | --- | --- | --- |
| b_foreground | cellular_manufacture | Include receipt/conditioning, core ripping and frame/lattice assembly, powder UF mixing and spread, skin lay-up, electric pressing/cure, cooling, final conditioning, trimming, acceptance, packing and controls. Keep phase throughput and energy/waste measurements within one foreground unit. | usda-wood-handbook-2021 |
| b_route | cellular_manufacture | Exclude on-site combustion from this declared route. If actual fuel use, kiln drying, steam or purchased heat is present, expand the physical inventory and evidence before use; never hide it in electricity. Any biogenic CO2 actually emitted in an expanded route stays in LCI independently of an impact-reporting convention. |  |
| b_delivery | inbound_freight | Include actual inbound delivery either once in the matched supplier dataset or once as the specific freight exchange. Record delivery/treatment provider endpoints; missing supplier coverage is not a cutoff. Waste treatment burdens remain linked to actual destination. |  |
| b_identity | finished_panel | Physical core construction governs scope. Record photographs/cross-sections and separate skin/core/glue/infill bills. Classification words cannot substitute for a physical spaced wood support structure or accepted mapping. | un-cpc-cellular-3; un-cpc-plywood-3; un-cpc-laminated-3 |

## 6. Process Inventory Structure

### Process Map

| process_id | process_name | inclusion | inclusion_condition | role | quantitative_reference |
| --- | --- | --- | --- | --- | --- |
| cellular_manufacture | Dry-input wood-lattice cellular panel manufacture | required | Declared recipe/utility route | Foreground receipt through packaged gate, with net panel reference | 1 kg accepted net panel |

The physical sequence is receipt → cutting/frame and spaced-core assembly → skin/glue lay-up → press/cure → cooling/conditioning → trim/acceptance → packaging. Phase transfers are internal to this unit; preserve matched quantities on both sides of every handoff. Packaging follows acceptance without a second output with the same reference UUID. Track rework and glue/scrap/dust capture explicitly before burden attribution.

Only unbonded non-tropical non-coniferous veneer sheets not exceeding 6 mm for the two skins; keep face and back quantities separately in raw records and sum this one material exchange. Previously bonded plywood skins require a new applicability and identity assessment.

- Selected flow: Veneer sheets and sheets for plywood and other wood sawn lengthwise, sliced or peeled, of a thickness not exceeding 6 mm, of other non-coniferous wood `7a8c3cba-0c6b-422a-ac79-b7032d874bcb`

Record the purchased dry powder formulation and moisture/solids. Do not substitute an unspecified liquid UF resin record or create separate fictitious resin and carrier exchanges from a purchased premixed liquid glue.

- Selected flow: Dry powdered urea-formaldehyde adhesive resin
- Flow property / unit: Mass `93a60a56-a3c8-11da-a746-0800200b9a66`; unit group `93a60a57-a4c8-11da-a746-0800200c9a66` / kg

###### Ammonium Chloride (`nh4cl`)

Only separately supplied solid ammonium chloride used when the supplier-qualified powder recipe requires it. Weigh the salt; other hardeners require separate rows. The native Product/Mass identity has concordant ammonium-chloride name, CAS 12125-02-9 and crystalline-salt comment, but specifies an absorption-tower/chemical-treatment interface. It is used here only as a qualified foreground physical mass locator, not a verified delivered-hardener background. Independently establish the actual solid supply, purity, grade, moisture and provider boundary; the native interface alone does not establish compatibility with that delivered supply. Missing supply/provider evidence remains an explicit dataset gap.

- Specificity: `site_specific`
- Normalization basis: per 1 kg reference flow
- Basis kind: `reference_flow`
- Evidence kind: `collected_record`
- Collection protocol: `cp_recipe`

###### Wheat flour (`wheat_extender`)

Only separately added wheat flour when used in the qualified recipe. Record as-received moisture and mass; not wood flour, starch or an inferred universal addition. The native wheat-flour name and wheat-powder comment support this physical identity, but its CPC 23220 placement describes starches/inulin/wheat gluten/dextrins and is an unresolved source-classification inconsistency. This does not authorize starch or isolated gluten substitution. Retain the actual whole-flour composition, grade, moisture and compatible supplier/provider evidence; the UUID alone establishes none of those.

- Basis kind: `reference_flow`
- Evidence kind: `collected_record`

###### Process Water (`mix_clean_water`)

Purchased treated process water for mixing and cleaning. Submeter the two uses and reconcile stock; water already included in supplied materials is not a second purchased-water exchange.

- Selected flow: Process Water `94a04f7e-2d5c-41f0-b182-d54a3b373a02`

###### Alternating current (`electricity`)

Grid-average customer-side AC below 1 kV, including cutting, electric press heating, mixing, trimming, handling, ventilation and controls. Preserve stage submeters; no fuel, steam or purchased heat is hidden in this row.

###### rock wool (`rock_wool`)

Conditional separately supplied rock-wool cavity infill supported by the actual design and measured loading. Wooden laths remain the spaced support system. No paper, aluminium honeycomb or automatic acoustic/fire rating; no prescribed fill fraction.

- Selected flow: rock wool `4f1a182c-7b3b-11dd-ad8b-0800200c9a66`

- Collection protocol: `cp_pack`

###### Corrugated cardboard (`corrugated_pack`)

Only corrugated cardboard protective pads if used; this identity requires actual C-, E- or F-flute multilayer board with at least 80% fibre content, containing recycled material and recyclable. Verify grade, composition and delivered mass against the supplier specification; these identity limits are not default recipe fractions or assumed recycling credits. An incompatible grade requires a separately verified specific flow. This packaging material never establishes a paper-honeycomb core.

## 7. Allocation and Co-product Handling

| rule_id | applies_to | rule |
| --- | --- | --- |
| a_physical | all inventory rows | Maintain an unallocated process graph, dry wood/water/carbon ledger and physical external amounts first. Internal rework/captured dust never becomes a second final output. Never multiply physical product or coproduct mass by an allocation share. |
| a_subdivide | cellular_manufacture | Separate measurable product-specific phases and design cohorts before allocating joint environmental burdens. Shared meter attribution between lines requires observed phase energy/operating evidence, never a fabricated recipe average. |
| a_coproduct | sold_sawdust; waste_sawdust | Treat clean sawdust as a coproduct only with actual sale/function evidence, otherwise as waste. Preserve physical mass and equal lot identities. If unavoidable joint burdens cannot be related by a documented physical relation, use disclosed same-period net sales revenue shares for panels and that coproduct; retain a physical-basis sensitivity, prices, currency and zero/negative-price handling. |
| a_no_credit | waste outputs | Waste-treatment burden links follow the actual destination. Do not combine allocation with automatic avoided-fuel/recycling credits. A substitution scenario needs separately documented receiving function, quality, displacement and boundaries. |

For every protocol, the aggregation basis means the recorded physical total divided by the same cohort accepted net panel mass B. Retain unallocated raw totals, lot mass/area/thickness and destinations; the denominator is neither panel count nor cavity volume.

### Calculation Rules

| rule_id | Applies to | Formula or rule | Inputs | Output | source_ids |
| --- | --- | --- | --- | --- | --- |
| batch_reference | all inventory rows | x_norm = sum(x_physical) / B; retain raw exchange totals for the matched accepted panel cohort; never apply burden shares to these physical totals. The finished reference output is 1 kg. | x_physical; B; cp_output | x_norm |  |
| geometry_conversion | finished_panel | A_norm = sum(A) / B; V_envelope_norm = sum(A*t) / B. Solid wood volume is the measured sum of actual skins, frame and laths minus overlapping joints. V_void is the remaining designed cavity envelope; record actual infill separately. No solid-wood-density multiplication of V_envelope or V_void. | A; t; B; component dimensions; cp_output; cp_wood; cp_filler | measured mass-area-thickness relation |  |
| material_water_carbon | cellular_manufacture | Before burden allocation, reconcile whole-stream mass and elemental carbon separately: opening stock + inputs = closing stock + outputs + reported residual, using actual composition and all relevant boundary crossings. Chemical reactions do not generate or consume total elemental carbon. Separately reconcile molecular H2O and reactive wood/resin components using opening stock + inputs + evidenced formation = closing stock + outputs + evidenced consumption + reported residual. Quantify only actual cure/thermal/oxidation pathways and extent; phase changes are transfers, not reactions. A zero reaction term requires evidence of absence; unknown extent remains unresolved, with no assumed full cure, generic yield or balancing emission. Track retained binder/additives and wood versus fossil carbon separately. Internal transfers cancel only with matched endpoints; measured outputs containing reaction products are counted once. Keep uncertainty explicit and do not apply burden shares to physical outputs. Use measured or traceable species/composition carbon fractions, not a universal default; missing volatile species and residual mass must not be assigned automatically to water vapour. | cp_output; cp_wood; cp_recipe; cp_residue; cp_water; cp_air | unallocated physical balances | usda-wood-handbook-2021 |
| disjoint_particles | pm25; pm25_10; pm_over10 | For matched tests, PM_2.5_10 = PM10 - PM2.5 and PM_over10 = total_PM - PM10, only when sampling boundaries are compatible. Physical particulate mass is the sum of the three disjoint fractions. Do not add nested total_PM or PM10 again; negative differences require review rather than clamping to zero. | matched total_PM; PM10; PM2.5; cp_air | disjoint particulate exchanges |  |
| burden_attribution | cellular_manufacture | Keep a separate burden ledger. For documented economic allocation of unavoidable joint burdens only, f_j = revenue_j / sum(revenue_j); assigned burden_j = f_j * joint burden plus product-specific burden. Keep all physical outputs unchanged; disclose sensitivity and actual sales basis. | joint burden; product-specific burden; sales; cp_residue | separate attributed burden ledger |  |

### Data Quality Requirements

| requirement_id | Applies to | Requirement | Evidence |
| --- | --- | --- | --- |
| dq_boundary | all inventory rows | Retain actual cross-section/BOM, delivery endpoints, identity/property/unit matches, species, treated state, supplier/time and complete measurement scope. UUID identity alone does not establish a usable provider. | Actual raw records and scope/uncertainty disclosure |
| dq_primary | all inventory rows | Collect site data under the declared protocols before dataset completion. No synthetic values, literature-to-industry extrapolation or default recipe. Record missing/under-detection observations and whether each conditional row is absent or unresolved. | Actual raw records and scope/uncertainty disclosure |
| dq_units | all inventory rows | B, lot cohort and moisture/area/thickness basis must match. Keep calibration, repeat measurements, uncertainties, disjoint PM size definitions, concentration and wet/dry corrections. Supply actual provider conversions; secondary database property coefficients are not measured density. | Actual raw records and scope/uncertainty disclosure |
| dq_completeness | cellular_manufacture | List omitted operations, unmatched suppliers, additional real ingredients/consumables/packaging/wastes/species and their material significance. Add atomic exchanges before use when these occur. No all-tools-failed or unsupported measurement result can certify completeness. | Actual raw records and scope/uncertainty disclosure |

## 9. Validation Rules

| rule_id | applies_to | rule |
| --- | --- | --- |
| v_construction | finished_panel | Require spaced wooden parallel/lattice support and separate skins, glue and optional infill. Reject solid blockboard, paper/aluminium honeycomb and complete doors even when a label says cellular board. |
| v_reference | all inventory rows | Exactly one completed reference product output equals 1 kg net panel; all amounts and protocol aggregation are per the same 1 kg reference flow. Missing UUIDs stay unresolved, not replaced with near products or hidden identities. |
| v_balances | cellular_manufacture | Audit unallocated physical transfers and separate dry-wood, water and carbon balances before inspecting burden allocation. Cavities never become solid wood volume. Internal link quantities must agree; rejects, stock and rework cannot vanish. |
| v_air | pm25; pm25_10; pm_over10; formaldehyde; methanol; water_vapour | Verify exact substance/size/medium and post-control release basis. No correction flows, total VOC proxy, nested-PM double count or indoor-to-outdoor substitution. Keep biogenic and fossil origins separate whenever actual carbon exchanges are added. |
| v_readiness | all inventory rows | A dataset is incomplete when actual flow/provider identity, quantities, useful-heat basis, source scope or measurement relationships are unresolved. State performed/skipped checks and uncertainty. Classification acceptance and scientific review are separate decisions. |

## 10. Published Dataset Profile
