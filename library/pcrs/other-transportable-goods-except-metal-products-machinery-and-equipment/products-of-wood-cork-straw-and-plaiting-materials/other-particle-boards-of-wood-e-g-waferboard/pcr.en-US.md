# Uncoated randomly laid PF-bonded wood waferboard

## 1. Scope and Applicability

Applies to finished uncoated, unpreserved wood waferboard made from broad thin flakes with declared geometry and randomly falling layup, bonded with powdered uncured PF resole under heat and pressure. No deliberately oriented face or cross-oriented layer architecture is allowed; incidental alignment from gravity is disclosed and measured. The supported pilot uses externally supplied steam for indirect drying/press heating, electric handling and dry dust collection. Onsite combustion, direct-fired drying, thermal oxidation, wet scrubbers, sanding, coatings/overlays, fire retardants, preservatives, other binders and wax emulsions require separate applicability and inventory review. [epa-waferboard-2002; usda-waferboard-types-1986]

Wafer width, length, thickness and orientation distribution distinguish the product from fine-particle UF particleboard and long narrow deliberately layered OSB. Broad use of the word particleboard in historical technical literature includes waferboard; that linguistic overlap does not make these production methods interchangeable. Oriented waferboard and an Aspenite trade name are insufficient to establish this random architecture. [usda-waferboard-types-1986; epa-waferboard-2002]

Real product anchors are the photographed wide-wafer board in FPL-GTR-53, Figure 2, printed p.5, and commercial Canadian powder-resin waferboards W1–W7 in FPL-RP-574, Table 1, printed p.2 (1985 samples, reported 1999). The latter report calls these minimally aligned waferboards and includes W4 from Ontario. These are product-existence evidence, not a claim that W4 has this PF chemistry, species, fully random manufacturing settings or steam route. Those facts must be established for the actual site. Historical grades, test dimensions and strengths are not present-day defaults or legal acceptance criteria. No universal wafer dimension, moisture, recipe, density, service life or energy/emission factor is assigned. [usda-commercial-panels-1999; usda-waferboard-types-1986]

## 3. Reference Flow

| Field | Value |
| --- | --- |
| What | Supply an accepted random-wafer wood board material; no assumed equal structural service to OSB or UF board |
| How much | 1 kg net accepted finished waferboard at factory gate, excluding packaging |
| How well | Actual broad wafer geometry/orientation, powdered PF formulation, declared grade, thickness, density and dispatch moisture with method |
| How long or cycle | One production accounting period; no use-stage service life assigned |
| reference_flow_link | `finished_waferboard` |

| Field | Value |

| Reference amount | 1 |
| Reference product flow | Other particle boards of wood (e.g. waferboard) `dc4d3259-45c1-4d98-8264-35a90058e65c` |
| Reference flow property | Mass `93a60a56-a3c8-11da-a746-0800200b9a66` |

| Reference unit | kg |
| Required qualifiers | Site/period and gate; botanical species mix and log/bark state; wafer length/width/thickness distribution and random orientation evidence; actual PF supplier/formulation/solids/cure suitability; neat wax grade if used; board grade and actual acceptance standard/tests; panel dimensions/net mass/density; moisture basis/method; uncoated/unpreserved state; indirect steam definition, electricity voltage, dust controls, packaging and residue destinations |

Declare all required qualifiers in the concrete data package. The finished-class UUID includes this physical subset and identifies a mass exchange; it does not establish a grade, wafer architecture, supplier inventory or compatibility of an unrelated background dataset.

## 4. Measurement and Unit Rules

| rule_id | Applies to | Required property | Required unit | Rule |
| --- | --- | --- | --- | --- |
| reference_mass | reference product | Mass | kg | Calibrated net accepted dispatch board mass in cp_reference, excluding packaging and rejects. |
| same_denominator | all inventory rows | Reference product mass | kg | Every row uses per 1 kg reference flow; sum actual attributable period totals and divide by Q, the net accepted finished-board mass from cp_reference. |
| moisture_basis | wood and board | Mass | kg | For untreated wood collect wet and ovendry mass: u=(wet-dry)/dry, dry=wet/(1+u). Distinguish percent from fractions and wet-basis moisture. For bonded panels use a validated moisture method distinguishing water loss from volatile/cure losses; wood dry mass excludes binder/wax solids. [usda-wood-moisture-2021] |
| energy_basis | electricity, steam, condensate | Energy and mass | MJ; kg | Meter electricity at the declared voltage; 1 kWh = 3.6 MJ. Steam inventory uses measured kg and a separate net enthalpy account from inlet/return/loss states. Match supplier background delivery and return credit definitions before linkage. |

## 5. System Boundary

### Boundary Abstraction

| Field | Value |
| --- | --- |
| declared_starting_condition | Receiving gate for untreated coniferous/non-coniferous panel logs with recorded bark and moisture; electric in-yard handling |
| starting_condition_role | foreground_entry |
| product_classification_scope | Physical random-wafer PF pilot subset of CPC 3.0 31439 |
| recursive_input_rule | Purchased finished waferboard is not raw log furnish. Internal wafers, mats, rework and dust returns stay in stage transfer/stock records; one final finished reference output only. |
| upstream_dataset_requirement | Matching log forestry/preparation and receiving freight; powdered PF/wax, electricity at stated voltage, delivered steam with agreed return convention, water and packaging supply; each external waste treatment. All upstream combustion emissions remain in linked inventories. |
| disclosure | Gate-to-gate foreground plus explicit upstream links for cradle-to-gate use. Installation, use and end of life are separately modelled. Disclose capital equipment/cut-offs and any missing supply activity. |

Use one integrated foreground unit p_wafer through packing. Preserve independent stage records s_receive (yard/thaw/debark/crosscut), s_wafer (waferizing), s_dry (indirect drying and screening), s_blend (powder PF/neat wax), s_form (gravity random forming), s_press, s_finish (cooling/trim), s_pack and s_control (dry collection/cleaning). Internal transfer pairs must agree in actual quantity and state; no intermediate board shares the final reference UUID. [epa-waferboard-2002]

| rule_id | applies_to | rule | source_ids |
| --- | --- | --- | --- |
| b_route | p_wafer | Verify the full declared route. Direct-fired dryers, onsite fuel-burning boilers/RTOs, wet controls, sanding and surface treatments are outside this pilot and cannot disappear behind purchased-heat wording; review and add their exact inventories before applying an expanded method. | epa-waferboard-2002 |
| b_stack | p_wafer | Record outlet emissions after actual dry controls once per stack/source. Capture is a solid residue, not an atmospheric release. Dryer, press/cooling and trim sources remain separately traceable. | epa-waferboard-2002 |
| b_heat | steam, condensate | External steam generation is upstream. Include physical incoming steam, returned condensate, actual losses and net enthalpy reconciliation; do not additionally book provider fuel as onsite fuel or create an unmetered heat export. | epa-waferboard-2002 |

## 7. Allocation and Co-product Handling

| rule_id | applies_to | rule | source_ids |
| --- | --- | --- | --- |
| a_separate | p_wafer | Keep the unallocated physical mass/water/carbon/energy account and internal transfers separately from the product-attributed environmental-burden account. Coproduct physical mass remains actual mass. | ghg-allocation-2011 |
| a_hierarchy | p_wafer | Use stage/source metering to avoid allocation. For remaining common burdens demonstrate a causal physical relationship; dry mass is admissible only when justified. Otherwise document consistent period-specific economic relationships and sensitivity; disclose prices and markets, with no automatic zero value or avoided-fuel credit. | ghg-allocation-2011 |
| a_residue | bark, fines, bark_waste, fines_waste | Classify each actual residue lot as sold coproduct, internal return or waste using destination evidence. These quantities are exclusive. Resin-bound residues stay distinct from unresinated wood and require their own treatment datasets. | epa-waferboard-2002 |

| cp_emission | p_wafer | each species and particle fraction | outlet_sampling | row_id; source/stage; control; species/CAS; phase; outlet gas flow; concentration; wet/dry/standard conditions; time; detection limit; filterable/condensable basis | Representative controlled-outlet tests plus run-hour/flow records, with fugitive estimates separately justified; verify three nonoverlapping filterable PM fractions and VOC/condensable overlap; Aggregation calculation: Each species/fraction integrated physical mass / Q; per 1 kg reference flow; no second shared-stack count | kg | representative campaigns and each recipe/control change | all declared operating regimes and seasonality | same site and controlled outlet | per 1 kg reference flow | test method; detection/uncertainty; control/run logs |

### Calculation Rules

| rule_id | Applies to | Formula or rule | Inputs | Output | source_ids |
| --- | --- | --- | --- | --- | --- |
| period_normalization | all inventory rows | For each actual physical exchange use its attributable period total divided by Q; the finished output is exactly 1 kg. Q is positive net accepted wet dispatch mass. | Q; period totals; cp_reference | each exchange per 1 kg reference flow | epa-waferboard-2002 |
| dry_wood_account | conifer_logs, hardwood_logs | For each untreated wood batch dry wood = wet wood/(1+u); water = wet wood-dry wood. Retain separate binder/wax solids and carbon origins in the board and wastes; do not equate oven-dry board with dry wood. | wet mass; dry-basis u; cp_material | physical dry matter and water ledgers | usda-wood-moisture-2021 |
| steam_enthalpy | steam, condensate | Net delivery enthalpy = incoming mass × inlet enthalpy minus returned mass × return enthalpy minus other outgoing stream enthalpies minus increase in stored energy, with explicit common datum. Resolve heat loss, vents and useful stage heat separately. Supplier return credits require its background convention; neither incoming steam mass nor catalog energy unit alone is net useful heat. | inlet/return/outgoing states; mass; stock; cp_steam | reconciled energy account and compatible steam linkage | epa-waferboard-2002 |
| pm_partition | pm25, pmcoarse, pmover10, condensable_pm | For paired compatible filterable measurements: fine=PM2.5; coarse=PM10-PM2.5; large=total filterable PM-PM10. All are nonnegative; uncertainty and matching sampling conditions are mandatory. Do not add cumulative PM10/total again. Condensable measurements and molecular VOC mass remain phase-resolved without duplication. | paired outlet tests; cp_emission | disjoint physical particulate and molecular species inventory | epa-waferboard-2002 |
| physical_closure | p_wafer | For the same period and boundary, whole-stream mass obeys opening stock + external inputs = finished board + actual coproducts + waste + elementary releases + closing stock; include relevant gas-side mass exchanges where present. Elemental accounts obey the same equation for each relevant element, including C/H/O, with biogenic/fossil carbon origins separate; reactions do not generate mass or elements. Molecular H2O and each defined reactive species/material class j instead obey opening_j + inputs_j + formation_j = outputs_j + closing_j + consumption_j, using consistent component definitions, units and scope. Determine formation/consumption from actual formulation, composition and measured or independently validated reaction extent: PF press condensation changes resin solids and forms water; a separately reviewed biological-control expansion transforms organics into water, CO2, biomass and other actual products with oxygen uptake. Do not impose external-only dry-matter/H2O closure, full cure, complete degradation or universal yields. Keep supplied/carrier water, reaction water, evaporation and the utility steam/return circuit distinct; phase transfers do not create H2O. Internal transfer endpoints agree and cancel at plant level. Report unexplained residuals and propagated uncertainty without treating residuals as reaction evidence. Matched internal handoffs require the same measured quantity and physical/chemical state at both endpoints. | all stream totals; stock; elemental/component composition; actual reaction extent; cp_material; cp_water; cp_residue; cp_emission; cp_steam | unallocated whole-mass/element and reaction-aware component accounts | epa-waferboard-2002; conner-wood-adhesives-2001 |
| burden_attribution | p_wafer | Attribute direct burdens first. Apply justified allocation shares only to remaining common environmental burdens, with shares summing to one for the same scope. Preserve all physical product quantities; product-attributed burden divided by Q forms the downstream dataset. | direct/common burdens; allocation drivers; cp_allocation; Q | separate product-attributed burden account | ghg-allocation-2011 |

### Data Quality Requirements

| requirement_id | Applies to | Requirement | Evidence |
| --- | --- | --- | --- |
| dq_identity | p_wafer | Verify actual wood-wafer geometry/random architecture, uncured PF recipe, product acceptance and exclusions. A trade name or class label is insufficient. | forming logs; geometry photos/tests; supplier certificates |
| dq_coverage | all inventory rows | Cover a complete representative operating period and all measured regimes; distinguish measured zero, below detection, absence and missing measurement. Missing UUID or supplier quantity/background compatibility remains explicit; complete datasets cannot silently substitute. Define water, dry solids and reactive components consistently; support reaction terms with actual composition/extent evidence and reconcile to whole mass/elements. Oven loss, stock corrections and unexplained residuals do not prove reaction water; unresolved terms prevent a complete component-balance claim. | row coverage; calibration; uncertainty; supplier definitions; formulation/cure records; component and elemental accounts |
| dq_limits | p_wafer | Historical EPA/FPL sources supply method context only. Do not transfer softwood-sawmill CORRIM quantities, sawmill dust factors or boiler factors to waferboard indirect drying/pressing. Add individual rows for additional actual exchanges and retain phase-specific emissions. | scope/route comparison; site screening; original methods |

## 9. Validation Rules

| rule_id | applies_to | rule | source_ids |
| --- | --- | --- | --- |
| v_reference | finished_waferboard | Exactly one finished reference output has 1 kg net accepted board; Q is positive and every row/protocol uses the same denominator. Reject duplicate reference intermediates, packaged-mass denominators and mismatched EN/ZH definitions. | epa-waferboard-2002 |
| v_architecture | p_wafer | Require broad-thin wafer geometry and nondeliberate random forming proof, actual PF chemistry/grade and declared heat/control route. Reject long-strand oriented OSB, fine UF particleboard and excluded variants. | usda-waferboard-types-1986 |
| v_balance | p_wafer | Before burden allocation audit whole-stream mass, relevant elements including C/H/O with origin-separated carbon, reaction-aware H2O/reactive-component accounts and the separate energy account; transfer pairs agree. Require actual composition/cure extent and justified formation/consumption terms, not external-only dry-matter/water closure or a residual-based cure yield. Do not presume full cure or zero reaction water; unresolved terms require review and prevent a complete balance claim. Any biological-control expansion requires separate applicability review and actual gas/liquid/media/biomass and degradation evidence. Supplier steam conventions, voltage, PF/wax state and missing identities must be resolved before a complete linked dataset is claimed. | usda-wood-moisture-2021; epa-waferboard-2002; conner-wood-adhesives-2001 |
| v_emission | p_wafer | Use controlled-outlet species/phase quantities once, with nonoverlapping PM bins. Retain actual biogenic and fossil CO2 in upstream LCI and any separately reviewed onsite-combustion expansion; a GHG reporting convention cannot remove biogenic CO2 from the physical inventory. Disclose unmeasured species and do not claim complete coverage. | epa-waferboard-2002 |

| excluded_use | Generic other-board or OSB/UF proxy; structural-service equivalence; current legal/grade certification; incomplete UUID/steam/PF/wax background links |
| required_metadata | Required qualifiers; site/period; upstream gates; methods; all flow quantities and identities; physical balance and allocation accounts; original source locators |
| required_quality_disclosure | Missing/conditional rows, detection/uncertainty, identity versus quantity/background compatibility, exclusions, representativeness and historical-source limits |
| update_trigger | Species/wafer architecture, PF/wax supply, product grade, steam/electricity boundary, controls, destination, missing identity or site-period changes |
