# PF-bonded woven bamboo mat plywood

## 1. Scope and Applicability

This PCR covers unoverlaid flat panels made by impregnating untreated woven bamboo-sliver mats with purchased aqueous phenol-formaldehyde (PF) adhesive, squeezing surplus glue, maturing or redrying, assembling, hot pressing, cooling and edging. The starting material is a purchased, unglued woven mat, not a finished bamboo board. The panel is accepted and packaged at the manufacturing gate. Indirect purchased steam heat or electric heating is permitted; onsite fuel combustion, flue-gas direct drying and onsite wastewater treatment are outside this bounded route. Such sites require an extended methodology and complete utility/treatment inventories, rather than deletion of those burdens.

FAO distinguishes bamboo mat plywood, curtain plywood, strip plywood, paper-overlaid panels and bamboo particleboard as real products. Its China report is January 1998; the India report is August 1997 and records commercialization and subsequent constraints, not modern manufacturing parameters. ITTO's June 2014 Appendix 1 compiles INBAR 2002 mat-board technology; it is technical route evidence, not independent experimental validation. No historical recipe, resin uptake, drying temperature, press schedule, density, market volume or factory mean is prescribed as a present-day inventory value. [fao-china-bamboo-1998; fao-india-mat-board-1997; itto-woven-mat-2014]

Exclude parallel bamboo-curtain layers, glued strip lamination, crushed/fibrillated strand-woven scrimber, flattened culm boards, wood/bamboo composites, particle/fibre boards, UF/MUF/isocyanate bonding, overlays, coatings and preservative/bleaching/carbonization/steaming/boiling pretreatment. The 31212 unglued single-culm continuously shaped strip method supplies a different product and cannot model PF bonding. A boiling/freeze/drying product test described in ITTO is a quality test, not proof of production boiling. INBAR separates strip lamination and compression; those routes cannot be pooled into one bamboo exchange. [itto-woven-mat-2014; inbar-industrial-bamboo-2015]

Drying and hot pressing do not establish carbon neutrality. If any upstream mat treatment is discovered, declare it, link the actual treated-material provider and reassess applicability; do not relabel carbonized mats as untreated or assume thermal treatment removes biogenic or resin fossil carbon.

## 3. Reference Flow

| Field | Value |
| --- | --- |
| What | Provide an accepted unoverlaid PF woven-mat bamboo panel at the factory gate |
| How much | 1 m3 net solid geometrical panel volume, excluding packaging and stack voids |
| How well | Declare measured panel dimensions, moisture and density, PF formulation/solids, layer/weave construction, bond-test and grade acceptance records; no invented legal grade |

| Reference product flow | Bamboo Man-made Board `7bc26db5-b0aa-410d-93ee-1c96d34336ba` |
| Reference flow property | Volume `93a60a56-a3c8-22da-a746-0800200c9a66` |
| Reference unit group | Units of volume `93a60a57-a3c8-12da-a746-0800200c9a66` |
| Reference unit | m3 |
| Required qualifiers | PF resin and measured solids/wet basis; woven sliver mats only; untreated input; bamboo species; weave and layer count; dimensions and tolerances; dispatch moisture method/basis and measured density; unoverlaid/uncoated surface; grade and test acceptance; utility route/receiving voltage; supplier boundaries; net packaging exclusion |

All required qualifiers must appear in dataset metadata, product description or equivalent records. The broad board identity explicitly includes bamboo mat plywood; it does not prove a background dataset for this subset.

## 4. Measurement and Unit Rules

| rule_id | Applies to | Required property | Required unit | Rule |
| --- | --- | --- | --- | --- |
| reference_volume | reference product | Volume `93a60a56-a3c8-22da-a746-0800200c9a66` | m3 | Use cp_output: sum accepted final length × width × thickness in metres at measured dispatch moisture. Exclude rejected panels, rework, packaging and inter-panel voids. Retain actual net mass and measured moisture; no assumed density. |
| same_denominator | all inventory rows | Declared reference volume | m3 | Every inventory value and collection aggregation is per reference flow (1 m3 accepted final panel). Campaign records are divided by the same accepted volume V; retain absolute physical ledgers before attribution. |
| moisture_state | mat_input; finished_panel; offcuts | Mass | kg | Distinguish dry-basis and wet-basis moisture. Record laboratory method, specimen, conditioning and volatile/resin interference for each matrix; apparent oven loss from cured PF panels is not automatically water or bamboo loss. |
| resin_basis | pf_resin | Mass | kg | Weigh actual complete wet delivered adhesive in its verified complete-product reference basis. Measure solids, water and free-species composition; maintain dry-resin subledger. Require a specific compatible whole-formulation identity/provider including supplier manufacture/preparation/delivery; a generic resin UUID or dry-solids conversion cannot stand for whole wet adhesive kg. Link background only after the complete supplied product and its quantity basis are reconciled; no universal solids percentage. |
| steam_basis | steam | Net delivered heat | MJ | Record cp_heat supply/return enthalpy reference, pressure, temperature, dryness, steam mass and losses. A calorific-value property or MJ label alone cannot define net heat. Unverified quantities/provider definitions remain unavailable. |
| carbon_origins | co2_bio; co2_fossil | Mass | kg | Quantify dry bamboo biogenic carbon and PF/release/LDPE fossil carbon independently with measured fractions and stock changes. Thermal coloration is not carbon removal or neutralization. Unclassified carbon prevents a complete carbon balance. |

## 5. System Boundary

### Boundary Abstraction

| Field | Value |
| --- | --- |
| declared_starting_condition | Purchased unglued woven mats and aqueous PF adhesive received; measured moisture, no thermal/chemical pretreatment |
| starting_condition_role | Declared foreground cut at received constituents, with upstream production and inbound transport linked separately |
| product_classification_scope | PF woven-mat flat panel subset of CPC 3.0 31450; classification does not define all included routes |
| recursive_input_rule | Purchased finished panel in the same category is an explicit upstream input and not virgin mat. Internal uncured mat/board rework is counted once as stock/transfer; do not recursively repeat this PCR |
| upstream_dataset_requirement | Actual bamboo cultivation/harvest, sliver manufacture, weaving and inbound transport; PF manufacture and delivery; electricity supply; verified steam production/delivery/condensate-return convention; water, release and wrapping supply; destination-specific waste treatment |
| disclosure | Site, campaign, species, starting states, all transfers/stock, preprocessing, direct/indirect heat, provider definitions, exclusions, unreconciled balances and unlinked rows |

| rule_id | applies_to | rule | source_ids |
| --- | --- | --- | --- |
| boundary_route | p_panel | Include receiving, initial drying, resin dipping and squeezing, maturation/redrying, layup/pressing, cooling, edging/testing, wrapping, clean-up and pollution controls. Aggregate these stages into one foreground process; preserve each physical handoff and stage meter in cp_handoff. Do not export an intermediate board with the final reference UUID. | itto-woven-mat-2014 |
| boundary_inputs | p_panel | Upstream supplier burdens and waste destinations must match the actual material states. Bought mats do not eliminate cultivation/sliver/weaving burdens. A matching flow identity is not a complete background provider. | itto-woven-mat-2014 |
| boundary_utilities | p_panel | No onsite combustion or direct flue-gas drying is covered. Imported net steam heat includes its actual generation/distribution burdens via a separately verified provider; do not append provider boiler emissions to panel exhaust. Disclose capital-equipment exclusion, infrastructure sensitivity and all operating losses. | itto-woven-mat-2014 |
| boundary_carbon | p_panel | Keep actual biological/fossil carbon transfers and emissions. No foreground atmospheric uptake is introduced merely by purchasing bamboo. Storage is separately reported; no generic carbon-neutral label, future combustion credit or delayed-emission correction replaces physical flows. | inbar-industrial-bamboo-2015 |

## 6. Process Inventory Structure

### Process Map

| process_id | process_name | inclusion | inclusion_condition | role | quantitative_reference |
| --- | --- | --- | --- | --- | --- |
| p_panel | PF woven-mat panel manufacture | required | Defined untreated mat/PF route | Foreground stage aggregation with original physical handoffs | 1 m3 accepted finished panel |

The physical route is received woven mats → moisture-equalized mats → PF-wet impregnated mats after squeezing → matured/redried layup → hot-pressed board → cooled/edged accepted panel. These are different measured states of in-process material, not external product outputs. Use matched lot/transfer ids and identical sending/receiving quantities; measure water, bamboo dry matter, resin solids, free species, reject and rework at each handoff. Keep absolute mass/water/carbon balances separate from attributed environmental burdens. Only finished_panel is the reference output. [itto-woven-mat-2014]

Each card is one exchange. Conditional absence needs actual route/stock/test evidence; unmeasured is not zero. These rows are a minimum for the declared route; additional chemicals, packages, maintenance consumables or measured pollutants must each receive their own atomic row and identity review before a dataset can be called complete.

## 7. Allocation and Co-product Handling

| rule_id | applies_to | rule | source_ids |
| --- | --- | --- | --- |
| allocation_subdivide | p_panel | Separate lots/routes and stage meters before attributing burdens to this panel. In-scope accepted panels receive their measured activities and associated losses. Allocate common utilities only from a documented causal meter/engineering relation; retain unallocated site totals and sensitivity. | itto-woven-mat-2014 |
| allocation_residues | p_panel | Rejects, bonded offcuts, captured dust, adhesive purge and film scrap are waste in the default route; include their destination-specific treatment burdens without avoided-product credits. If a genuinely sold coproduct exists, first establish its distinct state/identity and quantity, subdivide and document the justified remaining allocation method for independent review. Waste value alone does not establish product function. | itto-woven-mat-2014 |
| allocation_physical | p_panel | Preserve physical input/output and internal transfer quantities before allocation. An attribution fraction applies to environmental burdens, not mechanically to a measured coproduct mass or stock change. Do not multiply both ends of a physical link differently. | itto-woven-mat-2014 |

### Calculation Rules

| rule_id | Applies to | Formula or rule | Inputs | Output | source_ids |
| --- | --- | --- | --- | --- | --- |
| campaign_volume | all inventory rows | V = sum(n_j × L_j × W_j × T_j), using accepted panel lots with metre dimensions; a_i = Q_i / V. Keep original campaign Q_i, stock adjustments and uncertainty; all inventory cards and protocols use the same 1 m3 reference denominator. | Accepted dimensions/count; Q_i; cp_output | a_i per 1 m3 | itto-woven-mat-2014 |
| moisture_conversion | mat_input; finished_panel; offcuts | For measured water-only fractions: u_d = m_water / m_dry; u_w = m_water / m_wet; m_wet = m_dry + m_water; u_w = u_d / (1 + u_d). For bonded panels distinguish bamboo dry matter from resin solids and other non-water matter; do not use apparent oven loss as water without matrix validation. | Component masses and water-specific assays | Separate dry-matter/water quantities | itto-woven-mat-2014 |
| pf_stock_balance | pf_resin; pf_waste | Q_wet = external wet-adhesive receipts + opening wet PF stock - closing wet PF stock - external wet returns. Build a separate solids balance using each lot's measured solids fraction and stock composition: incoming formulation solids are reconciled to retained cured solids, waste solids, stock change and identified cure-derived losses, including validated reaction products. Never equate wet Q_wet to dry retained resin. Squeeze recirculation is not a second purchase; no universal solids fraction or assumed cure loss. | cp_resin; cp_handoff; cp_waste; measured s | PF consumption and component ledger | itto-woven-mat-2014 |
| heat_enthalpy | steam | Net steam heat is the measured supply enthalpy flow minus the measured condensate/other return enthalpy flow across the declared utility-service boundary, using a common thermodynamic reference and validated states; document vent and distribution losses and provider treatment. Unknown states cannot be converted from mass to MJ or aligned to a generic calorific-value row. | cp_heat; measured supply/return mass and enthalpy | Net utility heat and correspondence | itto-woven-mat-2014 |
| particulate_bins | pm25; pmcoarse; pmover10 | For identical paired tests, E_2_5 = PM2.5; E_2_5_10 = PM10 - PM2.5; E_over10 = PMtotal - PM10. Retain test cut and filterable/condensable coverage; do not add cumulative PM10/PMtotal to the three bins. Unmatched tests or negative differences are unresolved. | cp_pm matched tests | Disjoint outdoor particulate emissions | epa-plywood-2002 |
| carbon_balance | co2_bio; co2_fossil | C_bio,in = dry bamboo mass × measured biomass carbon fraction. C_fossil,in = sum(each dry fossil-bearing constituent mass × its measured carbon fraction). For each origin separately, C_in + C_open = C_product + C_waste + C_close + C_actual_air_or_water. For actual CO2 only, carbon mass = CO2 mass × 12/44. Track organic species and particulate carbon without counting them again as CO2; unknown source attribution remains incomplete. Do not infer CO2 from an unexplained balance residual. | cp_carbon; cp_handoff; cp_air; cp_waste; cp_pack | Separate biogenic/fossil carbon balances and storage | inbar-industrial-bamboo-2015 |

The balance identities and collection/normalization requirements above are this PCR's declared measurement protocol, not measured factory results from the cited reports. Dimensionless factors, carbon fractions, supply enthalpies, gas/concentration corrections, emission factors and allocation shares must be backed by actual assays, validated methods and provider records. No first dataset values or industry parameter ranges are supplied.
| complete_period_normalization | all inventory rows | Every existing campaign, batch or lot amount rule and linked collection protocol uses one documented complete reporting-period pool for the same declared product, grade, route, configuration, site and reference state. Accepted-lot wording identifies the denominator only; retain all attributable startup, shutdown, wholly failed or zero-output batches, rejects, work in progress and rework in the raw native-unit numerator records. Count reworked reference product once only when finally accepted. Sum each attributable exchange over this matched pool, divide once by its strictly positive accepted reference-product quantity in the declared denominator unit, and scale to the declared reference quantity. Do not average batch ratios, drop a failed batch, pool unrelated products/periods or replace native numerator units. If the entire matched pool has no accepted output, retain the unnormalized absolute inventory and require review; issue no normalized result or fabricated output. Preserve stock/return and physical-transfer ledgers independently of burden allocation; allocation never removes already-incurred failed/rework activity. | all linked raw collection protocols; accepted reference-product pool; stock and rework links | native exchange unit per declared reference quantity; zero-output pool remains unnormalized |  |

### Data Quality Requirements

| requirement_id | Applies to | Requirement | Evidence |
| --- | --- | --- | --- |
| quality_states | p_panel | Pair lots and material states through all handoffs; reproduce absolute dry-matter/water and source-separated carbon balances with uncertainty; expose unexplained differences. | cp_handoff; cp_water; cp_carbon |
| quality_providers | all inventory rows | Identity confirmation does not establish amount, region, technology, time or supplier burden. Keep each unavailable exact UUID, property or background-basis match explicit; no broad emission or correction-flow substitutes. | Provider documents and flow support evidence |
| quality_emissions | p_panel | Actual after-control and fugitive bamboo/PF observations are required. EPA wood guidance is a qualitative checklist only; softwood/CORRIM means, wood dust PTE and boiler factors are not bamboo-panel emission factors. Absence/zero needs test or route evidence. | cp_air; cp_pm; detection limits and route records |
| quality_campaign | p_panel | Disclose representative operating period, idle/rework coverage, starting/ending stocks, load, acceptance and calibration. Site data and historical illustrative sources remain distinct. | Complete measured campaign and source limits |

## 9. Validation Rules

| rule_id | applies_to | rule | source_ids |
| --- | --- | --- | --- |
| validation_identity | p_panel | Require every reference qualifier and PF woven-mat route evidence. Reject inputs already carbonized, steamed/boiled, bleached, preserved or glued, and reject curtain/strip/scrimber or overlaid outputs under this PCR. General bamboo identity alone is insufficient. | fao-china-bamboo-1998; itto-woven-mat-2014; inbar-industrial-bamboo-2015 |
| validation_reference | p_panel | Require exactly one finished reference product output, 1 m3 net accepted solid panel, the same denominator in both languages and all linked collection protocols. Preserve stage measurement records without a second intermediate reference output. | itto-woven-mat-2014 |
| validation_balances | p_panel | Check absolute physical mass, water, PF stocks and separate biogenic/fossil carbon with uncertainty before attribution. Require identical sending/receiving links and separate burden accounting. Unexplained residuals remain incomplete, not assumed releases or allocated mass. | itto-woven-mat-2014 |
| validation_quantities | all inventory rows | Require real protocols, unit/property evidence and supplier quantity correspondence, including wet/dry PF basis and net steam enthalpy definition. Missing UUIDs, net heat definitions, measured quantities or background links prevent a complete linked dataset; disclose them rather than claiming coverage. | itto-woven-mat-2014 |
| validation_emissions | p_panel | Require chemical and medium-specific after-control emission records and three non-overlapping particulate bins. Do not discard biogenic CO2 or substitute correction flows. Record all newly observed species as their own atomic exchange. | epa-plywood-2002 |
| validation_carbon_claims | p_panel | Reject carbon-neutral/negative or avoided-energy claims derived merely from bamboo growth, colour, heat treatment or a future combustion scenario. Declared material carbon storage is separate from emission inventory and chosen impact-method reporting. | inbar-industrial-bamboo-2015 |

## 10. Published Dataset Profile

| Field | Value |
| --- | --- |
| dataset_role | secondary_dataset; background_dataset only after route-compatible measured and linked completion |
| downstream_use | Manufacturing-gate PF woven-mat bamboo panel supply at stated quality/moisture |
| allowed_use | Evidence-matched panel purchase using declared solid-volume and provider bases; candidate guidance requires review |
| excluded_use | CPC-wide bamboo proxy, installed floor service, curtain/strip/scrimber/overlaid panel, chemically or thermally treated input, onsite combustion/treatment without extension, carbon-neutral marketing |
| required_metadata | All reference qualifiers; campaign and plant; absolute/attributed ledgers; supplier/treatment scope; recipe assay; heat definition; collection and calculation lineage |
| required_quality_disclosure | Unresolved identities and provider bases, measured coverage and detection limits, stock balance residuals, uncertainty, allocation and exclusions; no implied scientific approval |
| update_trigger | Changed mat treatment/species/weave, resin/formulation, panel surface/construction, utility boundary, provider, emission control or reference moisture/grade |
