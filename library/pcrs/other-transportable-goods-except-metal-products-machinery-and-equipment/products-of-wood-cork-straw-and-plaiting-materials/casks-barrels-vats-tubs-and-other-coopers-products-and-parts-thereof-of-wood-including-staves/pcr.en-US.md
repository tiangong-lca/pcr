# New oak wine barrel production


## 1. Scope and Applicability

This methodology covers production of new, unused wine barrels with solid oak staves and oak heads retained by permanent steel hoops, accepted at the cooperage gate. It distinguishes rough staves, seasoned blanks, formed shells and leak-tested complete barrels. Toast level is a declared product configuration, not a universal temperature or emission factor. Natural seasoning, mechanical operations, steam/fire bending, sensory toasting, hoop fitting and leak tests retain separate activity records. The factory examples establish feasible routes rather than an industry-average bill of materials. [seguin-process; seguin-toasts; taransaud-quality]

Excluded products are saleable stave/head semifinished products as reference outputs, other-wood or composite barrels, vats/tubs, charred spirits casks, barrels after wine use and reconditioned barrels. Refurbishment requires prior-use history, cleaning, removed contaminated wood, repair and service-capacity evidence; it cannot inherit this new-manufacture reference. Supplier forest origin, oak species, capacity, seasoning time, toast intensity and useful life have no default values. Optional actual consumables, treatments, emissions and packaging must be added as one atomic exchange each before a dataset claims completeness. [usda-wood-2021; thermal-wood-2005]

| classification_refs | CPC3.0 31703; proposed narrower scope only; accepted mapping is independently governed |
| covered_products | New all-oak wine barrels, bare black or galvanized steel hoops, declared bending and toast configuration |
| excluded_products | Staves/heads sold alone; used/refurbished barrels; non-oak or composite barrels; vats/tubs; charred spirits casks |
| representative_product | One specified new oak wine barrel model; no fixed oak origin, capacity or service life |
| production_route | Declared split/sawn oak receipt or verified seasoned blank; natural seasoning; machining; rosing; steam/fire bending; toast; head/hoop assembly; leak test; net-mass acceptance and packing |
| market_state | New, unused, empty, accepted complete barrel at factory gate |


## 3. Reference Flow

| Field | Value |
| --- | --- |
| What | Provide a complete new oak container for the declared wine maturation or fermentation application |
| How much | 1 kg accepted net new oak wine barrel; also report accepted barrel count and each model capacity, without converting capacity to product mass |
| How well | Meet the declared model, stave/head construction, hoop specification, toast profile and documented leak-test criterion; compare only equivalent configurations |
| How long or cycle | One manufacture and factory acceptance cycle. Wine use cycles and useful life require independent user evidence; no default years or fills |
| reference_flow_link | accepted_new_oak_barrel |

| Field | Value |
| --- | --- |
| Reference amount | 1 |
| Reference product flow | Casks, barrels, vats, tubs and other coopers' products and parts thereof, of wood, including staves `8b100f0f-21c2-4373-b469-a67b4f87973e` |
| Reference flow property | Mass `93a60a56-a3c8-11da-a746-0800200b9a66` |
| Reference unit group | Units of mass `93a60a57-a4c8-11da-a746-0800200c9a66` |
| Reference unit | kg |
| Required qualifiers | new/unused state; wine function; oak species and verified origin or explicitly unknown origin; split/sawn route and receipt moisture; seasoning start/end and supplier boundary; measured barrel net mass and moisture; accepted count; nominal/verified capacity; stave/head dimensions; permanent hoop material/coating/mass; supplied closure; bending method; toast label and actual temperature/time program, fuel and oxygen conditions; leak-test method/criterion/result; factory/year; delivery boundary; packaging separately; biogenic carbon basis; dataset allocation and missing evidence |

The broad product UUID includes the physically specified finished barrel; it does not establish an oak-specific background dataset. Declare all qualifiers in dataset metadata or equivalent evidence; missing identity or acceptance qualifiers make the data package incomplete. A capacity-normalized wine-service comparison requires demonstrated capacity, service cycles and equivalent wine-quality function; 1 kg is an inventory normalization, not proof of equal wine service.

## 4. Measurement and Unit Rules

| rule_id | Applies to | Required property | Required unit | Rule |
| --- | --- | --- | --- | --- |
| reference_mass | accepted_new_oak_barrel | Mass | kg | Q is measured accepted net mass of a compatible batch of complete barrels after test drainage, including installed hoops and supplied closure but excluding test water and dispatch packaging. Use cp_acceptance. All inventory rows use per 1 kg reference flow; keep raw batch totals. |
| wood_water_basis | all wood and residue rows | Mass | kg | Record as-received mass and dry-basis moisture u for each stage. m_dry = m_wet/(1+u), where u is kg water/kg oven-dry wood. Measure oak MC; do not use a generic density or softwood MC. Moisture loss is not automatically wood yield loss. [usda-wood-2021] |
| power_basis | all electricity rows | Net calorific value | MJ | For verified <1 kV alternating current, measured kWh × 3.6 = MJ electrical energy. Match supplier voltage and delivered boundary; no fuel calorific or generation-efficiency conversion is inferred from the database property label. |
| gas_volume_basis | all natural gas rows | Volume | m3 | Use cp_heat for measured volume at stated T/P, composition, wet/dry state and compressibility; match the background reference-volume convention. Unknown compatibility remains pending; no assumed density from secondary flow coefficients. |
| steam_basis | bending_purchased_steam | Mass | kg | Collect delivered steam mass, pressure, temperature, dryness and return conditions. A net delivered heat calculation needs supplier enthalpy definition and a site steam/condensate/blowdown balance; a MJ property alone is insufficient. Do not select high-pressure or source-specific paper/chemical steam for unspecified cooperage supply. |
| elementary_basis | all elementary output rows | Mass | kg | Keep chemical/CAS identity, carbon origin, source stage and receiving air subclass. NOx mass versus NO2-equivalent requires explicit compatible definitions; exclude N2O and avoid double-counting NO/NO2. PM2.5, PM2.5-PM10 and >PM10 are disjoint emitted fractions, not three cumulative PM totals. [epa-wood-boilers; epa-sawmill-pte-scope] |


## 5. System Boundary

### Boundary Abstraction

| Field | Value |
| --- | --- |
| declared_starting_condition | Untreated green split/sawn oak blanks delivered to seasoning/cooperage, or separately identified purchased air-seasoned oak blanks with verified upstream seasoning coverage |
| starting_condition_role | Foreground cut-in with upstream cradle burdens explicitly linked; not a burden-free raw material or universal industry start |
| product_classification_scope | New oak wine barrel subset of CPC3.0 31703; covers no stave-only/reference vat or refurbishment datasets |
| recursive_input_rule | A purchased prepared blank or part requires an upstream provider for its actual prior manufacturing/seasoning. Internal retained wood and recirculated water are physical stage records, not new purchases or duplicate cradle burdens |
| upstream_dataset_requirement | Species/route/state-compatible forestry and blank preparation, delivery transport, steel hoop fabrication/coating, delivered utilities, packaging and waste treatment; unresolved providers disclosed and completed before cradle-to-gate claims |
| disclosure | Receipt state, upstream coverage, measured stage map, utilities/purchased versus internal heat, waste destination, test acceptance, allocation, exclusions and omitted evidence. Finished barrel ready for dispatch at factory gate; wine use and end-of-life outside this production dataset |

| rule_id | applies_to | rule | source_ids |
| --- | --- | --- | --- |
| boundary_states | new_barrel_production | Retain separate rough/seasoned/stave-shell/complete-barrel states and all actually executed stages. Model the integrated cooperage unit from receipt through accepted dispatch once; stage transfers are metered internal ledgers, not extra reference outputs. | seguin-process, taransaud-quality |
| boundary_thermal | thermal and boiler stages | Distinguish bending heat from sensory toast, direct fuel burning from degradation of retained oak, and separate boiler outlets. Use EPA boiler evidence only for a matching actual boiler; open fires require their own site emission evidence. | seguin-toasts, thermal-wood-2005, epa-wood-boilers |
| boundary_material | all inventory rows | Include actual raw materials, utility use, rejects, wastewater, wastes and emissions. A UUID gap does not authorize omitting a physically present flow; preserve a concrete atomic exchange and provider/identity gap. Document any actual treatment additive, adhesive, oil, packaging component or direct natural-water release with its own row before completeness. | usda-wood-2021, taransaud-quality |
| boundary_carbon | wood and air outputs | Keep dry wood, retained toasted-layer carbon, exported residues, collected char/ash carbon and emitted chemical carbon as a reconciled physical account; retain biogenic CO2 in LCI. Upstream forest uptake is counted once in the linked boundary and not inferred as a negative cooperage emission. | usda-wood-2021, thermal-wood-2005, epa-wood-boilers |


## 6. Process Inventory Structure

### Process Map

| process_id | process_name | inclusion | inclusion_condition | role | quantitative_reference |
| --- | --- | --- | --- | --- | --- |
| new_barrel_production | New oak wine barrel production | required | All actual stages of the declared receipt/configuration | foreground production | per 1 kg reference flow |

One integrated foreground unit is used because the same barrel passes through machining, shaping, testing and packing; there is one saleable reference output. Preserve this ordered physical stage map and the measured mass, water and carbon transfers independently of the environmental burden account. At a separately modelled stage boundary, both sides must link the same real intermediate, quantity, moisture and time; no fictitious second finished-barrel UUID or allocation-scaled transfer is permitted.

| stage_id | inclusion | operation | physical records |
| --- | --- | --- | --- |
| receipt | required | Wood receipt and stock reconciliation | Species, split/sawn/seasoned state, lot mass and supplier coverage |
| seasoning | conditional | Natural air seasoning | Required for green receipts; actual dates, air/rain, sprinkling, loss and water/energy logs; pre-seasoned purchases link upstream |
| machining | required | Trim, plane, hollow, joint staves; machine heads and grooves | Keep wood yield, sawdust, shavings, offcuts, dust control and electricity by operation |
| bending | required | Rosing, preheat and steam/fire bending | Declare actual method; distinguish wetting, steam, fuel, internal/off-site heat and temperature/time history |
| toasting | conditional | Oenological toasting | Declare no-toast or actual toast label, temperature/time/oxygen and fuel; retained toasted layer differs from removed char |
| assembly | required | Head setting, permanent metal hoops and final sanding | Stave/head/hoop/bung net masses, temporary-tool reuse, actual purchased versus locally formed hoops |
| leak_test | required | Water-tightness test and corrective rework | Actual fill/pressure/duration/criterion, water reuse, reject and final acceptance; no default test volume |
| dispatch | required | Drain, measure net mass, prepare and pack for dispatch | Accepted count and mass Q, residual water, packaging separately and dispatch boundary |
| boiler | conditional | On-site steam generation | Only if actual boiler operates: feedwater, fuel, internal steam, condensate, blowdown, ash and separate stack monitoring |

##### Elementary flows

All elementary emission cards below refer to outdoor air, unspecified subcompartment. Use a matching verified subclass if the site establishes urban ground-level, high-stack or another receiving condition; these records cannot be substituted for indoor workplace exposure. Source stage and outlet remain distinct collection fields; a shared thermal hood must not be counted once for every stage it serves.

## 7. Allocation and Co-product Handling

| rule_id | applies_to | rule | source_ids |
| --- | --- | --- | --- |
| allocation_direct | new_barrel_production | First use measured subdivision or causal direct attribution. Finishing, leak tests, permanent hoops and barrel-only packaging belong to the barrel. Saleable wood coproducts are identified by actual destination/contract; waste disposition alone does not establish a coproduct. | corrim-allocation-case, taransaud-quality |
| allocation_physical_ledger | all inventory rows | Maintain the complete unallocated physical stage, dry-mass/water/carbon ledger. Internal offcut fuel is accounted once with matching produced and consumed mass and moisture. Whole-unit internal transfers cancel; do not assign avoided upstream fuel burden or duplicate purchases without a separately declared substitution scenario. | usda-wood-2021, thermal-wood-2005 |
| allocation_shared_burden | shared environmental burdens | If unavoidable shared burdens remain, justify a site-specific physical causal relationship for eligible coproducts; report the eligible masses and shares. If no physical relationship can be defended, justify economic attribution using same-period net revenues and test an alternative. The softwood case supplies no oak cooperage allocation share or default method. | corrim-allocation-case |
| allocation_no_mass_scaling | coproduct outputs and internal links | Apply allocation shares only to the burden account, never multiply actual barrel/coproduct output quantities, residual carbon, internal wood transfers or measured water by a share. Keep the full physical ledger alongside the allocated product dataset; reconcile that ledger rather than demanding mass closure in the reduced burden ledger. | usda-wood-2021, corrim-allocation-case |

### Calculation Rules

| rule_id | Applies to | Formula or rule | Inputs | Output | source_ids |
| --- | --- | --- | --- | --- | --- |
| normalize_batch | all inventory rows | Divide stock-corrected attributable exchange totals by accepted net barrel mass Q from cp_acceptance; express per 1 kg reference flow. For the reference product, Q/Q = 1 kg/kg. Retain the physical and allocated burden accounts separately. | cp_acceptance; cp_resources; cp_wood; cp_heat; cp_parts; cp_residues; cp_air; cp_balance | batch-normalized exchanges | usda-wood-2021 |
| dry_wood | wood and residue rows | u = (m_wet - m_oven)/m_oven; m_dry = m_wet/(1+u). Sample the same material state; do not subtract water again from oven-dry mass. | m_wet; m_oven; cp_wood; cp_residues | dry material mass and moisture | usda-wood-2021 |
| water_reconcile | season_water_vapour, test_drying_vapour, thermal_water_vapour, boiler_water_vapour | Apply independently to each named stage and cohort: evaporation = incoming water (wood, fuel, fresh water, rain, imported steam and internal transfer) + independently evidenced chemical water formed - outgoing retained/exported water (wood, runoff, test water, blowdown, condensate and internal transfer) - stored-water change. Match internal transfers at both ends; cancel them only in the whole-unit ledger. Never assign a whole-unit evaporation total to multiple stage rows. Unknown infiltration, chemical formation or stage partition remains unresolved. | cp_balance; cp_wood; cp_resources; cp_heat; cp_residues | water balance and evidenced vapour mass | usda-wood-2021 |
| carbon_reconcile | wood, fuel and air rows | For each carbon origin, input carbon = retained barrel carbon + exported coproduct/waste carbon + removed char/ash carbon + emitted species carbon + stock change + disclosed residual. Use measured dry mass times measured compatible C fraction. Derive species carbon by molar stoichiometry; combustion and pyrolysis share the same carbon supply and cannot each receive all of it. | cp_balance; cp_wood; cp_heat; cp_residues; cp_air | separate biogenic/fossil carbon ledger | thermal-wood-2005, epa-wood-boilers |
| particulate_partition | all PM rows | From the same outlet, period, method and PM phase basis, the 2.5-10 fraction equals cumulative PM10 minus cumulative PM2.5; >10 equals comparable total PM minus PM10. Use only evidenced nonnegative differences with propagated uncertainty. Otherwise keep the size distribution unresolved. Do not add cumulative totals alongside these disjoint fractions. | cp_air; outlet and phase compatibility | disjoint emitted PM fractions | epa-sawmill-pte-scope, epa-wood-boilers |

### Data Quality Requirements

| requirement_id | Applies to | Requirement | Evidence |
| --- | --- | --- | --- |
| quality_basis | all inventory rows | Use compatible receipt/model/toast cohorts and complete seasoning stock changes, never divide old stock inputs by only current dispatch Q | cp_acceptance, cp_wood |
| quality_uncertainty | all inventory rows | Unknown origin, capacity, life, quantities, provider basis, chemical definition or emission distribution remain explicit. No empirical default ranges until independent boundary-compatible evidence exists. Report instruments, variation and model uncertainty | cp_heat, cp_air, cp_balance |
| quality_evidence | new_barrel_production | Manufacturer route sources and laboratory pyrolysis cases support method design only. Do not transfer softwood survey yields/MC, regulatory PTE, generated pyrolysate percentages or aroma measurements to actual emitted kg | usda-wood-2021, thermal-wood-2005, epa-sawmill-pte-scope, corrim-allocation-case |


## 9. Validation Rules

| rule_id | applies_to | rule | source_ids |
| --- | --- | --- | --- |
| validate_scope | reference flow | Require new unused all-oak wine-barrel identity, finished completeness and leak acceptance; reject stave-only, refurbished or unqualified different toast/service configurations. UUID inclusion does not resolve background applicability. | taransaud-quality, seguin-toasts |
| validate_denominator | all inventory rows | Exactly one accepted_new_oak_barrel reference output is 1 kg and every exchange uses the same stock-corrected Q denominator. Keep stages distinct, prevent duplicate product outputs and audit all internal links for equal physical quantity. | usda-wood-2021 |
| validate_flows | all inventory rows | Verify exact physical/chemical identity against name, CAS, route, current classification, reference property and unit; a conflicting species/CAS or hard treatment/route blocks adoption even if a name looks right. An isolated source-classification error may permit conditional use of a coherent physical identity only with an explicit metadata debt, actual material/state/provider verification and source-owner clarification; it is not complete metadata validation. Each row is atomic, with exact Chinese baseName when provided; blank UUIDs retain their concrete exchange and missing-identity disclosure. | usda-wood-2021 |
| validate_energy | all utility rows | Require measured delivered energy/volume/mass on a supplier-compatible basis. Distinguish purchased steam from internal boiler heat, apply kWh/MJ conversion only to electric energy, and leave gas/steam basis compatibility pending when unknown. | epa-wood-boilers |
| validate_emissions | all elementary outputs | Require outlet/medium, actual escaped species, carbon origin and quantity-definition evidence. Verify NOx convention excluding N2O, disjoint PM and filterable/condensable scope. Do not substitute correction flows or equate visible smoke with a PM mass; preserve biogenic CO2 despite GHG-reporting conventions. | thermal-wood-2005, epa-wood-boilers, epa-sawmill-pte-scope |
| validate_closure | physical ledger and allocation | Reconcile dry material, water, biogenic/fossil carbon and all measured destinations with stock changes and uncertainty; retain unexplained residuals. Review allocation against the full unallocated physical ledger and the separately allocated burden ledger; do not change coproduct mass to close allocated burdens. | usda-wood-2021, corrim-allocation-case |
| validate_completeness | dataset profile | Before a complete cradle-to-gate dataset claim, resolve physically present UUID/provider gaps and all route quantities, add actual unlisted atomic flows and treatment releases, disclose skipped checks and uncertainty, and verify all required qualifiers. PCR authored status does not prove site-data or independent methodology approval. | taransaud-quality, usda-wood-2021 |


## 10. Published Dataset Profile

| excluded_use | Stave-only, old/refurbished, spirits-charred, other-wood or unqualified wine-service comparisons; carbon-neutral claims or unsupported generic oak industry factors |
| required_metadata | Reference qualifiers; factory/year and cohort; upstream/provider boundary; atomic exchanges and property/unit; raw protocol records; physical mass/water/carbon ledger; emission definitions; allocation basis |
| required_quality_disclosure | Identity/provider/quantity gaps, missing ranges, sampling/MC/carbon uncertainty, omitted stages/flows, gas/steam basis compatibility, PM/NOx conventions and method/site review status |
| update_trigger | Species/source, receipt moisture/state, seasoning, geometry, hoop/coating, bending/toast/fuel/control, test method, supply/provider or allocation change |
