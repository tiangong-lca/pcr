# Mixed recovered paper and paperboard supply to a repulping receiver

## 1. Scope and Applicability

This PCR covers one actual mixed used-paper/board supply lot that remains mixed across paper grades after collection, removal of prohibited or non-paper matter, dry handling and actual compaction/baling. The endpoint is its first unconditional net-material quality release by an identified repulping receiver, before entry to the pulper. Collection may be municipal or private, but the recovered paper is a specified material supply; collection of mixed residual refuse or provision of a waste-treatment service alone does not satisfy this product function. JRC reports actual mixed-paper plant outputs distinct from corrugated and graphic-paper outputs; Smurfit provides an independent mixed-packaging supply example. These sources are a transparent process synthesis, not one contemporary factory, SKU, order or recipe.

New paper; pulp including deinked pulp; finished recycled paper; textile fibres; medical or hazardous waste; material extracted from mixed residual refuse; separately traded single grades of unbleached kraft/corrugated paper (39241), bleached chemical-pulp paper not coloured in the mass (39242), or predominantly mechanical-pulp paper (39243). Constituent occurrence in a genuinely premixed lot does not make three separate purchases. A pure grade routed out of sorting is a separately accounted output under its applicable methodology, never this reference product.

The representative route uses mechanical dry contaminant removal and a wire-bound bale; it does not prescribe grade ratios, bale density, moisture, yield or utility quantities. Heating, washing of paper, chemical decontamination, shredding to a new product or pulping require additional route evidence and methodology. Cleanup water is conditional and is not paper washing. Every actual additional purchased formulation, fuel, packaging component, waste and emitted species must be added as its own atomic exchange; absent records are not zero.

| covered_products | Real unrepulped mixed used-paper/board supply lots; paper grades remain mixed after foreign-matter removal |
| excluded_products | New paper; pulp including deinked pulp; finished recycled paper; textile fibres; medical or hazardous waste; material extracted from mixed residual refuse; separately traded single grades of unbleached kraft/corrugated paper (39241), bleached chemical-pulp paper not coloured in the mass (39242), or predominantly mechanical-pulp paper (39243). Constituent occurrence in a genuinely premixed lot does not make three separate purchases. A pure grade routed out of sorting is a separately accounted output under its applicable methodology, never this reference product. |
| representative_product | One weighed mixed-paper bale lot accepted as feedstock by its named repulping receiver |
| production_route | Original-holder handover → collection/transport → reception and negative sorting → dry compaction/baling → actual receiver transport and unconditional release before repulping |

## 3. Reference Flow

| Field | Value |
| --- | --- |
| What | Provide mixed recovered paper feedstock accepted for the receiver's specified repulping use |
| How much | 1 kg net mixed paper material at actual measured release moisture; exclude bale wire and transport packaging |
| How well | Meet the identified receiver contract and measured composition/contaminant/moisture specification; no universal grade or numerical target |
| How long or cycle | One identified supply/release cohort; repeat inspection and delivery do not create new production |
| reference_flow_link | mixed_paper_release |

| Field | Value |

| Reference amount | 1 |
| Reference product flow | Waste paper `d1008171-2d06-4e14-b107-7e510875203f` |
| Reference flow property | Mass `93a60a56-a3c8-11da-a746-0800200b9a66` |
| Reference unit group | Units of mass `93a60a57-a4c8-11da-a746-0800200c9a66` |
| Reference unit | kg |
| Required qualifiers | lot and original holder; source paper history and inherited burden vector; actual paper-grade composition and moisture basis; mixed status and excluded-grade test; collection and transport legs; contaminant identities and dispositions; receiver and acceptance specification; first unconditional quality-release timestamp and Q; gross physical mass V and packaging tare; opening and closing WIP by exchange vector; opening and closing FG by original cohort; failed and zero-output periods; rework and returns linked to original release; actual utility supply and provider boundary; wire composition and packaging ledger; attributional allocation/value gate and residual shares; native UUID property/unit compatibility; uncertainty and unresolved rows |

Declare every qualifier in dataset metadata or equivalent process/reference-flow notes. The Product identity is a generic ELCD-reconstructed waste-paper material, not a certificate of this supplier or grade. Its Mass reference is used; secondary net/gross calorific factors of 14 and 16.4750000852581 are retained identity context only, not density, recipe, moisture, energy input or measured heating value.

## 4. Measurement and Unit Rules

| rule_id | Applies to | Required property | Required unit | Rule |
| --- | --- | --- | --- | --- |
| reference_mass | reference product | Mass `93a60a56-a3c8-11da-a746-0800200b9a66` | kg | Use one net mixed-paper mass basis. Q is the sum of unique first unconditional receiver releases, excluding wire/packaging and duplicate reinspection; weigh actual moisture and report oven-dry paper solids separately. Commercial moisture deductions are not silently substituted for physical mass. |
| numerator_units | all inventory rows | row-specific | row-specific | Collect raw totals before division. Convert kWh to MJ with 3.6; tonne-km to kg*km with 1000. Oil uses Volume/m3; convert L to m3 with 0.001 and weigh or measure that oil's density at stated temperature only for its physical mass ledger. Integrated volumes are not multiplied by time again; integrate only genuine rates. |
| no_invented_conversion | all inventory rows | measured physical basis | declared | No assumed kg per bale or default water/oil density. Item counts require measured net mass for the same configuration. Supplied mixtures cross once as whole consignments with non-additive composition subledgers; actual on-site formulation requires each purchased ingredient and its losses. |

## 5. System Boundary

### Boundary Abstraction

| Field | Value |
| --- | --- |
| declared_starting_condition | Actual source-paper lot at original-holder handover, with its origin-specific prior production/recycling burden identified; not burden-free by name |
| starting_condition_role | Explicit foreground observation boundary; upstream history remains modelled and disclosed |
| product_classification_scope | Mixed paper remaining mixed, proposed subset of CPC3 39249; no coverage claim for all other paper waste |
| recursive_input_rule | Externally acquired premixed paper is recorded once with one provider/burden vector; retrieve upstream preparation and source histories without counting the same collection/baling leg twice |
| upstream_dataset_requirement | Origin-specific paper production and prior recovery inventories at actual handover state; utilities/materials/transport and waste treatment with explicit provider cut; no invented recovery rate or avoided credit |
| disclosure | Sites and period; paper-source partition; value/status transitions; transport ownership; release/WIP/FG gates; actual emissions and treatment fate; missing source history prevents a complete dataset |

| rule_id | applies_to | rule | source_ids |
| --- | --- | --- | --- |
| boundary_full_route | all foreground processes | Include original-holder handover, all collection and receiver transport, unloading, receiving inspection, actual removal of hazardous/non-paper intrusions, conveyors, dry compaction, wire binding, dust control, receiver unloading and final unconditional release before pulping. Reject suspected hazardous lots to the actual controlled handler; this PCR does not supply hazardous-waste treatment methodology. | jrc-paper-bref-2015; cepi-quality-control; smurfit-mixed-packaging |
| boundary_operations | recovery and cohort services | Retain all start/stop, failed loads, zero-output, idle, cleanup, rework, maintenance, losses and opening/closing WIP. Retain actual post-release storage/packaging/handling through the declared pre-pulper handover, attributed to original release cohort Qc; H is a service activity and never a production denominator. No fictitious steam or boiler is introduced. | jrc-paper-bref-2015; ilcd-attributional-2010 |
| boundary_provider | all exchanges | For each outsourced freight or treatment leg choose its explicit provider boundary once; do not add its fuel/emissions again as own operations. Own fuelled handling uses separate diesel and species exchanges. Preparation stops before repulping/deinking/papermaking; no displacement credit for those products. | jrc-paper-bref-2015; ilcd-attributional-2010 |

## 6. Process Inventory Structure

### Process Map

| process_id | process_name | inclusion | inclusion_condition | role | quantitative_reference |
| --- | --- | --- | --- | --- | --- |
| recovery | Source handover through receiver release | required | Actual source-separated mixed paper material supply; no pulping | Complete route observation with internal stage/lot ledgers | Unique first-release net mass Q |
| cohort_service | Post-release cohort services to pre-pulper handover | conditional | Actual storage or handling after first release | Service increments assigned to original cohort | Original release cohort Qc; H is service exposure only |

Every card is one actual boundary exchange. An incoming real premixed consignment and an outgoing whole mixed lot are single physical supplies, not future-choice collections. A waste outlet with several origins is counted once; its source partitions are non-additive. Chemical ingredients, source-paper fractions and water assay within one purchased lot are not additional purchases. Conditional rows require recorded presence/absence; unlisted actual exchanges must be added, not hidden in an “other” pool.

###### Iron or steel bale binding wire (`wire`)

Measure one actual flexible iron or non-alloy steel baling wire supplied for this bale, including breakage and retained wire stocks. Current native Product/Mass/kg identity is iron or non-alloy steel wire for baling and material binding, CPC41263, production mix at plant; former fencing classification is historical, not a current physical barbed-wire requirement. Use only this physical binding article; actual grade, coating, composition, diameter, strength and provider remain to be declared and verified, with no bale mass or performance guessed.

###### Purchased hydraulic-fluid formulation (`hydraulic_oil`)

Conditional replenishment/change of the baler hydraulic-fluid formulation, bought once as the whole base-oil-plus-additive product; components are composition subledgers. Native Product is Hydraulic Fluid with mineral or synthetic base oil plus additives, Volume/m3, without a fixed grade/location/provider; match the actual formulation and measure its volume. Physical oil mass requires independent density at recorded temperature or direct weighing; never use water density or lubricant energy factors.

###### Purchased tap water for actual cleanup (`cleanup_water`)

Conditional cleanup water, not a default washing or pulping step. Native Product/Mass/kg is treated piped municipal/potable water supplied at plant/to consumer, with local treatment variation; no raw/surface water or steam substitution. The secondary 0.001 Volume conversion is not a site density measurement; weigh supplied water or independently measure its density/state when converting a meter reading, then follow actual wastewater, retained moisture and evaporation fates.

All post-release waste and emission outlets use the corresponding explicitly identified recovery cards as whole-route outlets with non-additive stage/cohort partitions in cp_residues/cp_species. Add a separate row if chemistry, medium or provider differs. These outlet cards retain all actual service quantities; no service burden or physical outlet disappears.

## 7. Allocation and Co-product Handling

The following rules apply to attributional modelling only. Physical stock balances and gross mass are established independently before allocating exchange burdens. A positive price, a waste label and legal end-of-waste are different facts; none alone establishes a zero-burden boundary.

| rule_id | applies_to | rule | source_ids |
| --- | --- | --- | --- |
| allocation_subdivision | each exchange and operation | First assign dedicated source lots, operations and service increments directly, or use evidenced actual/virtual subdivision. Preserve the source-paper production and prior-recycling inventory vector by origin, actual grade/quality and handover state; never discard history simply because paper is recovered. Do not assign all historical product use/conversion burdens indiscriminately: identify the technically comparable true co-producing stage and the actual upstream allocation boundary. | ilcd-attributional-2010 |
| allocation_physical | remaining shared exchange | After subdivision test the determining physical causal relationship for this particular exchange and each co-function; use measured causally relevant material throughput, equipment operation or service exposure only where that exchange is determined by it. Mass is not automatically a determinant of every motor, building, separation or treatment burden; no arbitrary choice between physical and economic shares. | ilcd-attributional-2010 |
| allocation_residual | genuinely inseparable residual | Only the remaining common-process residual without an established determinant uses actual contemporaneous market values of the co-functions at the same physical condition and gate. Record quantities, currency, period, delivered state and net price/gate-fee basis; shares sum to one for that residual. No fixed yield, allocation percentage, scrap credit or avoided virgin-paper credit. | ilcd-attributional-2010 |
| allocation_value_gate | source paper and recovery service | For positive-value source paper identify prior true co-production and quality loss with documented upstream inventories; do not assume indefinite equal-quality loops or a default recycling rate. For negative-value handover distinguish prior waste-management stages from the actual process step producing valuable secondary paper; apply subdivision/causality and only then residual value allocation at that step, including the treatment-service function and actual absolute fee value. Model all prior stages in the responsible first system and retain their bridge inventory; do not transfer all preceding treatment to this secondary good or make it disappear. Zero/unknown value needs explicit methodological resolution; record an upstream evidence hold until resolved. | ilcd-attributional-2010 |
| allocation_outputs | paper lots and separated matter | Mixed-paper output is one whole supply with non-additive source fractions and one provider. A separately sold OCC, graphic grade, metal or polymer outlet has its own physical row, quality/state and actual status; route it under the appropriate method and allocate only shared burdens after the hierarchy above. Mere internal reuse, detached wire, collection service or payment does not create an automatic co-product. | un-cpc-2025; ilcd-attributional-2010 |

## 8. Foreground Data Collection, Calculation, and Quality Rules

Retain original unnormalized records and a stage/lot/exchange ledger. Separate physical amounts, background burden vectors and allocation shares. A record-only reading is not a measured factory result; this PCR supplies protocols and no invented site values.

### Data Collection Protocols

Store raw incoming wet/solid masses and inherited exchange vectors; composition partitions sum to the whole without new purchases; no division. | kg | each handover and lot | complete campaign including failed loads and opening lots | all original holders and preparation sites | per 1 kg reference flow | weighbridge calibration; chain of custody; assays; upstream source/value receipts |

Record purchases P, actual first non-purchase external receipts I (including incoming supplier-attached wire or cover and first borrowed/leased packaging), external returns ER, gross shipments and breakage. Detached incoming old wire is physically received in I, not purchased again. P, I and ER are mutually exclusive for the same receipt; internal reuse is none of them. Retain raw component masses for opening + P + I + ER = closing + S + EO + W, and link actual receipt/ownership and inherited exchange vectors once. Packaging stays outside net paper Q; collect without division. Add a concrete atomic physical component interface when an existing interface does not represent an actual receipt; a physical subledger is not a second procurement or an additional copy of a whole supplied load. | kg | each receipt/packing/shipment and stocktake | whole campaign with opening/closing attached stocks | all yards, transit and receiver stock within declared handover | per 1 kg reference flow | component scales; composition/specification; stock and return tickets |

Separate real NO/NO2, fossil/biogenic carbon, evaporation/combustion water and disjoint particles; add each actual emitted chemical and each required physical oxygen/nitrogen exchange. Store raw species quantities or concentration and integrated gas volume; integrate rates only once. Preserve gross physical mass before allocation; no division by product Q. | kg | each emitting operation and representative tests | whole campaign including failures, start/stop and service stages | actual owned emission points and air media | per 1 kg reference flow | laboratory method; CAS/media confirmation; fuel assay; uncertainty; independent C/H/O closure |

Preserve original FG burden; reverse original delivery only for the actual return and add real rework once, without a second first release. Store raw service exchange totals and H by original cohort, with the stored Qc; H is not production and no normalization occurs here.

### Calculation Rules

| rule_id | Applies to | Formula or rule | Inputs | Output | source_ids |
| --- | --- | --- | --- | --- | --- |
| convert_units | all inventory rows | Convert each raw numerator to its card unit before allocation: electricity_MJ = electricity_kWh * 3.6; oil_m3 = oil_L * 0.001; freight_kgkm = freight_tkm * 1000 or sum(actual_cargo_kg * actual_leg_km). A genuine rate is integrated once; a measured integrated volume is already total. Density is independently measured for the actual substance/state where needed, not derived from a secondary flow factor. | raw_amount; raw_unit; actual_cargo_kg; actual_leg_km; measured_density; measured_state; cp_utilities; cp_transport | converted_raw_exchange | jrc-paper-bref-2015; ilcd-attributional-2010 |
| physical_gates | all physical stages | For each physical stage and constituent: opening + real external receipts = closing + actual outward transfers + real wastes + actual emissions; internal transfers cancel between stages. Manufacturing V is gross real outgoing candidate paper, including accepted and rejected portions; Q is only unique first accepted net paper, not V. At the final receiver FG gate: opening_FG + Q + actual_external_returns = closing_FG + gross_outward_paper + external_return_out + losses + rework_to_WIP. Closing_FG already contains the still-stored portion of Q; it is not another manufacturing output. Combine the stage gates by cancelling the same internal Q/transfer exactly once. Do not add a new correction X unless it removes a proven exact duplicate already on the same side and in the same OTHER entry. | cp_lots; cp_release; cp_stock; cp_residues; cp_species | independent_stage_and_combined_physical_balances | jrc-paper-bref-2015; cepi-quality-control |
| packaging_balance | wire; ldpe_cover; service_wire | For each packaging component separately, opening_empty + opening_attached_WIP + opening_attached_FG + opening_reusable + purchases_P + nonpurchase_external_receipt_I + external_return_received_ER = closing_empty + closing_attached_WIP + closing_attached_FG + closing_reusable + gross_physical_shipments_S + external_return_out_EO + waste_W. Include transit in its actual stock gate. Internal reuse cancels, does not create a new purchase, net-paper Q or co-product. One whole waste outlet may have non-additive packaging/feed partitions; never sum them again.  I is independently measured non-purchase external ingress, including supplier-attached components and first borrowed/leased packaging; exclude receipts already in P or ER. Physical receipt and stock remain even when the upstream provider already owns the burden. Preserve the actual incoming history and ownership once; procurement burden follows verified actual supply scope and eligible use/withdrawal, not P+I as a new purchase quantity. Do not invent a second provider or charge upstream-included components again. | cp_packaging; cp_service; cp_residues | component_physical_reconciliation | jrc-paper-bref-2015; cepi-quality-control |
| attribute_exchange | all inventory rows | For every raw exchange vector, A_i,c = inherited_opening_WIP_i,c + actual_current_dedicated_i,c + causally_assigned_i,c + residual_assigned_i,c - inherited_closing_WIP_i,c. Reconcile each inherited vector with source history and the stage/lot ledger; no mass-only carryover. Keep FG original production burden with its original cohort c; post-release service increments accumulate once to that same cohort separately. Actual failed/start/stop/idle/cleanup/rework burdens are retained; they are not erased by absence of accepted output. Physical gross flows remain separate from allocated A. | converted_raw_exchange; cp_lots; cp_stock; cp_allocation; cp_service | attributable_raw_exchange_vector_A | ilcd-attributional-2010 |
| calculate_inventory | all inventory rows | For the selected release cohort c with Q_c > 0, a_i,c = A_i,c / Q_c, performed once only after convert_units and attribute_exchange. Q_c is the stored unique first-release net paper mass; this is the only product normalization. For service increments use the same original stored Q_c and accumulate raw A_i,c before this single calculation; H is never a denominator. Cards and collection aggregation refer to this result without another division. The reference Product output is 1 kg. At Q_c = 0 retain every actual raw burden and physical balance, report no per-unit result, and require explicit documented carry/assignment to a later actual cohort without inventing output. | attributable_raw_exchange_vector_A; Q_c; cp_release; cp_service | a_i,c per 1 kg reference flow | ilcd-attributional-2010 |
| independent_constituents | paper solids; water; carbon and actual species | Establish paper/filler/contaminant solids and total physical mass separately from water and relevant element balances. Independently measure at least one quantity for each independent unknown; a residual cannot fit both water and solids losses. Dry paper preparation has no assumed chemical water generation, structural-water release or combustion. For actual engines independently track fuel C/H/S, atmospheric O2/N2 throughput and real exhaust species/water; free moisture, evaporated moisture and combustion-formed water are separate origins, not extra copies of one H2O outlet. COD, BOD, TOC, VOC and NOx equivalents are indicators, not masses of invented specific species. | cp_lots; cp_utilities; cp_residues; cp_species; cp_stock | independent_mass_water_element_and_species_checks | jrc-paper-bref-2015; ilcd-attributional-2010 |

### Data Quality Requirements

| requirement_id | Applies to | Requirement | Evidence |
| --- | --- | --- | --- |
| quality_identity | mixed paper and receiver | Document true mixed-paper supply and receiver compatibility; no classification label, generic UUID, producer page or initial conditional acceptance establishes the actual lot's release. Test exclusions and trace one whole purchased lot/provider. | source history; representative samples; buyer specification; final release register |
| quality_temporal | all operations | Collect a representative complete reporting campaign with opening/closing stocks and service cohorts; retain failures and all nonproduction periods. Quantify uncertainty by meter, sample, allocation and provider scope; do not substitute generic producer ratios. | raw logs; calibration; sampling variance; stock genealogy; sensitivity |
| quality_sources | upstream and shared burdens | Missing source-paper inherited burden, unresolved treatment/value gate or unknown core receiver compatibility is a real dataset completeness hold. Unknown future plant quantities, an ordinary provider choice or unresolved auxiliary UUID is not a fabricated zero, methodology approval or automatic reason to discard these collection rules. | explicit gap register; lineage and source scope; unnormalized records |
| quality_native | every UUID and unit | Match principal name, all language names, synonyms/comments, CAS, route, form, geography, medium, type and every property against actual exchange; use the exact reference property/unit group chain and official Chinese basename. Unresolved auxiliary identities remain specific atomic names; they are not family bindings. | complete native identity and property/unit evidence; supplier compatibility; localized display audit |

## 9. Validation Rules

Assess both declared-method consistency and actual evidence completeness. A syntactically valid projection or a finite measurement check is not scientific, translation, supplier or classification approval.

| rule_id | applies_to | rule | source_ids |
| --- | --- | --- | --- |
| validate_scope | reference product | Verify the actual mixed-paper lot remains mixed, unrepulped and compatible with its named receiver before pulping; reject residual-refuse-only/service-only cases and separately traded 39241/42/43 grades. Confirm final unconditional receiver acceptance rather than mere delivery or collection. | un-cpc-2025; jrc-recycling-2020; cepi-quality-control |
| validate_complete_route | all rows and stages | All actual inputs, losses, returns, failures, cleanup and service emissions/wastes are included as atomic identities with real fates. Check provider cuts for overlaps and omissions; upstream source history and original-cohort burdens remain explicit. Missing evidence is unknown, not zero or pass. | jrc-paper-bref-2015; ilcd-attributional-2010 |
| validate_mass | physical and packaging gates | Independently close stage, FG and combined gross physical mass, water, solids and relevant elements; trace every WIP inherited exchange and original FG burden. Closing FG already contains Q; cancel internal Q exactly once when combining gates. Check each packaging equation independently, actual external returns and gross movements, and no arbitrary X residual adjustment. | cepi-quality-control; jrc-paper-bref-2015; ilcd-attributional-2010 |
| validate_normalization | all inventory rows | Verify raw unit conversion, direct/subdivision/causal/residual attribution and vector carryover precede the one A/Q calculation; Q is first release only, services retain original Qc and H never becomes production. Q=0 preserves actual raw loads without a unit result; reinspection/returns/rework create no duplicate release. | ilcd-attributional-2010 |
| validate_native | adopted and unresolved identities | Recheck all native identity restrictions and unit dimensions, real provider compatibility, official Chinese names and required qualifiers. A chemically inconsistent synonym or wrong air/water medium requires review, not an automatic classifier exemption. UUID-free auxiliary rows remain unresolved and cannot masquerade as verified platform identities. | ilcd-attributional-2010 |
| validate_allocation | all multifunctional gates | Verify the attributional hierarchy and actual prior-life/value transition against the selected source evidence; do not use an industrial sorting paper as authority for LCA allocation, infer a fixed recovery rate, or add displacement credits. Report actual checks, skipped scope, uncertainties and holds separately. | ilcd-attributional-2010 |

## 10. Published Dataset Profile

| Field | Value |
| --- | --- |
| dataset_role | secondary_dataset; background_dataset |
| downstream_use | Actual mixed-paper input before receiver repulping, with original cohort and upstream burden model |
| allowed_use | Matching mixed-paper supply, actual composition/state, accepted receiver specification and declared attributional boundary |
| excluded_use | Pulp or new paper; single separated paper grades; residual-refuse treatment; hazardous waste; universal recycling credits or assumed zero-burden feed |
| required_metadata | All §3 qualifiers; exact physical and provider gates; source origins; Q/WIP/FG/cohort genealogy; measured utility/property units; allocation/value evidence; all actual atomic flows and fates |
| required_quality_disclosure | Temporal/site representativeness; uncertainty and unknowns; measured versus calculated data; unresolved auxiliary identities; source-history/value-gate holds; scientific and translation review state |
| update_trigger | Change of source mix, receiver specification, preparation route, value/status gate, upstream provider boundary, utility supply, emission fate or measurement configuration |
