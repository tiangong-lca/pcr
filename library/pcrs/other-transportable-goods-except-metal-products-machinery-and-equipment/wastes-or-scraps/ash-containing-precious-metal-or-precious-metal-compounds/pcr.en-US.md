# Silver-bearing incineration bottom ash from photographic gelatin precipitate

## 1. Scope and Applicability

This attributional method covers only silver-bearing gelatin precipitate from one segregated photographic-emulsion-manufacture wash-water stream, actually batch-incinerated, with afterburning, filtration, caustic wet scrubbing and cooling, to contained bottom ash for precious-metal recovery. The foreground starts with real wash-water generation and inherited burdens and retains direct steam heating, PN-10 alkaline digestion, sulfuric-acid isoelectric precipitation, settling, decant neutralisation/transfer, slurry pumping, thermal treatment, every actual residue and real packaging/delivery to a named recovery receiver gate. It is not a purchased-finished-ash packing service. Scientific approval remains pending.

This is a transparent technical synthesis of Kodak US3982932A Example 1 and the JRC 2017 §7.1.1.1 thermal equipment/abatement context, not a same-SKU, same-factory or contemporary-order observation. The patent actually incinerates precipitate slurry from emulsion-manufacture wash water into silver-bearing ash; the nearby 33% and Example 1 23% observations concern different dry sludges and are not defaults for ash assay, yield or recipe. The JRC combustible-feed startup-fuel observation cannot establish this wet-sludge thermal demand without measurements. The historical EPA original corroborates the metal-refiner receiver function, not present authorisation. Sources: kodak-silver-gelatin-1976; jrc-nfm-2017; epa-photographic-1976.

Exclude selectors pooling gold/platinum/palladium ashes, unburned sludge, direct scrap-film incineration ash, steel-wool silver traps, non-precious ash 39320, non-ash precious-metal scrap 39332, ores/concentrates, mixed smelting slag, smelted silver alloy and refined silver. Neither a CPC leaf nor a generic native name establishes methodology coverage. Only newly first-released bottom ash enters Q_c; filter dust is a separate transfer and cannot be pooled into that denominator. An actual blended product requires independent composition and method review.

## 4. Measurement and Unit Rules

| rule_id | Applies to | Required property | Required unit | Rule |
| --- | --- | --- | --- | --- |
| release_mass | reference product | Mass `93a60a56-a3c8-11da-a746-0800200b9a66` | kg | Weigh net bottom ash at actual first-release moisture with separately measured tare; dry solids and Ag mass are non-additive analytical subaccounts and do not replace Q_c. |
| raw_conversion | all inventory rows | Declared original property | original to declared unit | Convert original units, integrate true rates, allocate actual shared operations and apply per-flow inheritance before the sole A_ic / Q_c calculation in §8; retain burdens with no unit result at Q_c=0. |
| solution_basis | whole supplied preparations | Mass `93a60a56-a3c8-11da-a746-0800200b9a66` | kg | Purchase each whole supplied preparation once; active substance/carrier water are subaccounts; onsite preparation records each real purchase and mixing loss/energy. |
| thermal_state | injected_steam; furnace_gas | Mass and energy | kg; MJ | Retain steam mass plus independent enthalpy; convert natural gas with independently measured density at actual state, never water or methane density. Do not multiply integrated volume by time again. |
| electric_unit | wet_power; fire_power; gate_power | Net calorific value `93a60a56-a3c8-11da-a746-0800200c9a66` | MJ | Use the verified unit group to multiply kWh by 3.6 for MJ once; supply voltage/geography must match native restrictions. |

## 5. System Boundary

### Boundary Abstraction

| Field | Value |
| --- | --- |
| declared_starting_condition | One actual gelatin/silver wash-water stream at emulsion-manufacture generation, with originating operations and per-flow history |
| starting_condition_role | material_input |
| product_classification_scope | Narrower bottom-ash subset of CPC 3.0:39333; exclude 39320 and 39332 |
| recursive_input_rule | A real same-category ash input brings a verified historical vector once; recursive tracing never creates new production. Actual blending or a different feed route requires review. |
| upstream_dataset_requirement | Link compatible actual wash-water source, reagent, water, energy, packaging and treatment providers by supply/state/geography/scope; never assume zero historical burden. |
| disclosure | Declare originating operations, cohort, species/phases, all operating states, Q_c, stock vectors, receiver, allocation and every gap. |

| rule_id | applies_to | rule | source_ids |
| --- | --- | --- | --- |
| b_origin | all stages | Trace the complete original wash-water generation and its inherited inventory to the actual emulsion manufacturing records/provider; then include alkaline enzyme digestion, direct steam injection, sulfuric-acid isoelectric precipitation, settling, supernatant neutralisation and transfer, and slurry pumping. The starting waste designation does not establish zero historical burden. | kodak-silver-gelatin-1976; jrc-ilcd-2010 |
| b_thermal | p_fire | Include the actual single-hearth batch incinerator with separate afterburner, filter and caustic wet scrubber, cooling and contained bottom-ash release. This is a transparent technical synthesis of the Kodak batch precipitate example and JRC thermal equipment/abatement context, not a same-factory observation. Record the actual temperature/time/oxygen regime and auxiliary supplies; no default burn temperature, fuel-only-startup claim, yield or recovery rate. Any different furnace/abatement configuration needs an explicit reviewed inventory before use. | kodak-silver-gelatin-1976; jrc-nfm-2017 |
| b_terminal | p_gate | Follow the identified ash through storage, actual compatible containment, loading and actual delivery to the named precious-metal recovery receiver gate. Retain technical acceptance for this bottom ash, assay/moisture/contaminant conditions, applicable waste code/status, permit scope and transport/transfer records. A Product UUID, historic patent or old guidance does not establish current legal authorisation or end-of-waste status. Exclude receiver smelting, fluxing, cupellation and refining from the ash supply function. | jrc-nfm-2017; epa-photographic-1976 |
| b_stocks | all stages | For every physical stream and inherited elementary/product/waste inventory component, carry opening WIP plus current additions minus closing WIP to the actual completed/rejected/lost destinations. Retain all failed and zero-output batches, startup/shutdown, idle, cleaning and incremental rework. Internal slurry, recirculation, sweep-back and reprocessed same-cohort material cancel in the combined foreground; no fresh upstream burden is invented or lost. | kodak-silver-gelatin-1976; jrc-ilcd-2010 |
| b_release | ash_release | Q_c is only the net as-released mass newly first quality-released in cohort c; closing finished stock of that cohort is already included in Q_c and is never added again. Dispatch, receiver reinspection, returns and repeat release do not create new production. Subsequent services use that original Q_c. H is a service driver only; gross handled or shipped V is a physical ledger quantity, not the production denominator. A later historical delivery reports the original production vector plus its actual incremental services. | jrc-ilcd-2010; epa-photographic-1976 |
| b_atomic | all inventory rows | Every card is one real exchange. Whole wash water, supplied reagent preparation, wastewater or ash crosses once with non-additive constituent accounts. Add each actual additional purchased chemical, filter/lining replacement, fuel, refrigerant, cooling-water circuit, packaging component, segregated residue, emission species and outlet individually before data completion. Unlisted real exchanges cannot be hidden in zero, other, a family selector or an assumed universal abatement efficiency. Absent, not measured and below detection remain distinct. | kodak-silver-gelatin-1976; jrc-nfm-2017; jrc-ilcd-2010 |
| b_physical | all stages | Reconcile wet/dry total physical mass and separate elemental Ag/C/H/O/N/S/Na/Cl/Br balances at wet, furnace/abatement, finished-stock and combined gates. Use independently measured moisture and composition/speciation; do not fit two unknowns with one residual. Separate free liquid water, vapour, independently established reaction water and any actual hydrate/structural water. Do not infer ash oxygen uptake or silver speciation from total ash mass alone. COD, TOC, VOC and TEQ are indicators, not masses of a selected molecule. | kodak-silver-gelatin-1976; jrc-nfm-2017; jrc-ilcd-2010 |
| b_provider | all stages | At every external transfer link one provider for the whole physical stream and its agreed water/energy/burden scope. Separate material subaccounts do not add second providers. Treat internal returned slurry/ash and packaging as transfers, not new procurement. External condensate/heat-exchange-water returns are Product returns only when real, with measured thermal state and supplier convention; no nonexistent boiler, steam loop, recovery credit or negative waste burden is assumed. | jrc-nfm-2017; jrc-ilcd-2010 |

## 6. Process Inventory Structure

### Process Map

| process_id | process_name | inclusion | inclusion_condition | role | quantitative_reference |
| --- | --- | --- | --- | --- | --- |
| p_wet | Original wash-water formation and wet precipitation | required | selected single-source PN-10/sulfuric batch route | intermediate slurry and decant handling | measured internal wet slurry; not Q |
| p_fire | Incineration abatement cooling and first release | required | actual single-hearth batch furnace with afterburner/filter/caustic scrubber | reference bottom-ash production | ash_release; Q_c |
| p_gate | Original-cohort storage packing delivery and returns | required | actual later services and receiver gate | incremental service; no new production | original Q_c; physical V; H only a driver |

Every card consumes the same exchange-basis result defined in §8; cards and aggregation never divide again. Conditional absence requires evidence; unknown is not zero. All native restrictions and single-species/whole-supply explanations below are part of the complete consumable descriptions.

###### Sodium hydroxide aqueous solution 46% by mass (`naoh46`)

Whole purchased 46% solution for alkaline digestion, measured as delivered. Dissolved NaOH and carrier water are analytical subaccounts, never additional purchases. Do not substitute 30%, 50%, 0.2 N or solid-caustic identities. Actual onsite preparation instead requires each separately purchased input and its measured mixing losses/energy.

###### Bioprase PN-10 proteolytic enzyme preparation (`protease`)

One whole purchased PN-10 preparation, including its supplier-declared formulation. Record actual activity, supplied form and water added onsite to prepare the dosing solution; active enzyme is not purchased again. Rennet, amylase/liquefaction enzymes, peptone and lipase are incompatible substitutions. Patent enzyme doses are case observations, not PCR defaults.

###### Sulfuric acid solution 98% (`acid98`)

Whole 98% solution at plant for isoelectric precipitation. Native record means as-reported solution kg, not pure H2SO4; its industrial-reagent context and source-reported concentration apply. Its cited non-photographic cases establish neither this plant recipe nor an allocation rule. Retain actual certificate and provider; no concentration conversion or duplicate carrier-water purchase.

###### Sodium hydroxide aqueous solution 35% by mass (`naoh35`)

Whole purchased 35% solution assigned to decant neutralisation before actual sewer/treatment transfer; dilution water is a separate tap-water withdrawal. The patent preferred-embodiment dilution is not an assumed factory recipe. If supply differs, replace this exact card after review rather than record an arbitrary pure-active equivalent.

###### Tap water for dilution and cleaning (`wet_water`)

One metered treated municipal tap-water supply at plant, used only for separately measured onsite dilution, dosing-solution preparation and cleaning. Native Mass is reference; its extra Volume property has a nominal conversion and is not an independently measured density. Use actual water mass or independently measured state-specific conversion; never add water already in feed, purchased solutions or injected steam.

###### Water steam for direct injection (`injected_steam`)

Actual externally supplied water steam injected into the reaction liquid. Record steam kg and independently documented pressure, temperature, dryness and specific enthalpy; all condensate entering the liquid is already water in the slurry. Link one provider covering the agreed water-and-energy supply; do not add a fictitious boiler or purchase its heat and mass twice. Paper-mill-specific steam and an unverified 11 MPaG grade cannot bind this exchange.

###### Wet-line electricity (`wet_power`)

Native consumption mix delivered to a user in CN at <1 kV, grid-average alternating current; its reference property is Net calorific value on an energy basis. Adopt this binding only when geography, voltage and actual supply arrangement match; otherwise obtain a compatible flow/provider before use. Convert metered kWh to MJ with the verified unit-group factor 3.6 once. Separate this process meter from other stages and retain all idle, failed and cleanup loads.

##### Waste flows

###### Emulsion-manufacture wash water (`wash_water`)

One segregated wash-water supply from gelatin/silver photographic emulsion manufacture at its generation gate. Retain the actual producing operations, prior inventory vector, silver metal/halide speciation, gelatin, salts, free water and contaminants; no added scrap-film emulsion, mixed fixer, steel-wool trap or municipal sludge enters this route. The entire wet stream crosses once; constituent assays are non-additive subaccounts. The native UUID of this specific upstream input remains unresolved; resolve its compatible whole-flow identity and actual source/provider/inherited inventory before claiming a complete concrete dataset.

#### Outputs

##### Product flows

###### Water condensate returned to steam supplier (`condensate_return`)

Conditional only for real external condensate return from the metered supply header/traps; direct-injected steam condensed into slurry has no separate return. Record mass, temperature, pressure, enthalpy and the actual supplier water/energy accounting convention. Do not infer a return from steam use, and do not call an evaporation-condensate flow its identity.

###### Silver-bearing gelatin precipitate slurry (`slurry_out`)

Actual unincinerated wet bottom slurry after digestion, acidification and settling, transferred internally to p_fire. Weigh wet mass; assay dry solids, silver species, C/H/O/N/S/halogens and water phases independently. Transfer the complete inherited vector row by row. This is not finished ash and does not enter Q.

###### Neutralised photographic decant wastewater (`decant`)

One measured neutralised decant liquid sent to the named sewer/treatment provider under actual acceptance conditions. Record its whole wet amount and non-additive pollutant assays, including silver, dissolved organic carbon, salts, COD and pH. A sewer transfer is not an elementary discharge to natural water, and pH 7 or the patent residual-silver result is not legal permission.

###### Silver-bearing aqueous wet-line cleaning effluent (`wet_cleanup`)

One separately collected cleaning stream, including spills and failed-batch washout where routed here. Keep its actual composition and receiving treatment distinct from decant; internal return to the reactor cancels rather than becoming a second external feed. Add another specific stream card if incompatible cleaning chemicals actually create a separate outlet.

###### Furnace and abatement electricity (`fire_power`)

Native consumption mix delivered to a user in CN at <1 kV, grid-average alternating current; its reference property is Net calorific value on an energy basis.

###### Industrial-furnace natural gas (`furnace_gas`)

One actual natural-gas supply burned in the selected single-hearth incinerator and its separate afterburner, with burner submeters or auditable splitting. Native identity is natural gas burned in an industrial furnace, on Mass/kg; its preserved former other-goods classification is a taxonomy issue, not another fuel. Retain composition, metering state, measured density and heating value independently; do not replace it with methane, boiler gas or paper-mill gas. Collect startup, sustained firing, shutdown, failed-feed, idle and afterburner consumption; high feed calorific value never proves wet sludge needs no fuel.

Natural-gas auxiliary firing of both chambers is an equipment-level synthesis: Alfa Therm documents batch operation on a stationary fixed hearth with a secondary chamber and a natural-gas option; EPA's handbook describes primary and secondary burners, natural-gas firing and their fuel trains. These sources support the compatible burner choice within the retained NFM sequence, not this photographic feed at an observed factory. Actual equipment configuration, supply/provider and operating-state measurements remain required; source specifications and performance values are not defaults.

###### Scrubber makeup tap water (`scrub_water`)

One metered treated municipal tap-water supply at plant, used only for separately measured onsite dilution, dosing-solution preparation and cleaning. Native Mass is reference; its extra Volume property has a nominal conversion and is not an independently measured density. Use actual water mass or independently measured state-specific conversion; never add water already in feed, purchased solutions or injected steam. This withdrawal supplies the actual caustic wet scrubber; internal recirculation is not fresh withdrawal.

###### First-released silver-bearing bottom ash (`ash_release`)

One cooled, contained bottom-ash lot from this single sludge route, first released to the named precious-metal recovery receiver specification. Native Product flow is manufactured ash containing precious metal/compounds at plant, with Mass reference and no silver grade, CAS or particular ash-form limits supplied; these narrower feed, bottom-ash and receiver restrictions remain mandatory. Exclude separate filter dust, scrubber salts, wet unburned sludge, non-precious ash, metal scrap, smelted alloy and refined silver. The release gate is the cooled enclosed producer ash hopper; actual later transport drumming is gate service. Record release moisture, actual Ag metal/halide/other species and contaminants; no assumed purity, yield or end-of-waste status. Whole ash kg includes its water and assayed metals; do not add analytical Ag as a second product.

###### Gaseous formaldehyde to air (`formaldehyde_air`)

Only species-specific formaldehyde measurement; total VOC or TOC cannot stand in for this molecule. CAS 50-00-0. The intended exchange is an elementary emission to air on Mass/kg, not indoor, water, resource uptake or long-term emission. A native UUID is adopted only where shown on this card; otherwise this specific species remains unresolved. The displayed native bindings use the unspecified-air compartment. Resolve a more specific actual receiving subcompartment before application when known. Measure stack and fugitive contributions separately and sum their actual species masses once; unknown, unmeasured and nondetect are distinct from zero. Use the canonical CAS molecule and stated source/medium only: aliases naming isotope-labelled material, another molecule, a supplied mixture, ionic form or physical phase do not widen this identity. No source supplies a default factor.

###### Gross physical ash dispatched to receiver (`ash_dispatch`)

One actual contained bottom-ash shipment from the identified original release cohort, reaching the declared receiver acceptance gate. Same narrowed ash_release identity and native Product Mass/kg; full original bottom-ash/source/assay restrictions apply. V excludes packaging and is not Q or new production; inherited burden plus incremental services travel once. Opening/closing finished goods, returns and rejection histories retain their cohort vectors.

## 7. Allocation and Co-product Handling

| rule_id | applies_to | rule | source_ids |
| --- | --- | --- | --- |
| a_function | all stages | Use attributional accounting. Identify whether the foreground also delivers a separately contracted waste-treatment service, recovered filter dust or useful exported heat; none is assumed from the ash sale or from a disposal invoice. Ash formation is not refined-silver production. No avoided landfill, virgin silver, fuel or electricity credit is automatic. | jrc-ilcd-2010; jrc-nfm-2017 |
| a_subdivide | each exchange | First directly assign exclusive operations and inputs/outputs to the receiving function. Use actual subdivision, then justified virtual subdivision and causal technical models for indivisible equipment. Preserve all operating states and inherited vectors; a metal assay alone is not an allocation share of steam, air treatment or waste-treatment service. | jrc-ilcd-2010 |
| a_causal | each remaining exchange | For each genuinely remaining shared exchange identify the determining physical causality: how changes in each function change that particular flow. Test moisture/evaporation and enthalpy for thermal demand, actual reagent consumption for aqueous chemistry, and measured species/feed element/operating regime for emissions. The criterion may differ by exchange. Never arbitrarily choose physical versus economic allocation or apply one Ag mass fraction to everything. | jrc-ilcd-2010 |
| a_residual | remaining common process | Only if documented exclusive/virtual subdivision and exchange-specific physical causality cannot resolve a remaining common burden may a justified economic allocation be used. Measure contemporaneous actual values of the actual functions at the same common-process gate and physical state, excluding subsequent transport/refining and package value. Treatment fees, positive/negative feed prices and recovered outputs require explicit function/sign analysis; no absolute-value trick, fixed split, spot refined-silver price or future recovery yield. If that basis remains indeterminate, keep the allocation unresolved. | jrc-ilcd-2010 |
| a_conserve | all allocated vectors | Retain physical gross amounts independently of burden assignment. For each inventory component the assigned function vectors plus genuine retained WIP/stock and loss vectors reconcile to the original total. No burden disappears through internal cancellation or zero-output states. State the upstream waste allocation and cut-off choices with evidence; never default the generated wash water to burden-free. | jrc-ilcd-2010 |

## 8. Foreground Data Collection, Calculation, and Quality Rules

### Data Collection Protocols

The aggregation_rule column declares only the eventual reporting basis and performs no arithmetic; collection and method fields retain undivided original records only. After raw-unit conversion, true-rate integration, real allocation and per-flow inheritance, exchange_basis alone performs A_ic / Q_c once.

| protocol_id | process_id | flow_role | record_type | raw_fields | collection_method | unit | frequency | temporal_coverage | site_scope | aggregation_rule | quality_evidence |
| --- | --- | --- | --- | --- | --- | --- | --- | --- | --- | --- | --- |
| cp_feed | p_wet | wash-water origin | generation and transfer records | source plant and line; original operating steps; date; wet mass; dry solids; free water; Ag species; element assays; source inventory vector; status; provider | Trace actual emulsion production and wash-water generation; weigh the complete segregated wet supply and independently analyse representative samples. Retain original units and full per-exchange upstream vector; do not normalise. | kg | each source lot | complete cohort including previous held material | actual emulsion source and receiving wet line | per 1 kg reference flow | source records; scale calibration; assays; upstream inventory evidence |
| cp_wet | p_wet | wet processing | weighing dosing and wastewater logs | batch id; feed; solution whole mass and assay; PN-10 preparation and activity; added water; pH time temperature; steam reference; electricity; decant; slurry; cleaning; O_WIP; C_WIP; inherited vector; failed and zero-output states | Weigh each actual whole purchased preparation and wet outlet separately; meter pumps/digestion and reconcile settling/neutralisation. Keep material/element balances, actual process timing and all off-spec/cleaning loads. Aggregate raw quantities by cohort and row only; no division. | kg; MJ | each batch and operating state | full cohort including startup idle shutdown and failures | one wet-processing line with shared-meter scope declared | per 1 kg reference flow | calibration; dosing logs; activity certificate; wastewater provider and sampling records |
| cp_fire | p_fire | incineration and abatement | metered furnace campaign | cohort; slurry wet/dry mass; feed speciation; furnace temperature time oxygen; burner gas and metering state; gas composition and measured density; afterburner; filter; caustic solution whole amount and assay; scrubber water; electricity; bottom ash; filter dust; purge; rejected ash; cleaning; O_WIP; C_WIP; inherited vector | Weigh actual slurry and each separate solid/liquid outlet and meter every utility/reagent. Keep start-stop, sustained firing, failed charges, idle, cleaning and rework, with uncertainty. Reconcile whole physical and independent elemental accounts before allocation; aggregate undivided raw quantities. | kg; MJ | each charge and matched emission interval | full furnace campaign and residual stocks | actual single-hearth furnace afterburner filter and scrubber | per 1 kg reference flow | feed/ash assays; calibrated meters; campaign log; residue transfer evidence |
| cp_release | p_fire | first bottom-ash quality release | calibrated net weighing and acceptance | cohort c; lot id; gross; actual tare; net first-released ash kg; free moisture; dry solids; Ag metal/halide/other species; C/H/O/N/S/Na/Cl/Br; contaminants; receiver specification; first-release time; duplicate and return flags; Q_c | Use calibrated lot scales and matched representative moisture/speciation samples; subtract actual tare and count only unique newly first-released bottom ash. Retain unnormalised net release masses Q_c and uncertainty. Closing FG already released is not added; reinspection and shipment are separate events. | kg | each first release | original release cohort retained through later delivery | cooled contained bottom ash at declared first-release gate | per 1 kg reference flow | scale calibration; sampling chain; release and receiver criteria; uniqueness ledger |
| cp_steam | p_wet | steam and actual external return | supplier meter and thermodynamic state records | steam mass; inlet pressure; inlet temperature; dryness; specific enthalpy; actual trap/header return mass; return pressure temperature enthalpy; supplier water-energy scope; direct-injected fraction | Meter actual supplied steam mass; obtain independently documented thermal state and enthalpy basis. Trace injected condensate into slurry. Record only genuine external returns and their supplier convention; aggregate raw mass and energy without invented boiler or density. | kg; MJ | each supply interval and return | full cohort including supply-system losses | actual supplier boundary and direct-injection header | per 1 kg reference flow | supplier receipts; state sensors; enthalpy method; return measurements |
| cp_air | p_fire | ambient combustion-air components | gas flow and composition measurement | interval; integrated dry air volume or true rate; temperature pressure; humidity; O2; N2; Ar; inlet CO2; trace constituents; uncertainty | Use calibrated inlet flow and independent composition/humidity at stated conditions. Integrate only true rates; do not multiply an accumulated volume by time again. Convert each constituent using independently justified gas-state relations; keep whole-air and component measures non-additive. No division. | kg | each matched furnace/afterburner interval | startup stable operation failure idle and shutdown | actual air inlet and leak-air boundary | per 1 kg reference flow | flow calibration; composition method; state/humidity records |
| cp_species | p_fire | each actual emitted species and size fraction | stack fugitive and laboratory records | species or size cut; CAS; source fraction; concentration; measurement basis; flow rate or integrated volume; interval; dry/wet and reference-state conditions; air subcompartment; molecular/elemental basis; detection limit; uncertainty; bypass and fugitive events | Measure each species and actual size fraction independently. Multiply matched concentration by volume once or integrate concentration times true rate over time; correct original wet/dry and reference states explicitly. Retain raw masses, nondetect intervals, source apportionment and actual extra species. Do not convert NOx/VOC/TEQ/COD wholesale into a molecule. | kg | each representative interval plus abnormal event | all operating states with unmeasured intervals identified | actual stack and fugitive boundaries | per 1 kg reference flow | laboratory methods; calibration; detection limits; state and flow logs; carbon/speciation evidence |
| cp_thermal | p_fire | actual heat losses and exports | energy balance measurements | fuel energy; steam enthalpy; electrical input; feed energy and moisture; output material enthalpy; real useful heat; measured loss; actual export; uncertainty | Close the actual furnace/afterburner/abatement thermal balance with independent feed, state and heat records. Keep losses and actual exports separate, including their declared sensible/latent scope; no default efficiency or automatic energy export. Retain undivided energy amounts. | MJ | each matched campaign interval | all operating states | actual thermal-system boundary | per 1 kg reference flow | meter/state calibration; enthalpy convention; independently measured feed heating value |
| cp_gate | p_gate | original-cohort services and physical stocks | stock packing delivery and return records | original c and Q_c; O_FG; C_FG; gross handled V; gross ash shipments; receiver accepted and rejected amount; returns and original delivery reversal; physical losses; package tare; electricity; water; cleaning effluent; service time H; each inherited vector | Track original lot/cohort through storage and actual receiver acceptance; keep physical movements separate from new production. Carry original burdens and only incremental rework/services; reverse erroneous original delivery entries in their cohort. Retain raw service totals, histories, zero-output work and stock vectors. H never replaces Q_c. | kg; MJ; h | each movement service interval and receiver event | release cohort plus all later related services | producer stock/loading and named receiver gate | per 1 kg reference flow | stock reconciliation; consignment; receiver documents; scale/meter records |
| cp_pack | p_gate | each steel drum and each PE inner bag | independent packaging ledger | type; material; form; composition; actual tare; receipt_id; component_id; receipt_time; origin; custody_history; cohort; owner; receipt_class; measured_raw_quantity_and_unit; prior_external_dispatch_id; inherited_vector; unused_stock_vector; burden_owner; provider_scope; O_empty; O_WIP; O_FG; O_reusable; P; N_ext; ER; C_empty; C_WIP; C_FG; C_reusable; S; EO; W; internal reuse; residual ash; provider; return and treatment records | Weigh each actual package material/form/type without residual contents and retain measured original quantity/unit, receipt time, source, component identity, custody, cohort, real owner and history. For each component receipt_id classify its physical mass exactly once as P, N_ext or ER, mutually exclusively. P is newly purchased packaging actually received, including components purchased in a whole supplied lot without a separate component invoice; no separate invoice does not make them N_ext. N_ext is first actual external nonpurchase receipt, including first borrowing/leasing or genuinely nonpurchased supplier-attached packaging. ER requires a linked real earlier external dispatch of that same component from this system; a first receipt is never ER or fabricated opening stock. Before a concrete dataset is complete, represent each actual N_ext material/form/type/inlet as an additional atomic physical receipt input interface with its measured raw quantity, cp_pack records and compatible identity/provider evidence; identify each actual steel drum or PE inner bag separately, never a collection selector. Keep drum_purchased/liner_purchased P-only and drum_received/liner_received true-ER-only; do not invent a receipt or force another whole-lot purchase. Keep all exclusive opening/closing empty, WIP-attached, FG-attached and reusable stocks, gross dispatch S, outward return EO and waste W; internal reuse cancels. Reconcile v_pack in undivided quantities. Carry real burden owner, inherited history/vector and unused-stock vector independently of physical receipts; unused stock is not automatic consumption. Assign only actual attributable supply/service burdens once within their evidenced scope, retaining existing whole-load/provider ownership; do not charge package manufacture again, duplicate a whole-load/provider, create a credit or new Q_c. Never count each reuse as procurement. | kg | each lot/movement and period end | all stocks and movements of relevant cohorts | actual container custody and reuse system | per 1 kg reference flow | tare measurements; purchase/return/waste receipts; physical stock count |
| cp_freight | p_gate | external road freight | weighed payload and route records | leg id; original cohort; actual road distance; ash payload; package payload; actual shared cargo; empty/return leg; provider scope; receiver identity; transfer and permit documents | Record actual loaded gross payload in tonnes and actual leg distance in km, including declared allocation to real shared cargo and provider treatment of empty running. Compute raw tonne-kilometres without a production division. External provider supplies its full fuel/emission scope once. | t km | each actual leg | all related deliveries and returns | producer to named receiver and declared return route | per 1 kg reference flow | weighbridge; route/haulier records; scope and receiver acceptance evidence |

### Calculation Rules

| rule_id | Applies to | Formula or rule | Inputs | Output | source_ids |
| --- | --- | --- | --- | --- | --- |
| raw_units | all inventory rows | Convert each undivided raw record to its declared unit first; 1 kWh = 3.6 MJ. For species i use matched concentration times integrated volume, or the integral of concentration times actual volume rate; never both. Any density is independently measured for the actual substance and state. | original_records; state_measurements; cp_wet; cp_fire; cp_species | converted_raw_records | jrc-nfm-2017; jrc-ilcd-2010 |
| cohort_assignment | all inventory rows | Construct A_ic from converted raw exchange i assigned to cohort c after exclusive/virtual subdivision and justified exchange-specific allocation; include opening inherited WIP vector and actual additions, retain closing WIP vector and every failed/lost destination. Keep the vector conservation and physical mass accounts distinct. | converted_raw_records; opening_vectors; closing_vectors; allocation_evidence | A_ic | jrc-ilcd-2010 |
| exchange_basis | all inventory rows | For Q_c > 0 report X_ic = A_ic / Q_c once. X_ic is the exchange amount per 1 kg first-released reference flow of the original cohort. Cards and downstream service ledgers consume X_ic without further division; when Q_c = 0 retain A_ic without a unit result. | A_ic; Q_c; cp_release | X_ic | jrc-ilcd-2010 |
| delivery_history | p_gate | For an actual historical shipment retain its original first-release inventory vector and append only its actual incremental gate-service vector, attributed to original Q_c; shipment gross V and service H never generate a new production denominator. Reverse real original-delivery records for returns and retain real incremental rework. | original_cohort_vector; raw_service_records; original_delivery_records; cp_gate | delivery_vector | jrc-ilcd-2010; epa-photographic-1976 |
| physical_accounts | all stages | For each independently identified stream: opening physical stock plus external inputs equals closing physical stock plus external outputs plus measured transformation terms at the chosen gate. Cancel verified internal transfers; elemental accounts separately apply each actual species composition. Reaction water requires independent reaction evidence; do not fit multiple unknowns from one residual. | weighed_streams; independent_composition; reaction_evidence; cp_air | physical_and_element_accounts | kodak-silver-gelatin-1976; jrc-nfm-2017; jrc-ilcd-2010 |
| package_accounts | p_gate | For each separate package material/form/type: O_empty + O_WIP + O_FG + O_reusable + P + N_ext + ER = C_empty + C_WIP + C_FG + C_reusable + S + EO + W. P is actual new procurement received; N_ext is first external nonpurchase physical receipt; ER is actual receipt linked to a prior external dispatch of the same component. Classify each component receipt once, mutually exclusively, using cp_pack and its actual atomic receipt interfaces; a purchased whole-lot component remains P without a separate invoice. Opening/closing empty, WIP-attached, FG-attached and reusable categories are exclusive. Internal reuse cancels; S follows gross physical dispatch and excludes content mass. EO is actual outward return and W is actual waste; retain both independently. Physical receipt and stock quantities do not by themselves assign consumption or manufacturing burden; preserve real owner, history, inherited and unused vectors and one actual supply/service burden within its provider scope, without duplicate whole-load/provider, credit or new Q_c. | raw_package_records; cp_pack | package_conservation | jrc-ilcd-2010 |

### Data Quality Requirements

| requirement_id | Applies to | Requirement | Evidence |
| --- | --- | --- | --- |
| dq_origin | wash_water | A traceable actual emulsion-manufacture source and inherited inventory are mandatory; a generic wastewater flow or prior PCR conclusion cannot replace them. | source records; original provider inventory; allocation decision |
| dq_example | all stages | Patent Example 1 and the nearby general embodiment report different dry sludge silver contents; neither is a finished-ash assay, industry range, present factory recipe or default recovery. JRC dry combustible-feed fuel observations cannot establish this wet sludge fuel demand. | original context; independent actual assays and energy measurements |
| dq_completeness | all operating states | Retain measured, estimated, missing and below-detection flags per row, including every extra real flow/species. No numerical factory inventories, grade, density, fuel demand or abatement factor is supplied by this PCR. | coverage ledger; uncertainty; original raw records |
| dq_receiver | ash_release; ash_dispatch | Verify technical material acceptance and actual authorised receiver scope for the declared bottom ash and packaging. Historic sources support process function only; actual current receiver documents must accompany the dataset. | receiver specification; assay; permit-scope and transfer records |
| dq_providers | all purchased and waste streams | Check each actual provider against complete native restrictions and the declared physical supply. Ordinary supplier/grade/quantity gaps are foreground collection work; a known incompatible CAS, concentration, route, form, property or medium cannot be waived. | provider scope; specifications; full identity and unit-chain review |
| dq_method | all allocations and conversions | Retain exchange-specific attribution and original/converted units with independently supported compositions and states. Basis checks do not solve unmeasured chemistry, reaction water, market allocation or real plant completeness. | allocation and balance dossier; sensitivity analysis |

## 9. Validation Rules

| rule_id | applies_to | rule | source_ids |
| --- | --- | --- | --- |
| v_scope | dataset | Confirm a single photographic emulsion-manufacture wash-water source, the PN-10/sulfuric-acid precipitate route and actual incinerated bottom ash. Reject mixed precious-metal-ash selectors, non-precious ash 39320 and non-ash precious-metal scrap 39332; source-specific examples are not interchangeable. | un-cpc3-2025; kodak-silver-gelatin-1976 |
| v_native | all UUID-bearing rows | Check full native names, synonyms/comments, CAS, fixed grade, form, route, location, medium/type and every property against the actual exchange. Require search membership and state-100 exact-version direct evidence plus exact referenced property, unit-group and real reference unit. Preserve all restrictions in this card context. No classification-only or name-only acceptance. Unresolved specific input identities, including wash_water, remain ordinary gaps requiring compatible native identity and actual source/provider records before a concrete dataset is complete. | kodak-silver-gelatin-1976; jrc-nfm-2017 |
| v_denominator | ash_release | Verify exactly one ash_release reference output of 1 kg. Reconcile lot release Q_c with gross wet weight less actual tare and release moisture sample; Q_c is not dry Ag kg or total shipments. Closing FG already belongs to first release. Preserve old delivery/return vectors and reverse an original false delivery record in its original cohort; never count reinspection as new manufacture. | jrc-ilcd-2010 |
| v_raw | all collection protocols | Collect only undivided original records. Convert original units and integrate actual rates once, allocate real shared operations and apply per-flow WIP inheritance before the sole exchange-basis division A_ic / Q_c. Neither cards, protocol aggregation nor gate services divide an already normalised value again. If Q_c=0 retain raw burdens and unresolved destination; publish no unit result. | jrc-ilcd-2010 |
| v_physical | all gates | Independently close physical mass, Ag and C/H/O/water and other relevant element accounts with uncertainty; specimen analysis is not additional exchanged mass. Whole mixed gas/liquid measurements and their mutually exclusive source/species partitions are non-additive. Never infer silver recovery, reaction water or unknown species from one balance residual. | kodak-silver-gelatin-1976; jrc-nfm-2017; jrc-ilcd-2010 |
| v_pack | each packaging type | For each drum and PE bag material/form/type separately enforce O_empty+O_WIP+O_FG+O_reusable+P+N_ext+ER=C_empty+C_WIP+C_FG+C_reusable+S+EO+W. Verify measured raw receipt quantity/unit, receipt_id/component_id, time, origin, custody, cohort, real owner, history, inherited/unused vectors and provider scope against cp_pack. Each receipt is exactly one of P new procurement, N_ext first nonpurchase external receipt or ER true return linked to a real prior external dispatch of that same component. Reject first borrowing/leasing or genuinely nonpurchased supplier-attached receipts disguised as P, ER or opening stock; retain purchased whole-lot components as P even without separate invoices. Require the additional atomic physical receipt interfaces for every actual N_ext component; existing P-only and ER-only cards keep their meanings. Opening/closing empty, WIP-attached, FG-attached and reusable categories are mutually exclusive; retain gross S, EO and W. S follows gross physical dispatch, not Q; internal reuse cancels and never becomes fresh procurement or automatic coproduct. Match residual ash to its content ledger, excluding it from steel/PE mass. Verify physical quantity conservation separately from real owner/history and unused vectors; actual attributable supply/service burdens occur once with their original whole-load/provider scope, without second manufacture, duplicate burden, credit or new Q_c. | jrc-ilcd-2010; jrc-nfm-2017 |
| v_thermal | steam and furnace | Verify actual steam mass plus enthalpy and supplier water/energy scope, condensate state and genuine return; close furnace/afterburner useful heat and losses without invented generation/export. Integrated volume is not multiplied by time again; only rates are integrated. Obtain independent substance/state density, never water density for gas/reagent/slurry. | kodak-silver-gelatin-1976; jrc-nfm-2017 |
| v_species | emissions and effluents | Keep air/water compartments, molecular mass versus elemental/indicator basis and fossil/biogenic source partitions explicit. Add every real detected species and outlet not listed here before completeness can be claimed; total VOC/NOx/COD/TEQ cannot be substituted for a particular molecule. No assumed scrubber capture, zero fugitive or credit from below detection. | jrc-nfm-2017; jrc-ilcd-2010 |
| v_receiver | ash_dispatch | Require a named receiver, its actual authorised scope for this material and assay/containment acceptance, transport and consignment evidence. Historical EPA wording is evidence of a receiver function, not current law. Missing actual receiver identity/acceptance, current authorised scope, source formation or inherited inventory prevents completion of the concrete dataset. Keep all ordinary input-identity, site-quantity and auxiliary-provider gaps explicit and resolve them without invented facts. | epa-photographic-1976; jrc-nfm-2017 |
| v_disclosure | dataset profile | Disclose unresolved identities/evidence, measured and unmeasured operating states, extrapolation, temporal/geographic representativeness, allocations and cut-offs. An engineering/schema/basis check is not scientific or translation approval, current legal compliance or accepted classification coverage. | jrc-ilcd-2010 |

## 10. Published Dataset Profile
