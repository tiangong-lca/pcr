# Mechanically fitted arc-resistant CSST natural-gas branch rough-in installation services

## 1. Scope and Applicability

This PCR covers first indoor rough-in installation of one actual designed natural-gas branch using black arc-resistant jacketed CSST and its compatible manufacturer mechanical fittings. It ends at isolated capped, pressure-tested and inspected handover before concealment. The route is routing/cutting/end preparation, mechanical assembly, supports/strike protection, applicable bonding interface, testing, correction/retest and signed transfer. Manufacturer-specific numerical design and test instructions are selected for the actual configuration and jurisdiction, not generalized here. [omegaflex-tracpipe-2026]

Exclude live fuel-gas introduction, purging, appliance connection/combustion/commissioning, line-pressure regulator commissioning, external distribution, underground/direct-burial work, yellow-jacket intermix, LPG, medical gases and heating/ventilation equipment installation. The accepted starting host and authorized design are prerequisites; new branch-attributable alterations, protection and bonding work cannot disappear behind those prerequisites. UN CPC 54640 covers gas-conducting installations; the proposed category is narrower and does not claim whole-leaf coverage. [un-cpc3-2025]

## 6. Process Inventory Structure

### Process Map

| process_id | process_name | inclusion | inclusion_condition | role | quantitative_reference |
| --- | --- | --- | --- | --- | --- |
| branch_assembly | Route, mechanically fit, support and protect the branch | required | Always; conditional material/service exchanges follow actual work | Assemble independent jacketed tubing, fittings/caps, supports/protection and applicable bonding; output unaccepted isolated branch to rough_in_test; receive failed branches for correction | Actual unique assembled branches by transfer id |
| rough_in_test | Isolated rough-in pressure test, corrections and handover | required | Always; all failed cycles and retests remain attributable | Receive assembled branch; isolate/cap, pressure-test/inspect, route failures back to branch_assembly; output accepted branch only after signed gate | 1 Item(s) accepted complete branch |

Branch cutting, jacket stripping and fitting-seat formation remain embedded assembly operations; no independent fabricated-member handoff is evidenced. No separate gas production, chemical reaction, energy-conversion or recovery node is assumed. Rejected/damaged tubing is repaired/replaced only under actual compatible procedures; failed test states never count as final output. Internal correction-loop transfer ids retain quantities and burdens without new branch credit.

## 7. Allocation and Co-product Handling

| rule_id | Applies to | Rule | source_ids |
| --- | --- | --- | --- |
| one_service_output | all processes | One intended service output only; offcuts, usable returns and waste are not assumed co-products.

No avoided steel/gas production, recycling or operating savings credit. | omegaflex-tracpipe-2026 |
| shared_attribution | `assembly_provision_cutting`; `assembly_provision_access`; `assembly_provision_delivery`; `assembly_provision_crew_transport`; test_provision; electricity | Use actual asset/service scope and complete consumer/activity logs to attribute burdens by causal time/use, transport activity or directly metered electricity for the declared service period. Reconcile allocated shares to the source total across both nodes and other jobs; apply once, never add a second component burden already included in a provider package. | omegaflex-tracpipe-2026 |
| custody_balance | material and residual rows | Reconcile opening stock plus gross receipts with installed stock, actual outward usable returns, dispatched waste, measured consumption/releases and retained closing stock. Closing stock carries declared burden forward and is not an outward exchange. Never net a return then count it again.

| period_attribution | `assembly_provision_cutting`; `assembly_provision_access`; `assembly_provision_delivery`; `assembly_provision_crew_transport`; test_provision | For each actual asset identify provision/manufacture period, each use/upkeep period and consumer, replacement event and termination/removal duty. Assign production and terminal shares with actual complete service-life/use evidence, separately charge job use and upkeep, and reconcile all periods/consumers to source totals. Record provider-covered phases; do not charge full production again on each job, shift an unowned terminal duty out of the ledger or double count a replacement. The accepted first branch cycle remains the product denominator; no universal lifetime or annualization. | omegaflex-tracpipe-2026 |

| measurement_uncertainty | all rows | Report calibration/resolution, sampling, supplier mass variability, stock/balance residual, allocated shares and state conversion uncertainty. Missing evidence is a gap, not a numerical zero or arbitrary range. | Meter/scale certificates, bills, physical balances and documented uncertainty |
| version_jurisdiction | rough_in gate | Use actual current applicable system/fitting instructions and qualified approved jurisdiction design; July2026 guide examples do not establish universal pressure, duration, spacing or capacity. | Dated guide/revision, approved plans, qualification, actual protocol/inspection and bonding record |

Range evidence need: Require actual bill of materials, fitting family, mass per part and returned quantities; no universal fitting count, mass or torque is an inventory default. Independently establish every actual identity, state, real provider/receiver and exactly one exchange property/unit before constructing its flow card. Each actual exchange requires its own recorded quantity and applicable method, uncertainty and custody/fate coverage. Auxiliary CP units do not authorize extra exchange views. Actual occurrence unknown is not zero; never invent a material/species/provider list or split a parent total. Quantitative screening evidence must fit each actual exchange; a former family interval cannot be copied or divided into child ranges. Further actual identities not fully specified by the conditional children require mandatory refinement and prevent dataset completion; this requirement is not itself a flow exchange. Actual other part numbers/functions and reusable temporary debris/test caps require exact supply/complete-life/native-unit/period/removal ownership; no whole cap consumed every attempt. | `cp_assembly_materials`; actual independent records and identity/unit evidence |

Follow the chosen fitting instructions: sealant for a pipe-thread connection does not imply sealant on its CSST sealing seat. Gross issue is the input convention for consumables also: a real usable return is recorded once in `usable_returns_csst`, and retained stock is only the carried-forward balance. Range evidence need: Collect exact fitting-specific procedure, formulation receipts/use or measured wear, actual repair incidence and retained stock; no assumed sealant dose or loss fraction.

Further actual identities not fully specified by the conditional children require mandatory refinement and prevent dataset completion; this requirement is not itself a flow exchange.

Different actual identities require independent quantities and records, not a summed family exchange. A complete product/carrier includes its contents once. Same unchanged SKU/state usable supply/return pairs and matched physical internal send/receive pairs use the same selected property/unit; kg and count or MJ and kWh auxiliaries are nonadditive measurements, never duplicate exchanges. Missing identity/occurrence/quantity/native reference is a gap, not zero. Any pooled denominator must retain the original accepted configuration strata, state/gate and causal attribution; do not divide unlike circuits, routes, products or jobs as if they were equivalent. | actual identity, unit, custody and independent quantity evidence |
| `asset_final_normalization_once` | all inventory rows | An asset-equivalent formula already ending in division by N, D or A is the final quantity per reference flow. Its complete-life fraction and accepted-output normalization constitute the same normalization operation as the general normalization rule; never divide it by that denominator again.
