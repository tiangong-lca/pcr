# Gasket-jointed external building sanitary drain installation services

## 1. Scope and Applicability

Applies to installation of a six-inch rigid PVC DR35 gasket-jointed gravity sanitary building lateral on private untrafficked bare ground, from an existing outside-building outlet to a prepared authorized existing receiver. The installer owns new bedding, laying, gasket assembly, haunching, actual water testing/correction, complete imported backfill, layer compaction and agreed bare-ground grade through final signed acceptance. The selected route uses manual bar/block insertion and actual manual or grid/battery-electric support equipment. Project design, soil/load conditions, compatible products and competent acceptance criteria must be declared; public manufacturer guidance and local sample notes do not constitute a site design.

| --- | --- | --- | --- | --- |
| reference_path | reference product | Length `838aaa23-0117-11db-92e3-0800200c9a66` | m | D is the sum of uniquely identified final accepted conveyance-path centreline segments, in m, from the declared outside-building outlet datum to the prepared existing receiver datum. Include the centreline traversed through each fitting once; add no socket overlap. Exclude standalone cleanout access-riser length, removed/failed/uninstalled pieces and duplicate or overlapping test sections. Access-riser materials remain in inventory. Reconcile final as-built survey/segment IDs and endpoints; gross delivered, body, cut and laying lengths are separate records. Replacements retire the original ID and receive final IDs; only the final path enters D. |

| resources_and_scope | all inventory rows | Include actual permanent components, every approved imported-fill phase, consumables, packaging source pool, external water/electricity, attributed owned resources and true hired service. Use manual or grid/battery-electric resources only in this route; combustion or live bypass requires reviewed scope change. Mains/new chambers, indoor piping, pavement/road crossing, landscaping beyond bare grade and later operation/treatment are excluded. Landed supply datasets must disclose delivery and packaging boundaries. | `charlotte-dr35`; `charlotte-underground` |
| asset_periods | `owned_equipment_attribution_pump`; `owned_equipment_attribution_compactor`; hired_support_service | Identify actual insertion tools/cutter/compactor/pump/meter/charger and ownership, manufacture/acquisition, all consuming jobs and reporting periods, maintenance/replacement and retirement. Link actual job inputs/events and accepted handover to this common period index; electricity and hired-provider burdens have single owners. Unknown utilization is retained as a gap. |  |

### Process: Complete external drain installation (`external_drain_install`)

Conditional roles expand to zero, one or multiple actual SKU/species/state/recipient exchanges, each separately measured and verified. A heterogeneous sum is a diagnostic ledger, never one exchange identity. Phase readiness, geometry and inspection are observations. All quantities refer to the same final accepted job and D.

#### Inputs

##### Product flows

###### Six-inch DR35 gasketed PVC pipe (`gasketed_dr35_pipe`)

Record net pipe mass at receipt and issue, with usable returns and retained pieces traced to the same SKU.

###### Externally supplied water for actual installation activities (`supplied_water`)

Meter external withdrawal or multiply measured source volume by traceable temperature-specific density. Record water-only testing, cleaning and approved moisture conditioning separately, with batch reuse and retained states. Internal reuse is not withdrawal; moisture already in aggregate or formulation is not extra supplied water. Calculation rule: normalize_exchange. Range evidence need: Need source/quality, actual withdrawal, internal capacity/head geometry, compatible head/hold/venting criteria, retests/leaks/cleaning/reuse and fill moisture adjustments. No fixed water/path-m or fill/discharge ratio.

###### External installation electricity (`installation_electricity`)

Use actual supply-meter interval kWh allocated by complete job/activity records. Attribute battery recharge and charger losses within the stated supply boundary once; battery operation does not add the same energy again. Manual work has no assumed electricity; combustion equipment requires route review. Calculation rule: normalize_exchange. Range evidence need: Need actual tool/pump/compactor power source, meter intervals, shared-load and recharge allocation/efficiency boundary. Rating times unrecorded duration supplies no interval. Exact Energy support remains unverified.

## 7. Allocation and Co-product Handling

| rule_id | Applies to | Rule | source_ids |
| --- | --- | --- | --- |
| single_output | external_drain_install | One intended accepted lateral service; stock returns and residual exits are not intended co-products. Keep actual correction, replacement, extra water test and deficient fill/compaction correction resources in this accepted job, once. Failed and held work is not accepted output. |  |
| return_convention | `usable_stock_returns_pipe`; `usable_stock_returns_gasket`; `usable_stock_returns_lubricant` | Declare gross custody flows plus real returns, or reconcile net resource consumption to those flows. Do not both net issues and deduct the same return again. No default recovery/avoided-product credit follows a waste dispatch or stock return. |  |
| owned_asset_shares | `owned_equipment_attribution_pump`; `owned_equipment_attribution_compactor` | Attribute exact asset manufacture by actual same-basis job/lifetime activity and enumerate every consumer/period. Shares reconcile to 1 over the stated history/remaining-use basis. Maintenance/replacement goes to evidenced benefiting periods or causal job; a matched lifecycle dataset must own it, or correctly typed separate roles require review. Closed assets use closed history; in-service remaining use needs supported estimates and uncertainty. Unknown maintenance/termination blocks finalized attribution. |  |
| resource_nonoverlap | `owned_equipment_attribution_pump`; `owned_equipment_attribution_compactor`; hired_support_service; installation_electricity; actual exchanges required by `refine_incoming_packaging` | Provider service owns rented asset burdens; operator-owned assets are separate. Reconcile manufacture, each maintenance/replacement/retirement event and period share once; do not annualize lifetime-attributed burdens again or assign whole original and replacement assets simultaneously. Meter electricity/charging once. Preserve embedded packaging custody without duplicating its upstream manufacture. |  |

## 8. Foreground Data Collection, Calculation, and Quality Rules

### Data Collection Protocols

| protocol_id | process_id | flow_role | record_type | raw_fields | collection_method | unit | frequency | temporal_coverage | site_scope | aggregation_rule | quality_evidence |
| --- | --- | --- | --- | --- | --- | --- | --- | --- | --- | --- | --- |
| cp_materials | external_drain_install | material/SKU/phase and packaging | actual measured/traceable event records | shipment; SKU/lot/specification; component/phase ID; receipt/issue/return/stock; mass/tare; net factor source; fill moisture/density; packaging owner; concrete_exchange_id; physical_event_id; actual_identity_id; actual_state; receiver_or_provider_gate; native_quantity; native_unit; unique_property; measurement_method_id; uncertainty | Weigh or use validated same-SKU net factors. Reconcile actual pipe/fitting/seal/lubricant/consumable quantities. Keep fill bedding/haunch/initial/upper phases and stock distinct; packaging physical pool and upstream burden owner are separate. Quantity aggregation: actual attributable external quantity / D; internal movement is ledger only Record each actual child/refined exchange independently by identity, physical event, state, gate and period. Retain all original obligations even where a corresponding exchange identity is not yet known. Do not allocate a family total or copy its numerical Range to children, count a carrier and its contained material twice, or turn missing occurrence/quantity/native reference into zero. Each concrete exchange has one property and one unit; other CP readings are auxiliary and require evidenced conversion. Missing required refinement blocks dataset completion. | kg | Each custody/placement event | receipt to final stock/residual closure | one job, every selected shipment and placement phase | per reference flow | calibration; tickets; SKU net evidence; phase placement and supplier boundary |
| cp_water | external_drain_install | external/retained/reused/dispatched water | actual measured/traceable event records | source/quality; volume or meter intervals; density/temperature; batch/reuse IDs; test head/hold/venting; retained inventory; recipient; aggregate/formulation water | Meter external supply and each outgoing/retained batch separately. Weigh or convert with actual density; preserve internal reuse and constituent water in fill/lubricant. Record actual water-only tests, retests, cleaning and approved moisture conditioning; no balance remainder is assigned a fate. Quantity aggregation: each actual external input/output mass / D; internal reuse excluded | kg | Each withdrawal/test/transfer event | first water activity through final retained/recipient closure | one job and all test/placement water batches | per reference flow | meter calibration; batch journal; quality/density evidence; receiver receipt |
| cp_energy | external_drain_install | external tool/pump/compactor/charging energy | actual measured/traceable event records | asset/phase; source/provider; interval start/end kWh; battery charge/activity share; charger boundary; all shared users | Read calibrated supply meters. Allocate shared loads and battery recharge using matching complete activity/charge records; include charger loss only inside stated supply boundary. Do not count battery operation and recharge twice or infer energy for manual work. Combustion equipment requires route review. Quantity aggregation: actual attributable external kWh / D | kWh | Each supply interval and recharge | installation through corrections and final compaction | one job and complete shared-meter interval | per reference flow | meter calibration; charging/share reconciliation; manual/no-electric-use evidence |
| cp_services | external_drain_install | owned asset share and true hired event | actual measured/traceable event records | ownership; model/serial/count; all consumers/jobs/periods; actual and lifetime same-basis activity; manufacture/maintenance/replacement/termination; provider unit/event or hours; upstream readiness IDs; concrete_exchange_id; physical_event_id; actual_identity_id; actual_state; receiver_or_provider_gate; native_quantity; native_unit; unique_property; measurement_method_id; uncertainty | Index manufacture/acquisition, all service periods, actual maintenance/replacement and retirement. Record matched lifecycle dataset inclusions; otherwise review correctly typed maintenance roles. Count only complete accepted provider events; hours keep their true quantity/support gap. Link separately owned excavation/temporaryworks readiness without importing their burdens. Quantity aggregation: asset count × actual job activity/lifetime activity / D; actual accepted event count × job share / D Record each actual child/refined exchange independently by identity, physical event, state, gate and period. Retain all original obligations even where a corresponding exchange identity is not yet known. Do not allocate a family total or copy its numerical Range to children, count a carrier and its contained material twice, or turn missing occurrence/quantity/native reference into zero. Each concrete exchange has one property and one unit; other CP readings are auxiliary and require evidenced conversion. Missing required refinement blocks dataset completion. | Item(s) | Each asset/service/lifecycle event | whole documented asset service history plus job dates | this job and every consuming job/period in asset denominator | per reference flow | asset/period registers; contract/acceptance; lifecycle dataset boundary; remaining-use uncertainty |
| cp_residuals | external_drain_install | material waste and evidenced species release | actual measured/traceable event records | stream/material/species/size/state; gross/tare/composition; source/phase/old/new ID; receiver/medium/subcompartment; measured release or factor/activity/control; concrete_exchange_id; physical_event_id; actual_identity_id; actual_state; receiver_or_provider_gate; native_quantity; native_unit; unique_property; measurement_method_id; uncertainty | Weigh actual exit streams separately by identity and recipient. Trace removed joints and replacement events. Quantify emissions only by specific measurements or a validated matched species/material/control factor with actual activity; distinguish captured waste, retained constituents and direct release. Quantity aggregation: each actual waste/species quantity / D; no automatic residual-to-air assignment Record each actual child/refined exchange independently by identity, physical event, state, gate and period. Retain all original obligations even where a corresponding exchange identity is not yet known. Do not allocate a family total or copy its numerical Range to children, count a carrier and its contained material twice, or turn missing occurrence/quantity/native reference into zero. Each concrete exchange has one property and one unit; other CP readings are auxiliary and require evidenced conversion. Missing required refinement blocks dataset completion. | kg | Each exit/reject/release event | receipt through final correction/dispatch | one job, actual installer-owned releases only | per reference flow | tare/calibration; dispatch tickets; composition; factor applicability and uncertainty |
| cp_acceptance | external_drain_install | final accepted buried conveyance path | actual measured/traceable event records | provided endpoint datums/authorization; trench readiness owner; final path/segment IDs and lengths; fitting/access distinction; visible-joint water test/retest; concealment approval; fill/layer/compaction/grade evidence; signature/date | Survey and reconcile final unique conveyance centreline as reference_path. Record ready trench/endpoints, gasket laying/haunch, exposed-joint compatible water test and correction, competent concealment approval, then full cover/layer compaction and agreed bare-ground grade, then final signed buried-lateral acceptance. Failed or merely cover-ready work contributes no D. Quantity aggregation: final accepted path D / D = 1 m reference flow | m | Each inspection/correction and final survey/handover | ready-trench handoff through signed final acceptance | one actual external outlet-to-receiver path set | per reference flow | as-built survey; test/approval chronology; full backfill/compaction records; final signature |

### Calculation Rules

| rule_id | Applies to | Formula or rule | Inputs | Output | source_ids |
| --- | --- | --- | --- | --- | --- |
| normalize_exchange | all inventory rows | Divide the actual attributable external quantity by D, retaining its own numerator unit and conversion evidence. For the final accepted path, D / D gives 1 m reference flow. Do not repeat internal transfers or embedded supply inputs. | actual external quantity; D; linked collection protocol | quantity per reference flow |  |
| owned_asset_normalize | `owned_equipment_attribution_pump`; `owned_equipment_attribution_compactor` | q_asset_per_m = asset_count × job_activity / lifetime_activity / D. Use the same documented activity basis for all consumers; manufacture once, maintenance/replacement by evidenced benefiting periods or causal job with explicit dataset ownership. | asset_count; job_activity; lifetime_activity; D; cp_services | attributed Item(s) per reference flow |  |
| hired_service_normalize | hired_support_service | q_service_per_m = true_contract_quantity × job_share / D. Here Item(s) applies only to an actual complete defined accepted event. A true hour contract requires reviewed Duration support; preserve hours and the gap. | true_contract_quantity; job_share; D; cp_services | true service quantity per reference flow |  |
| fill_diagnostic | actual exchanges required by `refine_imported_approved_fill` | Keep surveyed phase volumes separate. Prefer weighed fill attributed to each phase; otherwise mass = actual phase volume × validated site/state bulk density with declared moisture convention. Deduct actual pipe displacement where applicable; reconcile all placed phases, returns, stocks and losses once. | phase geometry; ticket mass; density; moisture; cp_materials; cp_acceptance | phase mass diagnostic before normalize_exchange |  |
| release_normalize | actual exchanges required by `refine_airborne_particulate`; water_to_air; actual exchanges required by `refine_other_evidenced_species_release` | Use actual measured species mass / D, or actual matched activity × validated species-specific release factor / D. Identify real medium/subcompartment and controls; unknown partition or unmatched factor remains a gap. | species mass or activity/factor; D; cp_residuals; cp_water | species kg per reference flow |  |
| source_pool_balance | material and constituent ledgers | Opening stock + receipts = closing stock + usable returns + installed retention + captured/recipient waste + evidenced environmental release, with compatible units and uncertainty. Reconcile separate physical material/constituent pools, including packaging custody, aggregate moisture and formulation water; no automatic fate from an imbalance. | stocks; receipts; retention; returns; waste; release; cp_materials; cp_water; cp_residuals | diagnostic physical pool balance |  |

### Data Quality Requirements

| requirement_id | Applies to | Requirement | Evidence |
| --- | --- | --- | --- |
| dq_traceability | all inventory rows | Retain event dates, node ownership, actual SKU/state/recipient, instrument calibration, raw numerator/unit and matched conversion provenance. Unknown occurrence is unknown, not zero. Maintain physical and constituent pools separately with uncertainty. | cp_materials; cp_water; cp_energy; cp_services; cp_residuals; cp_acceptance |
| dq_public_evidence | all inventory rows | Manufacturer shipping points are not net consumption or intervals. Engineering bedding/compaction recommendations and Seattle sample notes require actual site/design adaptation; no default density, water ratio, reject fraction, lubricant dose, lifetime or emission split is established. | charlotte-dr35; charlotte-plastics-manual; seattle-side-sewer-notes-2024 |
| range_gasketed_dr35_pipe | gasketed_dr35_pipe | A comparable quantity interval needs exact gasketed SKU net weight, socket/seal inclusion, cut plan, fitting mix, rejects and returns. The 14 ft and 20 ft gasketed shipping points, 249.6 and 247.0 lb/100 ft, are approximate shipping data, not net installed factors or Range endpoints. | cp_materials |
| range_gasketed_fittings_and_interfaces | `gasketed_fittings_and_interfaces_elbow`; `gasketed_fittings_and_interfaces_branch`; `gasketed_fittings_and_interfaces_terminal`; `gasketed_fittings_and_interfaces_cleanout` | Need endpoint compatibility/approval, as-built fitting and access BOM, SKU weights/seal boundary and actual replacements before any fitting kg/path-m interval. | cp_materials |
| range_replacement_gaskets | replacement_gaskets | Need actual compatible dimensions/material, net mass, extra issue count, replacement cause and destination. ASTM F477 conformity does not identify an elastomer or its mass. | cp_materials |
| range_imported_approved_fill | actual exchanges required by `refine_imported_approved_fill` | Need project soil/load/cover design, phase geometry, material grade, weighed quantity, moisture/density basis, losses and placement acceptance. General 4 in bedding, 6 in on rock, 6 in layers and 85–95% compaction guidance is conditional, not an inventory interval or evidence of site compliance. | cp_materials |
| range_approved_gasket_lubricant | approved_gasket_lubricant | Need approved product/SDS, composition, application mass, density for volume conversion, spills/residues and actual fate/control; no universal kg/joint or kg/m dose is established. | cp_materials |

| range_supplied_water | supplied_water | Need source/quality, actual withdrawal, internal capacity/head geometry, compatible head/hold/venting criteria, retests/leaks/cleaning/reuse and fill moisture adjustments. No fixed water/path-m or fill/discharge ratio. | cp_water |
| range_installation_electricity | installation_electricity | Need actual tool/pump/compactor power source, meter intervals, shared-load and recharge allocation/efficiency boundary. Rating times unrecorded duration supplies no interval. Exact Energy support remains unverified. | cp_energy |
| range_owned_equipment_attribution | `owned_equipment_attribution_pump`; `owned_equipment_attribution_compactor` | Need asset-specific embodied evidence, all consumer/period activity, maintenance/replacement/termination and supported remaining-use uncertainty; no whole tool/job, standard lifetime or generic share interval. | cp_services |
| range_hired_support_service | hired_support_service | Need true contract unit, accepted event definition or hours, provider manufacture/maintenance/fuel/electricity boundary and consumer shares. No generic events/m; hourly Duration support remains unresolved. | cp_services |
| range_accepted_external_drain_connection | accepted_external_drain_connection | Need final surveyed endpoint/path IDs and actual lengths with every acceptance gate; 1 m is a normalization convention, not an empirical yield or material-intensity interval. | cp_acceptance |
| range_usable_stock_returns | `usable_stock_returns_pipe`; `usable_stock_returns_gasket`; `usable_stock_returns_lubricant` | Need actual acceptance/quantity/state and prior issue convention for each returned SKU, including unused fill and lubricant balances; no default return fraction. | cp_materials |
| range_dry_nonusable_residuals | `dry_nonusable_residuals_pipe_offcut` | Need actual cut plan, pack losses, rejected/excess fill destination, collection and mass records; no universal waste percentage or mixed-material exchange. | cp_residuals |
| range_rejected_joint_components | `rejected_joint_components_joint_cutout`; `rejected_joint_components_separate_seal` | Need observed cause, composition/mass, replacement linkage and destination. Recognized gasket displacement risk does not establish a defect rate. | cp_residuals |
| range_contaminated_consumable_residuals | `contaminated_consumable_residuals_container`; `contaminated_consumable_residuals_wipe`; `contaminated_consumable_residuals_loose_formulation` | Need actual SDS/formulation, container/wipe retention, residue quality and recipient requirements; neither a generic VOC nor hazardous fraction is supported. | cp_residuals |
| range_used_water_to_recipient | used_water_to_recipient | Need actual collection/discharge, permission, quality, density and retained/reuse reconciliation. Fresh supply does not automatically equal wastewater. | cp_water |
| range_airborne_particulate | actual exchanges required by `refine_airborne_particulate` | Need composition/size fraction, actual task activity, wetting/enclosure/capture and matched measurement/factor; no total-dust-to-PVC/PM split or universal interval. | cp_residuals |
| range_water_to_air | water_to_air | Need actual exposed area/time/conditions for testing, cleaning or moisture conditioning, validated evaporation and source-pool partition; no default evaporation fraction. | cp_water |
| range_other_evidenced_species_release | actual exchanges required by `refine_other_evidenced_species_release` | Need actual approved lubricant/cleaner SDS, applied mass, species, medium, control and partition/factor evidence. Gasket joining alone implies neither chemical identity nor release quantity. | cp_residuals |
| `refine_gasketed_fittings_and_interfaces` | `gasketed_fittings_and_interfaces_elbow`; `gasketed_fittings_and_interfaces_branch`; `gasketed_fittings_and_interfaces_terminal`; `gasketed_fittings_and_interfaces_cleanout` | Preserve this actual collection and closure scope as a mandatory dataset-production requirement: Reconcile the actual elbow/branch/terminal/cleanout BOM to item counts and measured or same-SKU net mass. Include supplied seals once. Existing authorized endpoints are provided; no new main, chamber or live tapping belongs here. Only the traversed fitting path enters D; access-riser material still enters inventory. Calculation rule: normalize_exchange. Range evidence need: Need endpoint compatibility/approval, as-built fitting and access BOM, SKU weights/seal boundary and actual replacements before any fitting kg/path-m interval. Independently establish every actual identity, state, real provider/receiver and exactly one exchange property/unit before constructing its flow card. Each actual exchange requires its own recorded quantity and applicable method, uncertainty and custody/fate coverage. Auxiliary CP units do not authorize extra exchange views. Actual occurrence unknown is not zero; never invent a material/species/provider list or split a parent total. Quantitative screening evidence must fit each actual exchange; a former family interval cannot be copied or divided into child ranges. Further actual identities not fully specified by the conditional children require mandatory refinement and prevent dataset completion; this requirement is not itself a flow exchange. Actual access-riser material and other adapters/functions require exact SKU/geometry/native unit; complete supplied fittings include seals once. Existing main/chamber/live tapping outside scope, only traversed fitting path enters service D. | `cp_materials`; actual independent records and identity/unit evidence |
| `refine_imported_approved_fill` | actual independently refined exchanges | Preserve this actual collection and closure scope as a mandatory dataset-production requirement: Use weighed tickets and stock/return/placement records. Distinguish bedding, haunch, initial cover and upper backfill even if the same material serves several phases. If converting surveyed volume, validate actual state-specific density and moisture; account pipe displacement, trench geometry and compaction. Excavated soil remains with the excavation supplier. Calculation rule: normalize_exchange. Range evidence need: Need project soil/load/cover design, phase geometry, material grade, weighed quantity, moisture/density basis, losses and placement acceptance. General 4 in bedding, 6 in on rock, 6 in layers and 85–95% compaction guidance is conditional, not an inventory interval or evidence of site compliance. Independently establish every actual identity, state, real provider/receiver and exactly one exchange property/unit before constructing its flow card. Each actual exchange requires its own recorded quantity and applicable method, uncertainty and custody/fate coverage. Auxiliary CP units do not authorize extra exchange views. Actual occurrence unknown is not zero; never invent a material/species/provider list or split a parent total. Quantitative screening evidence must fit each actual exchange; a former family interval cannot be copied or divided into child ranges. Further actual identities not fully specified by the conditional children require mandatory refinement and prevent dataset completion; this requirement is not itself a flow exchange. Actual independently supplied approved material/grade/moisture/state and unique Mass/kg quantity; same physical material used several phases recorded once with phase activity. Independent density/moisture/geometry/pipe displacement needed for volume bridge, excavated soil excavation-supplier owned. | `cp_materials`; actual independent records and identity/unit evidence |
| `refine_cleaning_and_protection_consumables` | actual independently refined exchanges | Preserve this actual collection and closure scope as a mandatory dataset-production requirement: Record consumed SKU quantities from issues/returns and container deltas or validated article count-to-mass factors, linked to the cleaned object and event. Include only actual activities; reusable protection is equipment and solvent cleaner is not presumed. Calculation rule: normalize_exchange. Range evidence need: Need actual objects/frequency, product dose or article mass/composition, stock and captured residues; no generic cleaning kg/m interval. Independently establish every actual identity, state, real provider/receiver and exactly one exchange property/unit before constructing its flow card. Each actual exchange requires its own recorded quantity and applicable method, uncertainty and custody/fate coverage. Auxiliary CP units do not authorize extra exchange views. Actual occurrence unknown is not zero; never invent a material/species/provider list or split a parent total. Quantitative screening evidence must fit each actual exchange; a former family interval cannot be copied or divided into child ranges. Further actual identities not fully specified by the conditional children require mandatory refinement and prevent dataset completion; this requirement is not itself a flow exchange. Actual expendable SKU/function/material/state and independent issue/return/count-mass/container-delta method; reusable protection equipment separate, no presumed solvent cleaner. | `cp_materials`; actual independent records and identity/unit evidence |
| `refine_incoming_packaging` | actual independently refined exchanges | Preserve this actual collection and closure scope as a mandatory dataset-production requirement: Measure shipment-linked package mass or same-batch counts/tares and reconcile stock, reuse, returns and waste. Instantiate a burden input only where landed supply excludes that packaging burden; otherwise retain physical custody in the ledger without repeating manufacture. Calculation rule: normalize_exchange. Range evidence need: Need actual packaging material/weight and supplier boundary by shipment; even absence on bulk fill needs evidence. Packaging waste cannot stand in for a missing incoming source pool. Independently establish every actual identity, state, real provider/receiver and exactly one exchange property/unit before constructing its flow card. Each actual exchange requires its own recorded quantity and applicable method, uncertainty and custody/fate coverage. Auxiliary CP units do not authorize extra exchange views. Actual occurrence unknown is not zero; never invent a material/species/provider list or split a parent total. Quantitative screening evidence must fit each actual exchange; a former family interval cannot be copied or divided into child ranges. Further actual identities not fully specified by the conditional children require mandatory refinement and prevent dataset completion; this requirement is not itself a flow exchange. Actual shipment-linked packaging material/count/tare; burden input only where supplier gate excludes manufacture, otherwise physical ledger; stock/reuse/return/waste closure. | `cp_materials`; actual independent records and identity/unit evidence |
| `refine_owned_equipment_attribution` | `owned_equipment_attribution_pump`; `owned_equipment_attribution_compactor` | Preserve this actual collection and closure scope as a mandatory dataset-production requirement: Record exact model/serial/count and actual job activity against documented same-basis lifetime activity across every consuming job/period. Allocate manufacture once; maintain actual manufacture, maintenance, replacement and retirement boundaries. A matching lifecycle dataset must explicitly include maintenance; otherwise correctly typed maintenance roles need review. Do not convert maintenance mass or hours into an asset count. Calculation rule: owned_asset_normalize. Range evidence need: Need asset-specific embodied evidence, all consumer/period activity, maintenance/replacement/termination and supported remaining-use uncertainty; no whole tool/job, standard lifetime or generic share interval. Independently establish every actual identity, state, real provider/receiver and exactly one exchange property/unit before constructing its flow card. Each actual exchange requires its own recorded quantity and applicable method, uncertainty and custody/fate coverage. Auxiliary CP units do not authorize extra exchange views. Actual occurrence unknown is not zero; never invent a material/species/provider list or split a parent total. Quantitative screening evidence must fit each actual exchange; a former family interval cannot be copied or divided into child ranges. Further actual identities not fully specified by the conditional children require mandatory refinement and prevent dataset completion; this requirement is not itself a flow exchange. Other owned reusable tool/resource functions require exact function/model/serial/life-reference. Each uses owned_asset_normalize = asset_count*job_activity/lifetime_activity/D, all consumers and actual maintenance/retirement ownership; rented assets not owned. | `cp_services`; actual independent records and identity/unit evidence |
| `refine_usable_stock_returns` | `usable_stock_returns_pipe`; `usable_stock_returns_gasket`; `usable_stock_returns_lubricant` | Preserve this actual collection and closure scope as a mandatory dataset-production requirement: Weigh returned stock or use a validated same-SKU conversion; link original issue, unchanged usable state and receiving receipt. Keep pipe, seal, fill, lubricant and packaging returns separate. Choose a consistent gross issue/return or net-issue convention so the same return is not deducted twice. Calculation rule: normalize_exchange. Range evidence need: Need actual acceptance/quantity/state and prior issue convention for each returned SKU, including unused fill and lubricant balances; no default return fraction. Independently establish every actual identity, state, real provider/receiver and exactly one exchange property/unit before constructing its flow card. Each actual exchange requires its own recorded quantity and applicable method, uncertainty and custody/fate coverage. Auxiliary CP units do not authorize extra exchange views. Actual occurrence unknown is not zero; never invent a material/species/provider list or split a parent total. Quantitative screening evidence must fit each actual exchange; a former family interval cannot be copied or divided into child ranges. Further actual identities not fully specified by the conditional children require mandatory refinement and prevent dataset completion; this requirement is not itself a flow exchange.

| `refine_dry_nonusable_residuals` | `dry_nonusable_residuals_pipe_offcut` | Preserve this actual collection and closure scope as a mandatory dataset-production requirement: Weigh each collected dry stream with tare, composition, source-pool and recipient ticket. Pipe offcuts, packaging and actual fill losses remain separate identities. Retained fill and reusable packaging are not waste. Calculation rule: normalize_exchange. Range evidence need: Need actual cut plan, pack losses, rejected/excess fill destination, collection and mass records; no universal waste percentage or mixed-material exchange. Independently establish every actual identity, state, real provider/receiver and exactly one exchange property/unit before constructing its flow card. Each actual exchange requires its own recorded quantity and applicable method, uncertainty and custody/fate coverage. Auxiliary CP units do not authorize extra exchange views.

Reseating without an external material exit is a correction event, not waste. Retired pieces cannot enter D. Calculation rule: normalize_exchange. Range evidence need: Need observed cause, composition/mass, replacement linkage and destination. Recognized gasket displacement risk does not establish a defect rate. Independently establish every actual identity, state, real provider/receiver and exactly one exchange property/unit before constructing its flow card. Each actual exchange requires its own recorded quantity and applicable method, uncertainty and custody/fate coverage. Auxiliary CP units do not authorize extra exchange views. Actual occurrence unknown is not zero; never invent a material/species/provider list or split a parent total. Quantitative screening evidence must fit each actual exchange; a former family interval cannot be copied or divided into child ranges. Further actual identities not fully specified by the conditional children require mandatory refinement and prevent dataset completion; this requirement is not itself a flow exchange. Different actual damaged components/material/receiver states require exact records; link original/removal/replacement/test IDs, retired pieces not service D. | `cp_residuals`; actual independent records and identity/unit evidence |
| `refine_contaminated_consumable_residuals` | `contaminated_consumable_residuals_container`; `contaminated_consumable_residuals_wipe`; `contaminated_consumable_residuals_loose_formulation` | Preserve this actual collection and closure scope as a mandatory dataset-production requirement: Measure container/wipe tare and collected formulation residue, keeping composition, classification and receiver. Reconcile applied, retained, captured and released constituent pools. Actual acceptance conditions determine waste classification; do not assume hazardous status or emission. Calculation rule: normalize_exchange. Range evidence need: Need actual SDS/formulation, container/wipe retention, residue quality and recipient requirements; neither a generic VOC nor hazardous fraction is supported. Independently establish every actual identity, state, real provider/receiver and exactly one exchange property/unit before constructing its flow card. Each actual exchange requires its own recorded quantity and applicable method, uncertainty and custody/fate coverage. Auxiliary CP units do not authorize extra exchange views. Actual occurrence unknown is not zero; never invent a material/species/provider list or split a parent total. Quantitative screening evidence must fit each actual exchange; a former family interval cannot be copied or divided into child ranges. Further actual identities not fully specified by the conditional children require mandatory refinement and prevent dataset completion; this requirement is not itself a flow exchange. Actual composition/state/classification/receiver differences require separate records, no presumed hazard/emission; applied/retained/captured/released pools disjoint. | `cp_residuals`; actual independent records and identity/unit evidence |
| `refine_airborne_particulate` | actual independently refined exchanges | Preserve this actual collection and closure scope as a mandatory dataset-production requirement: Quantify exact material/size-specific release by monitoring or a validated factor matched to actual cutting, fill handling or compaction activity and controls. Specify receiving air subcompartment. Captured dust is waste; excavation-provider releases and unexplained mass differences are excluded. Calculation rule: release_normalize. Range evidence need: Need composition/size fraction, actual task activity, wetting/enclosure/capture and matched measurement/factor; no total-dust-to-PVC/PM split or universal interval. Independently establish every actual identity, state, real provider/receiver and exactly one exchange property/unit before constructing its flow card.

Actual substance, disjoint particle-size fraction and air/water/soil receiving compartment; matched measurement or species/activity factor, whole-fluid composition/fate audit, capture and uncertainty; unknown is not zero. | `cp_residuals`; actual independent records and identity/unit evidence |
| `refine_other_evidenced_species_release` | actual independently refined exchanges | Preserve this actual collection and closure scope as a mandatory dataset-production requirement: Instantiate only an identified chemical species and actual medium/subcompartment. Measure its mass or use verified composition, applied activity and matched release/fate factor; reconcile installed film, captured residue and recipient transfer. Air, water and soil are separate exchanges; recipient wastewater is not elementary release. Calculation rule: release_normalize. Range evidence need: Need actual approved lubricant/cleaner SDS, applied mass, species, medium, control and partition/factor evidence. Gasket joining alone implies neither chemical identity nor release quantity. Independently establish every actual identity, state, real provider/receiver and exactly one exchange property/unit before constructing its flow card. Each actual exchange requires its own recorded quantity and applicable method, uncertainty and custody/fate coverage. Auxiliary CP units do not authorize extra exchange views.

| `atomic_exchange_identity_unit` | all inventory rows | Each concrete flow card identifies exactly one actual independently supplied product/SKU/formulation, complete assembly, complete single-function or genuine complete bounded provider service, actual waste composite/state/receiver, or substance/size/receiving medium, with exactly one property and unit. Different actual identities require independent quantities and records, not a summed family exchange. A complete product/carrier includes its contents once. Same unchanged SKU/state usable supply/return pairs and matched physical internal send/receive pairs use the same selected property/unit; kg and count or MJ and kWh auxiliaries are nonadditive measurements, never duplicate exchanges. Missing identity/occurrence/quantity/native reference is a gap, not zero. Any pooled denominator must retain the original accepted configuration strata, state/gate and causal attribution; do not divide unlike circuits, routes, products or jobs as if they were equivalent. | actual identity, unit, custody and independent quantity evidence |
| `asset_final_normalization_once` | all inventory rows | An asset-equivalent formula already ending in division by N, D or A is the final quantity per reference flow. Its complete-life fraction and accepted-output normalization constitute the same normalization operation as the general normalization rule; never divide it by that denominator again. Apply the complete-life upstream burden exactly once. Actual complete provider event counts remain event quantities, not owned-asset fractions. | actual identity, unit, custody and independent quantity evidence |

## 9. Validation Rules

| rule_id | Applies to | Rule | source_ids |
| --- | --- | --- | --- |
| validate_scope_gate | reference product | Require declared external endpoints, approved six-inch gasketed DR35 specification and trench/temporaryworks owners. Check exposed-joint water test and concealment approval precede full cover; full cover, compaction, bare-ground grade and final signature precede accepted output. Do not apply air/gas testing or solvent-route cure conditions. |  |
| validate_reference | accepted_external_drain_connection | Verify D > 0 under reference_path and cp_acceptance. Include fitting path once, no socket overlap or cleanout access riser; reject gross-cut substitution, duplicate tests and retired failed pieces. All card numerators use the same accepted-job D. |  |
| validate_rework | `rejected_joint_components_joint_cutout`; `rejected_joint_components_separate_seal`; external_drain_install | Link damaged/misaligned/leaking/displaced-seal joint or failed fill/grade event to its original resource issue, correction/reseat/replacement, test/reapproval and final path/phase ID. Classify real usable return, nonusable waste and captured residue with recipients; internal correction without exit is an event. Keep correction burdens and exclude failed work from D. |  |
| validate_quantities | all inventory rows | Require actual SKU/state/recipient instances with compatible units, linked node-owned protocol, raw numerator and conversion evidence. Check fill phases and integral/replacement seals once; water batches/constituents and retained/recipient/environmental states exclusive.

| validate_identity_evidence | all inventory rows | Final downstream exchanges require verified concrete identities and property/unit compatibility. Candidate names are not binding. Resolve exact Energy support for electricity and Duration support for a real hourly service before using those exchanges.
