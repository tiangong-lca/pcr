# Epoxy injection repair of dormant cracks in existing transport tunnel concrete lining

## 1. Scope and Applicability

This PCR covers pressure injection of an engineer-qualified dormant crack in the retained concrete lining of an existing road or rail transport tunnel using an actual compatible low-viscosity two-component epoxy. It includes job-specific access/protection, cause and movement assessment, cleaning/preparation, surface seal and ports, dosing/mixing, injection, purge/cleanup, required cure, inspection, defect closure and signed repair acceptance. The retained lining remains in place.

Exclude new tunnels or linings, mining/water tunnels, active moving cracks, injection under hydrostatic pressure or with standing water, elastic polyurethane waterstop grouting, major concrete replacement, structural strengthening, tunnel traffic operation and later repair. The dormant-crack subset is a PCR boundary requiring engineer approval, not a claim that the example PDS proves every moving crack impossible. Neither resin laboratory strength nor acceptance of this bounded job guarantees restored structural capacity, watertightness or remaining tunnel life.

The US Sikadur52 PDS read here is Edition 9.23.2014, currently linked by the US product page. It supplies route evidence, not universal contemporary settings. Actual current regional product/label/SDS, approved method and owner requirements govern the concrete job; retain their revision dates and suitability approval. No universal injection pressure, port spacing, component density, mass ratio, kg/m or cure duration is prescribed. [Sources: `un-cpc3-2025`; `sika-sikadur52-us-2014`.]

## 4. Measurement and Unit Rules

| rule_id | Applies to | Required property | Required unit | Rule |
| --- | --- | --- | --- | --- |
| `unique_length` | reference product | Length `838aaa23-0117-11db-92e3-0800200c9a66` | m | L is the measured accepted unique treated crack path from cp_acceptance. Segment unions remove overlap and repeat injection; count branches once by approved map. Tunnel centreline length, ports, sides and passes do not multiply L. No positive reference output if L is zero or acceptance incomplete. |
| `component_conversion` | resin_a; hardener_b; atomic_seal_paste; cleaner; water; fuel | Mass | kg | Use net material mass after actual container/vehicle tare, before outward returns. Convert actual supplied volume only with material-specific measured or supplier-evidenced density at recorded temperature/state and compatible units. Record A/B volume dosing independently; a volume ratio is not a mass ratio. Geometry alone does not prove void volume or absorbed resin. |
| `utilities_units` | electricity; purchased_air; transport | Actual exchange property | kWh; m3; kg*km | Preserve metered energy units and supply boundary. Purchased-air volume must record pressure, temperature, reference conditions and unit; on-site compressor energy and purchased air are mutually exclusive for the same air. Transport uses net cargo kg times actual km; t*km equals 1000 kg*km only with compatible support and units. |
| `emission_units` | atomic_direct_species; atomic_fluid_release | Mass | kg | Record identified substance, receiving medium, actual measured/modelled basis and capture/retention/reaction terms. Separate whole uncontained fluid from partial reported species; 100% solids does not establish zero emissions. Unknown residual is not an emission. |

| starting_condition_role | Retained host condition; no new lining exchange or replacement credit |
| product_classification_scope | Bounded transport tunnel repair service; water/mining tunnel works excluded |
| recursive_input_rule | If a subcontract supplies the same-category repair, record its actual bounded accepted service and declared boundary; use its upstream dataset without recursively recreating identical operations or duplicating our materials/utilities |
| upstream_dataset_requirement | Actual supplied component/consumable, utility, transport, asset and waste-treatment datasets require matching product/state/geography/period and declared included packaging/service boundary |
| disclosure | Declare retained host, all preparation and test work, campaign/batch/period boundary, actual supplier gates, custody, transport legs, shared assets, rejects and any omitted/unmeasured exchanges with consequences |

## 6. Process Inventory Structure

### Process Map

| process_id | process_name | inclusion | inclusion_condition | role | quantitative_reference |
| --- | --- | --- | --- | --- | --- |
| crack_treatment | Integrated qualification, material treatment, injection, cure and repair acceptance | required | Within qualified dormant-crack transport tunnel repair boundary | foreground material treatment in a finite campaign and actual mixing/injection batches | Accepted unique treated crack path L m |

### Process: Integrated crack treatment and acceptance (`crack_treatment`)

The prestate is retained engineer-qualified dormant cracked lining. The output is the injected, cured and verified bounded repair at signed acceptance. Surface sealing, component mixing, waiting and inspection have no separately evidenced physical handoff here. Setup, purge and failed batches/rework remain owned by this node; rejects become accepted only after closed defects and required verification.

###### Preparation abrasive (`consumables_abrasive`)

One independently identified preparation abrasive. This is a conditional independent object supported within the original consumables scope; activate only when actually independently supplied, used or dispatched. Keep actual SKU, material/formulation, specification, state and provider or receiver. Preserve complete supplied products, formulations, assemblies, bounded services and actual mixed-waste carriers as whole views; do not add their already included constituents.

Waste retains its producing node, actual contamination/state, receiver and treatment boundary and is not an environmental emission. The same physical cable or SKU serving several duties is counted once, with duty observations nonadditive. Evidence is required for nonoccurrence; this card assumes no occurrence, composition, count or loss factor.

Original role-specific boundary and operating constraints apply only to this independent child; the former family/screen text is neither another exchange nor an inherited Range: Conditional: expand into separately identified abrasive, wipe, filter, masking/protection, spill absorbent, cleanup/containment supply or minor repair materials actually supplied; heterogeneous materials never become one summed exchange. Avoid duplication with equipment maintenance or supplier coverage.

###### Injection pump asset equivalent (`equipment_share_pump`)

One independently identified injection pump asset equivalent. This is a conditional independent object supported within the original equipment_share scope; activate only when actually independently supplied, used or dispatched. Keep actual SKU, material/formulation, specification, state and provider or receiver. Preserve complete supplied products, formulations, assemblies, bounded services and actual mixed-waste carriers as whole views; do not add their already included constituents. Usable outward exits match the original input property/unit and require actual custody transfer; closing stock is not an exit and usable original-state items are not waste. Waste retains its producing node, actual contamination/state, receiver and treatment boundary and is not an environmental emission. The same physical cable or SKU serving several duties is counted once, with duty observations nonadditive. Evidence is required for nonoccurrence; this card assumes no occurrence, composition, count or loss factor.

Original role-specific boundary and operating constraints apply only to this independent child; the former family/screen text is neither another exchange nor an inherited Range: Expand each actual injection pump/mixer, compressor, access/protection and ventilation asset into its own matched service share. No physical new machine enters solely because a burden fraction is attributed.

###### Captured contaminated concrete debris (`concrete_debris_contaminated`)

One independently identified captured contaminated concrete debris. This is a conditional independent object supported within the original concrete_debris scope; activate only when actually independently supplied, used or dispatched. Keep actual SKU, material/formulation, specification, state and provider or receiver. Preserve complete supplied products, formulations, assemblies, bounded services and actual mixed-waste carriers as whole views; do not add their already included constituents. Usable outward exits match the original input property/unit and require actual custody transfer; closing stock is not an exit and usable original-state items are not waste. Waste retains its producing node, actual contamination/state, receiver and treatment boundary and is not an environmental emission. The same physical cable or SKU serving several duties is counted once, with duty observations nonadditive. Evidence is required for nonoccurrence; this card assumes no occurrence, composition, count or loss factor.

Original role-specific boundary and operating constraints apply only to this independent child; the former family/screen text is neither another exchange nor an inherited Range: Conditional: collected debris from actual bounded preparation or minor job-caused remedies; retained host is not entirely demolished. Expand contaminated and clean destination-specific wastes separately.

##### Elementary flows



## 7. Allocation and Co-product Handling

| rule_id | Applies to | Rule | source_ids |
| --- | --- | --- | --- |
| `accepted_campaign` | crack_treatment | Directly assign finite campaign and batch inputs, outputs, setup/changeover, purge/cleaning and all failed injection/cure/test/rework to the accepted unique crack path L. Reject unresolved or zero-L jobs as incomplete, not zero-burden service. Branches/repeat passes never multiply output. Shared campaign events have one owner; use measured causal time/activity for different jobs with documented reconciliation, never resin value as default allocation. |  |
| `return_and_stock_burden` | resin_a; hardener_b; atomic_seal_paste; injection_ports; cleaner; water; consumables_abrasive; consumables_wipe; consumables_filter; consumables_masking; consumables_absorbent; consumables_containment; consumables_repair; atomic_consumables; fuel; product_returns_resin_a; product_returns_hardener_b; product_returns_seal; product_returns_cleaner; product_returns_fuel; atomic_product_returns; port_returns | Track separate physical and upstream-burden ledgers by lot/state/period: opening stock retains its carried burden, new gross receipts introduce matching burden, outward returns transfer declared actual burden, and retained closing stock carries burden forward without outward exchange. Job-assigned burden plus outgoing transfer burden plus closing burden must reconcile opening plus new burden. Internal issue is not an additional purchased receipt. No automatic return/recycling/avoided-production credit. |  |
| `shared_asset_life` | equipment_share_pump; equipment_share_mixer; equipment_share_compressor; equipment_share_access; equipment_share_protection; equipment_share_ventilation; atomic_equipment_share | For each asset enumerate all jobs, nodes and periods, including this node; use measured compatible service driver to assign one complete-life burden share. Completed lives use observed service and retirement; in-service lives combine observed history and justified prospective remaining service/replacements/termination/EOL, labelled and sourced with uncertainty, sensitivity and updates. Missing scope/denominator blocks finalisation. Do not duplicate direct operating fuel, separately counted spare/consumable/tool coverage or another asset/rental dataset. |  |
| `period_and_reject` | crack_treatment | Link preparation, batches, injection, cure/protection, verification and defect closure to actual periods and the same job. Unused returned products retain identity/custody; failed or discarded materials take actual product-return, rework or waste paths. No rejected material or incomplete repair contributes accepted length. Common equipment and stock crossing periods carry one linked burden balance, not repeated charges. |  |


## 8. Foreground Data Collection, Calculation, and Quality Rules

All quantities are produced from actual records per accepted L; conditional semantic cards expand into each distinct actual exchange identity before downstream dataset finalisation. Absence requires evidence, not an assumed zero. Raw fields preserve explicit measurement units and actual tolerance sources.

Internal quantities remain unnormalized physical amounts, divided by the original reference denominator only at each card final step; parent-role sums are QA only. Physical incident ledger only: incident_total_kg is the measured affected whole-fluid mass before recovery, capture, retention and environmental release, excluding ordinary intended application outside this incident. uncontained_wholefluid_kg = incident_total_kg + reaction_terms_kg - recovered_product_kg - captured_waste_kg - retained_kg. All final pools use the same incident, cutoff, material basis and net-mass unit and are mutually exclusive. retained_kg is independently measured material remaining inside the technosphere outside recovered product and captured waste, including attached residue; retained storage must not be counted again in either outlet. reaction_terms_kg is only an independently evidenced signed net addition/removal of mass across the defined tracked-fluid basis due to actual reaction, with the counterpart and state conversion recorded; it is not a closure residual, a second constituent fraction or an assumed loss. Evidence of no reaction permits zero; unknown retention, reaction or any further fate blocks this balance-derived route and requires complete fate evidence or independent release measurement. For each identified constituent/medium elementary exchange use measured released constituent kg / L, or independently supported uncontained_wholefluid_kg times evidenced constituent mass fraction times actual medium-specific release/fate fraction / L. Retain composition/state and fate evidence at the release state; already released species mass gets no second fraction.

### Calculation Rules

| rule_id | Applies to | Formula or rule | Inputs | Output | source_ids |
| --- | --- | --- | --- | --- | --- |
| `accepted_union` | accepted_crack_repair | L = length of union of accepted unique crack segments in m; normalized reference output amount = 1 m; exclude rejected/incomplete segments and repeat passes. | cp_acceptance; accepted segment map | L m and 1 m reference service |  |
| `job_intensity` | resin_a; hardener_b; atomic_seal_paste; injection_ports; cleaner; water; consumables_abrasive; consumables_wipe; consumables_filter; consumables_masking; consumables_absorbent; consumables_containment; consumables_repair; atomic_consumables; electricity; fuel; purchased_air; product_returns_resin_a; product_returns_hardener_b; product_returns_seal; product_returns_cleaner; product_returns_fuel; atomic_product_returns; port_returns; concrete_debris_clean; concrete_debris_contaminated; atomic_concrete_debris; epoxy_waste_resin_a; epoxy_waste_hardener_b; epoxy_waste_mixed_uncured; epoxy_waste_mixed_cured; epoxy_waste_seal; epoxy_waste_purge; epoxy_waste_wipe; epoxy_waste_filter; atomic_epoxy_waste; wastewater; packaging_waste_container; packaging_waste_packaging; packaging_waste_port; atomic_packaging_waste | For each separately identified exchange, intensity = attributable actual campaign amount / L; L is accepted unique crack path in m. Keep campaign failed/repeated work in numerator; no output if L is zero. | cp_acceptance; cp_material; cp_utilities; cp_waste; actual exchange amounts | Each actual exchange unit per 1 m accepted crack path |  |
| `net_and_volume` | resin_a; hardener_b; atomic_seal_paste; cleaner; water; fuel; wastewater; atomic_fluid_release | Net mass = gross mass - actual container/vehicle tare before outward return deduction. When required, mass kg = actual volume times identity/state/temperature-specific density with evidenced unit conversion; count mass = actual count times measured matching unit mass. Volume dosing ratio is checked in its original units, never assumed to be a mass ratio. | cp_material; cp_utilities; cp_waste; cp_emissions; actual density and units | Traceable net mass and actual original dosing record |  |
| `material_custody` | resin_a; hardener_b; atomic_seal_paste; injection_ports; cleaner; water; consumables_abrasive; consumables_wipe; consumables_filter; consumables_masking; consumables_absorbent; consumables_containment; consumables_repair; atomic_consumables; product_returns_resin_a; product_returns_hardener_b; product_returns_seal; product_returns_cleaner; product_returns_fuel; atomic_product_returns; port_returns | For each lot/state in consistent physical units, opening stock + new gross net-of-tare receipts = installed/retained material + outward unused returns + captured waste + actual uncontained whole-fluid release + retained closing stock + evidenced reaction/other terms, with uncertainty stated. Installed/retained material excludes every separately recorded loss/outlet; actual dosed/used quantity is intermediate activity, never an additive final destination. Opening-stock internal issues are movements, not additional receipts. For expendable ports reconcile the same mutually exclusive destinations in Item(s). Opening burden + new burden = job-assigned burden + outward transferred burden + closing carried-forward burden. | cp_material; cp_waste; cp_emissions; custody and burden ledgers | Physical and upstream-burden closure by lot/period |  |
| `fuel_activity` | fuel; atomic_direct_species; atomic_fluid_release | Burned fuel kg = opening fuel + gross net-of-tare new fuel - closing fuel - unused outward return - captured fuel waste - uncontained whole-fluid fuel - evidenced other nonburned outlet. Reconcile the incident total under fluid_partition, including independently evidenced retained material and any supported signed reaction term at the same cutoff. Assign each retained fuel fate once to closing fuel or the separately evidenced other nonburned outlet; never subtract it in both. Actual recovered product takes its documented final stock/return fate, not an additional deduction. Total spill is audit-only and is not subtracted again; unknown fate blocks derived burn. | cp_utilities; cp_waste; cp_emissions | Burned kg and reconciled fluid outlets; intensity divided by L |  |
| `freight_activity` | transport | For each leg, transport intensity = actual net cargo kg times actual km times evidenced job share / L. Preserve compatible provider boundary and kg*km reference; conversion from t*km multiplies by 1000 only with confirmed support. | cp_transport; cp_acceptance | kg*km per 1 m accepted crack path |  |
| `asset_fraction` | equipment_share_pump; equipment_share_mixer; equipment_share_compressor; equipment_share_access; equipment_share_protection; equipment_share_ventilation; atomic_equipment_share | For each asset, intensity Item(s) equivalent = (attributable job service / complete-life all-consumer service) / L; multiply the fraction by matching complete-life manufacture/maintenance/replacement/EOL burden. Service numerator and denominator use the same actual driver unit. Observed and justified future portions and overlaps remain explicit. | cp_assets; cp_acceptance; complete-life burden scope | Asset-specific equivalent fraction and burden per 1 m accepted crack path |  |
| `species_release` | atomic_direct_species | For each routine substance/medium/event, intensity kg = actual measured release kg / L, or actual compatible activity times documented substance-specific factor times applicable uncaptured fraction / L. Use burned fuel activity when factor requires combustion; account retention/capture/reaction explicitly without assumed 100% solids zero. Exclude incident constituent exchanges assigned to fluid_release; one owner per substance/medium/event, never a generic mixed-formulation elementary exchange. | cp_emissions; cp_utilities; cp_acceptance; actual factor/measurement and controls | Species/medium-specific kg per 1 m accepted crack path |  |
| `fluid_partition` | atomic_fluid_release | Physical incident ledger only: incident_total_kg is the measured affected whole-fluid mass before recovery, capture, retention and environmental release, excluding ordinary intended application outside this incident. uncontained_wholefluid_kg = incident_total_kg + reaction_terms_kg - recovered_product_kg - captured_waste_kg - retained_kg. All final pools use the same incident, cutoff, material basis and net-mass unit and are mutually exclusive. retained_kg is independently measured material remaining inside the technosphere outside recovered product and captured waste, including attached residue; retained storage must not be counted again in either outlet. reaction_terms_kg is only an independently evidenced signed net addition/removal of mass across the defined tracked-fluid basis due to actual reaction, with the counterpart and state conversion recorded; it is not a closure residual, a second constituent fraction or an assumed loss. Evidence of no reaction permits zero; unknown retention, reaction or any further fate blocks this balance-derived route and requires complete fate evidence or independent release measurement. For each identified constituent/medium elementary exchange use measured released constituent kg / L, or independently supported uncontained_wholefluid_kg times evidenced constituent mass fraction times actual medium-specific release/fate fraction / L. Retain composition/state and fate evidence at the release state; already released species mass gets no second fraction.

Materials retain original CP per-identity/state gross/net stock and outward-return conventions; transfers use actual paired custody quantity; usable exits and wastes use independent actual fate quantities. Owned assets use this PCR original job_driver/full_life_driver complete-life asset-equivalent method including manufacture, maintenance, replacement and end of life, with complete every-consumer positive denominator. Purchased services use only actual complete physical tasks whose real contract defines Item(s), with original actual attribution; hours, days and prices cannot become event counts. atomic_child_intensity = independent_physical_quantity / L, where L is unique finally accepted crack path union length in m under the original acceptance rule; L=0 blocks normalization. Non-exchange parent role ledgers and original CP operands retain their stock, transfer, closure and ownership functions, without adding a second exchange or changing the method. | atomic_flow_row_id; independent_physical_quantity; exchange_property; exchange_unit; L; cp_material; cp_assets; cp_waste; cp_emissions | atomic_child_intensity |  |

### Data Quality Requirements

| requirement_id | Applies to | Requirement | Evidence |
| --- | --- | --- | --- |
| `gate_quality` | accepted_crack_repair | Trace actual dormant cause/movement assessment, sound compatible substrate and moisture/pressure prestate, actual seal cure and product suitability; record injection/cure/verification units, actual thresholds/tolerances and dated owner source. All defects closed before signed length acceptance. | cp_acceptance; sika-sikadur52-us-2014 |
| `separate_identity` | all inventory rows | Every actual material, utility, waste and emission needs concrete identity/state/supplier or receiver, actual property/unit and verified final UUID. Conditional cards require disaggregation before dataset finalisation; unresolved is not verified absence. | Actual labels/SDS/custody and detail/support verification |
| `range_quality` | all inventory rows | Collect actual geometry, uptake, batch/setup/purge/waste/utility and shared-equipment evidence before proposing quantitative intensity ranges. Exact 1 m definition is not an empirical yield prior; example laboratory data are not universal field performance or consumption. | Linked protocols and range evidence need on every card |
| `closure_quality` | all inventory rows | Reconcile physical, custody and upstream-burden balances; report measurement precision, missingness and uncertainty. No generic residual emission, closing-stock output, net-then-return double count or hidden duplicate supplier/asset/service boundary. | cp_material; cp_utilities; cp_waste; cp_emissions; cp_assets |
| `life_quality` | equipment_share_pump; equipment_share_mixer; equipment_share_compressor; equipment_share_access; equipment_share_protection; equipment_share_ventilation; atomic_equipment_share | All consumer periods and complete-life coverage/denominator require evidence. In-service future scenarios must be justified, labelled and sensitivity-tested, with update triggers; missing coverage blocks finalisation. | cp_assets |
| `period_quality` | crack_treatment | Preserve repair campaign, mix/injection batch, failed/rework links and preparation/injection/cure/acceptance dates; reconcile stock/asset carry across periods and keep one owner for shared event burdens. | All node protocols |
| atomic_seal_paste | crack_treatment; cp_material | Former seal_paste is a mandatory non-exchange refinement scope and custody/closure ledger key, not a mixed quantity-bearing inventory card. Preserve the original scope: Record each actual surface-seal formulation at its supply state, including its separately supplied components when relevant; seal cure before injection is a gate, not a separate product. Named children cover only the listed conditional objects; every other real independent object remains required in the actual register. At this node use the original CP to collect each object's identity/state/medium or receiver, one fixed property/unit, independent quantity/conversion, activation or evidenced absence, source-ledger event, ownership and upstream coverage. The PCR denominator, stock/fate, allocation and closure methods remain unchanged; foreground records cannot choose a different method. Parent totals are non-exchange diagnostics, never copied to children or summed across unlike units as an exchange; do not duplicate a complete formulation/assembly/actual mixed carrier as constituents. Incomplete actual roster, quantity, identity/support, method or coverage blocks final foreground completion, never zero, implicit nonapplicability or manifest-only disclosure. | cp_material; actual_child_register; parent_ledger_id |
| atomic_consumables | crack_treatment; cp_material | Former consumables is a mandatory non-exchange refinement scope and custody/closure ledger key, not a mixed quantity-bearing inventory card.

| atomic_equipment_share | crack_treatment; cp_assets | Former equipment_share is a mandatory non-exchange refinement scope and custody/closure ledger key, not a mixed quantity-bearing inventory card. Preserve the original scope: Expand each actual injection pump/mixer, compressor, access/protection and ventilation asset into its own matched service share. No physical new machine enters solely because a burden fraction is attributed. Named children cover only the listed conditional objects; every other real independent object remains required in the actual register.

| atomic_product_returns | crack_treatment; cp_material | Former product_returns is a mandatory non-exchange refinement scope and custody/closure ledger key, not a mixed quantity-bearing inventory card. Preserve the original scope: Conditional: expand true outward unused resin A, B, seal, cleaner, fuel and other mass-based materials into separate identity/state/custody exchanges. This is not retained closing stock, internal movement or waste. Match gross input identity and avoid netting before counting return. Named children cover only the listed conditional objects; every other real independent object remains required in the actual register. At this node use the original CP to collect each object's identity/state/medium or receiver, one fixed property/unit, independent quantity/conversion, activation or evidenced absence, source-ledger event, ownership and upstream coverage. The PCR denominator, stock/fate, allocation and closure methods remain unchanged; foreground records cannot choose a different method. Parent totals are non-exchange diagnostics, never copied to children or summed across unlike units as an exchange; do not duplicate a complete formulation/assembly/actual mixed carrier as constituents. Incomplete actual roster, quantity, identity/support, method or coverage blocks final foreground completion, never zero, implicit nonapplicability or manifest-only disclosure. | cp_material; actual_child_register; parent_ledger_id |
| atomic_concrete_debris | crack_treatment; cp_waste | Former concrete_debris is a mandatory non-exchange refinement scope and custody/closure ledger key, not a mixed quantity-bearing inventory card. Preserve the original scope: Conditional: collected debris from actual bounded preparation or minor job-caused remedies; retained host is not entirely demolished. Expand contaminated and clean destination-specific wastes separately. Named children cover only the listed conditional objects; every other real independent object remains required in the actual register. At this node use the original CP to collect each object's identity/state/medium or receiver, one fixed property/unit, independent quantity/conversion, activation or evidenced absence, source-ledger event, ownership and upstream coverage.

Incomplete actual roster, quantity, identity/support, method or coverage blocks final foreground completion, never zero, implicit nonapplicability or manifest-only disclosure. | cp_waste; actual_child_register; parent_ledger_id |
| atomic_epoxy_waste | crack_treatment; cp_waste | Former epoxy_waste is a mandatory non-exchange refinement scope and custody/closure ledger key, not a mixed quantity-bearing inventory card. Preserve the original scope: Conditional: expand actual cured/uncured A/B/mixed resin, seal paste, purge residues, wipes and contaminated filters separately by state/composition and receiver. No single generic hazardous waste factor. Named children cover only the listed conditional objects; every other real independent object remains required in the actual register. At this node use the original CP to collect each object's identity/state/medium or receiver, one fixed property/unit, independent quantity/conversion, activation or evidenced absence, source-ledger event, ownership and upstream coverage. The PCR denominator, stock/fate, allocation and closure methods remain unchanged; foreground records cannot choose a different method. Parent totals are non-exchange diagnostics, never copied to children or summed across unlike units as an exchange; do not duplicate a complete formulation/assembly/actual mixed carrier as constituents. Incomplete actual roster, quantity, identity/support, method or coverage blocks final foreground completion, never zero, implicit nonapplicability or manifest-only disclosure. | cp_waste; actual_child_register; parent_ledger_id |
| atomic_packaging_waste | crack_treatment; cp_waste | Former packaging_waste is a mandatory non-exchange refinement scope and custody/closure ledger key, not a mixed quantity-bearing inventory card. Preserve the original scope: Conditional: expand actual empty containers, packaging materials and discarded ports by material, residual contamination and receiver. Returned reusable packaging is an actual product return only when outward custody is documented. Named children cover only the listed conditional objects; every other real independent object remains required in the actual register. At this node use the original CP to collect each object's identity/state/medium or receiver, one fixed property/unit, independent quantity/conversion, activation or evidenced absence, source-ledger event, ownership and upstream coverage. The PCR denominator, stock/fate, allocation and closure methods remain unchanged; foreground records cannot choose a different method.

| atomic_direct_species | crack_treatment; cp_emissions | Former direct_species is a mandatory non-exchange refinement scope and custody/closure ledger key, not a mixed quantity-bearing inventory card. Preserve the original scope: Conditional: expand each identified measured or evidence-modelled substance and receiving medium, including actual fuel combustion, routine resin/cleaner releases and size-specific uncaptured dust. Incident constituents owned by fluid_release are excluded here; each substance/medium/event has one owner. Source 100% solids is not zero emission proof; no generic VOC/NOx umbrella UUID. Named children cover only the listed conditional objects; every other real independent object remains required in the actual register. At this node use the original CP to collect each object's identity/state/medium or receiver, one fixed property/unit, independent quantity/conversion, activation or evidenced absence, source-ledger event, ownership and upstream coverage. The PCR denominator, stock/fate, allocation and closure methods remain unchanged; foreground records cannot choose a different method. Parent totals are non-exchange diagnostics, never copied to children or summed across unlike units as an exchange; do not duplicate a complete formulation/assembly/actual mixed carrier as constituents. Incomplete actual roster, quantity, identity/support, method or coverage blocks final foreground completion, never zero, implicit nonapplicability or manifest-only disclosure. | cp_emissions; actual_child_register; parent_ledger_id |
| atomic_fluid_release | crack_treatment; cp_emissions | Former fluid_release is a mandatory non-exchange refinement scope and custody/closure ledger key, not a mixed quantity-bearing inventory card. Preserve the original scope: Conditional: expand each actual incident release into identified constituent/substance and receiving-medium elementary exchanges. Whole uncontained fuel, resin, cleaner or contaminated-water mass remains only the physical incident/material/fuel ledger. Derive constituent release from actual measured constituent mass or evidenced whole-fluid mass, actual composition fraction and medium-specific fate; a reported species subset is not total fluid. Each substance/medium/event is owned here once and excluded from direct_species. Named children cover only the listed conditional objects; every other real independent object remains required in the actual register. At this node use the original CP to collect each object's identity/state/medium or receiver, one fixed property/unit, independent quantity/conversion, activation or evidenced absence, source-ledger event, ownership and upstream coverage. The PCR denominator, stock/fate, allocation and closure methods remain unchanged; foreground records cannot choose a different method. Parent totals are non-exchange diagnostics, never copied to children or summed across unlike units as an exchange; do not duplicate a complete formulation/assembly/actual mixed carrier as constituents. Incomplete actual roster, quantity, identity/support, method or coverage blocks final foreground completion, never zero, implicit nonapplicability or manifest-only disclosure. | cp_emissions; actual_child_register; parent_ledger_id |
| atomic_legacy_role_mapping | crack_treatment | Legacy roles are non-exchange stock, activity, fate or closure keys in the original CP. Independent child exchanges carry quantities; atomic_ requirements retain mandatory remaining-roster refinement and finalization blocks. Original raw fields, helpers and native-unit operands retain their responsibilities and reconcile by child identity and compatible unit, never adding parent totals or unlike units. Source-table Applies-to migration: seal_paste => atomic_seal_paste; consumables => consumables_abrasive, consumables_wipe, consumables_filter, consumables_masking, consumables_absorbent, consumables_containment, consumables_repair, atomic_consumables; equipment_share => equipment_share_pump, equipment_share_mixer, equipment_share_compressor, equipment_share_access, equipment_share_protection, equipment_share_ventilation, atomic_equipment_share; product_returns => product_returns_resin_a, product_returns_hardener_b, product_returns_seal, product_returns_cleaner, product_returns_fuel, atomic_product_returns; concrete_debris => concrete_debris_clean, concrete_debris_contaminated, atomic_concrete_debris; epoxy_waste => epoxy_waste_resin_a, epoxy_waste_hardener_b, epoxy_waste_mixed_uncured, epoxy_waste_mixed_cured, epoxy_waste_seal, epoxy_waste_purge, epoxy_waste_wipe, epoxy_waste_filter, atomic_epoxy_waste; packaging_waste => packaging_waste_container, packaging_waste_packaging, packaging_waste_port, atomic_packaging_waste; direct_species => atomic_direct_species; fluid_release => atomic_fluid_release | original_protocols; actual_child_register; parent_ledger_id |
| atomic_child_routing | crack_treatment | The following routes each child to its original role, node, unique unit and method CP. Independently apply that original role measurement, stock, source/fate, rework, share, conversion and normalization method to each actual identity/state child. Retain the original helper/selector role parameter as legacy_parent_role, but supply quantity operands from this child independent records; ROW_UNIT(child_row_id) is the explicit unit below. Reconcile stocks/transfers only within the same identity/state and compatible native unit, grouping different materials, media, states and units separately. Parent totals are non-exchange diagnostics, never copied as child operands or summed across unlike units. Unsupported original-helper applicability or missing actual conversion, denominator or evidence blocks finalization; field records cannot choose a new method. Original role-named formula operands remain ledger names rather than duplicate exchanges. A cross-unit legacy role executes by this mapping and actual child unit instead of inheriting a wrong fixed unit.

Each new child has independent evidence needs for actual quantity, identity/state, measurement/conversion, uncertainty and comparable independent observations. Add its own interval only after review confirms applicability to this independent object; never validate a batch with its own maximum. Original ranges of unchanged semantically compatible atomic objects retain their original status. | independent_child_measurement; independent_range_evidence; implementation_range_audit |
| atomic_paired_quantity_provenance | actual internal child source and recipient transfers | Internal I=F is a reconciliation condition for the same actual material/SKU, state, event, custody boundary and gate, never an assignment formula. Each child retains its own actual dispatch quantity and receipt/custody evidence. The same signed custody measurement may be traceably reused without inventing another weighing. Never copy a family total into each child, overwrite a real receipt or force unknown quantities equal. Preserve discrepancies with original values/units, measurement uncertainty, actual transfer loss, state change and responsible-owner evidence; unresolved differences block completion. Internal quantities remain unnormalized physical amounts, divided by the original reference denominator only at each card final step; parent-role sums are QA only. | source_actual_child_quantity; recipient_actual_child_quantity; signed_custody_measurement_id; source_receipt_provenance; paired_quantity_uncertainty; transfer_discrepancy_record; actual_loss_or_state_change_owner; pair_reconciliation_status |

## 9. Validation Rules

| rule_id | Applies to | Rule | source_ids |
| --- | --- | --- | --- |
| `validate_scope` | crack_treatment | Reject scope crossing to new/major replacement, moving/hydrostatic-pressure cracks, PU waterstop or water/mining tunnels; retained host receives no new lining burden or avoided replacement credit. | un-cpc3-2025; sika-sikadur52-us-2014 |
| `validate_gate` | accepted_crack_repair | Require recorded qualified prestate, actual compatible regional materials/method, surface seal cure before injection, complete actual injection/cure records and owner-sourced verification criteria/results/tolerances with units, defect closure and signed acceptance. Lab strength or elapsed time alone is not acceptance. | sika-sikadur52-us-2014 |
| `validate_length` | accepted_crack_repair | Recompute union of accepted unique paths and L; count each branch once, never tunnel length, ports/faces/passes or unresolved rejects. Confirm every exchange uses same positive accepted-L denominator with all failed/setup/purge work retained once. |  |
| `validate_custody` | all inventory rows | Audit gross net-of-tare receipts before returns, internal movements, outward custody, retained closing stock and burden carry-forward. Verify actual whole-fluid fuel outlets and burn calculation without incident double subtraction; capture/waste/elementary releases remain distinct. |  |
| `validate_assets` | equipment_share_pump; equipment_share_mixer; equipment_share_compressor; equipment_share_access; equipment_share_protection; equipment_share_ventilation; atomic_equipment_share | Verify every shared asset consumer/period, complete-life scope and compatible measured service driver; observed history plus justified future scenario for in-service assets includes replacement/termination/EOL and uncertainty/sensitivity/updates. Missing coverage or denominator blocks finalisation; remove overlapping direct fuel/spare/tool/rental coverage. |  |
| `validate_identity_and_emissions` | all inventory rows | Verify concrete identities/properties/units before final dataset exchange binding; do not substitute near-match resin manufacture/new tunnel/PU for repair service. Check actual species/medium and capture/retention/reaction, fluid partition and weather/host moisture; 100% solids never proves zero release. Record missing ranges, UUIDs and material evidence explicitly. |  |
| `validate_campaign` | crack_treatment | Trace all batches and preparation/injection/cure/verification periods, setup/changeover and rejects to this node and actual rework/waste/product-return destinations. Reject unresolved failures as accepted output; shared-job causal attribution reconciles once across periods. |  |
| close_atomic_seal_paste | crack_treatment; cp_material | Block final foreground completion until every actual object in atomic_seal_paste is reconciled to independent actual child exchanges or evidenced nonactivation. Check one property/unit, independent physical quantity normalized by the original reference denominator, source/fate/period, one burden owner and the original stock/WIP/rework closure. Candidate structural success cannot close this method gate. |  |
| close_atomic_consumables | crack_treatment; cp_material | Block final foreground completion until every actual object in atomic_consumables is reconciled to independent actual child exchanges or evidenced nonactivation. Check one property/unit, independent physical quantity normalized by the original reference denominator, source/fate/period, one burden owner and the original stock/WIP/rework closure. Candidate structural success cannot close this method gate. |  |
| close_atomic_equipment_share | crack_treatment; cp_assets | Block final foreground completion until every actual object in atomic_equipment_share is reconciled to independent actual child exchanges or evidenced nonactivation. Check one property/unit, independent physical quantity normalized by the original reference denominator, source/fate/period, one burden owner and the original stock/WIP/rework closure. Candidate structural success cannot close this method gate. |  |
| close_atomic_product_returns | crack_treatment; cp_material | Block final foreground completion until every actual object in atomic_product_returns is reconciled to independent actual child exchanges or evidenced nonactivation. Check one property/unit, independent physical quantity normalized by the original reference denominator, source/fate/period, one burden owner and the original stock/WIP/rework closure. Candidate structural success cannot close this method gate. |  |
| close_atomic_concrete_debris | crack_treatment; cp_waste | Block final foreground completion until every actual object in atomic_concrete_debris is reconciled to independent actual child exchanges or evidenced nonactivation. Check one property/unit, independent physical quantity normalized by the original reference denominator, source/fate/period, one burden owner and the original stock/WIP/rework closure. Candidate structural success cannot close this method gate. |  |
| close_atomic_epoxy_waste | crack_treatment; cp_waste | Block final foreground completion until every actual object in atomic_epoxy_waste is reconciled to independent actual child exchanges or evidenced nonactivation. Check one property/unit, independent physical quantity normalized by the original reference denominator, source/fate/period, one burden owner and the original stock/WIP/rework closure. Candidate structural success cannot close this method gate. |  |
| close_atomic_packaging_waste | crack_treatment; cp_waste | Block final foreground completion until every actual object in atomic_packaging_waste is reconciled to independent actual child exchanges or evidenced nonactivation. Check one property/unit, independent physical quantity normalized by the original reference denominator, source/fate/period, one burden owner and the original stock/WIP/rework closure. Candidate structural success cannot close this method gate. |  |
| close_atomic_direct_species | crack_treatment; cp_emissions | Block final foreground completion until every actual object in atomic_direct_species is reconciled to independent actual child exchanges or evidenced nonactivation. Check one property/unit, independent physical quantity normalized by the original reference denominator, source/fate/period, one burden owner and the original stock/WIP/rework closure. Candidate structural success cannot close this method gate. |  |
| close_atomic_fluid_release | crack_treatment; cp_emissions | Block final foreground completion until every actual object in atomic_fluid_release is reconciled to independent actual child exchanges or evidenced nonactivation. Check one property/unit, independent physical quantity normalized by the original reference denominator, source/fate/period, one burden owner and the original stock/WIP/rework closure. Candidate structural success cannot close this method gate. |  |
| atomic_pair_provenance_complete | actual internal child source and recipient transfers | Verify actual source/receipt evidence, original physical quantities/units and ownership for the same material/state/event/gate. Traceable reuse of the same signed measurement is allowed; copied parent totals, overwritten receipts and forced unknown equality are prohibited. Unexplained differences without uncertainty, actual loss or state-transition responsibility evidence block completion; verify exactly one normalization per card. |  |
