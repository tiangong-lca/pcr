# Battery-powered herbaceous vegetation construction-site clearance services

## 1. Scope and Applicability

This PCR covers first preconstruction above-ground cutting of grass and nonwoody herbaceous vegetation compatible with the actual approved battery electric handheld grass blade or trimmer, followed by collection and declared residual receiver transfer. The actual site contract, protected limits, utilities/access and erosion-control responsibility must permit this route. The cited roadwork specification supplies boundary distinctions; its broad clearing-and-grubbing scope and numeric stump rules are not grass-cutting requirements.

Exclude recurring landscape mowing, crop harvesting, woody brush/trees, stump/root grubbing, soil stripping/excavation/grading/drainage/blasting, onsite chipping/burning/herbicide, vegetation cultivation, receiver treatment operation and claims of saleable biomass co-production. A proposed beneficial biomass product requires an explicit additional coproduct/boundary review before this method is used for that claim.

## 4. Measurement and Unit Rules

| rule_id | Applies to | Required property | Required unit | Rule |
| --- | --- | --- | --- | --- |
| reference_area | reference product | Area `93a60a56-a3c8-19da-a746-0800200c9a66` | m2 | Use cp_acceptance to establish actual accepted horizontal polygon area. The reference output amount is 1 m2; aggregate lot burdens are attributed to that same area. Retain surveying uncertainty and exclude duplicate rework passes from the denominator. |
| wet_residual_mass | biomass_residual | Mass `93a60a56-a3c8-11da-a746-0800200b9a66` | kg | Measure net wet mass at actual custody transfer; record moisture method/date separately. Do not substitute dry mass or infer a universal area-to-mass conversion. |
| charging_boundary | charging_electricity | Energy | kWh | Retain charger-supply electricity including attributable losses/standby; battery nameplate capacity is not measured electricity. Exact Energy support must be resolved before concrete exchange construction. |
| freight_boundary | freight_services | Freight transport | t*km | Keep actual payload mass and distance separate and preserve provider/empty-return coverage. Exact transport support must be verified for the chosen concrete exchange. |


## 5. System Boundary

### Boundary Abstraction

| Field | Value |
| --- | --- |
| declared_starting_condition | Existing approved construction-site low vegetation; no root/soil removal; access, utility and protected-vegetation interfaces established |
| starting_condition_role | Environmental starting stock and site condition; not purchased crop input and no invented cultivation burden |
| product_classification_scope | Only this narrower clearance service within CPC 54320; no expansion from classification alone |
| recursive_input_rule | An outsourced same-category clearance input carries its upstream service dataset and explicit area/work ids; remove those activities from own foreground records and count accepted polygon once. Do not recurse through site ownership or vegetation stock. |
| upstream_dataset_requirement | Supplier datasets for actual electricity, assets, materials and freight with technology, geography, period and included-burden boundaries; downstream residual treatment coverage declared separately |
| disclosure | Actual cut/collection contract, source vegetation and residual status; work ids and rejected areas; assets/consumers/periods; supplier coverage; protection maintenance/termination ownership; gaps and uncertainty |

### Boundary Rules

| rule_id | Applies to | Rule | source_ids |
| --- | --- | --- | --- |
| `scope_eligibility` | foreground_system_boundary | This PCR covers first preconstruction above-ground cutting of grass and nonwoody herbaceous vegetation compatible with the actual approved battery electric handheld grass blade or trimmer, followed by collection and declared residual receiver transfer. The actual site contract, protected limits, utilities/access and erosion-control responsibility must permit this route. The cited roadwork specification supplies boundary distinctions; its broad clearing-and-grubbing scope and numeric stump rules are not grass-cutting requirements. Exclude recurring landscape mowing, crop harvesting, woody brush/trees, stump/root grubbing, soil stripping/excavation/grading/drainage/blasting, onsite chipping/burning/herbicide, vegetation cultivation, receiver treatment operation and claims of saleable biomass co-production. A proposed beneficial biomass product requires an explicit additional coproduct/boundary review before this method is used for that claim. |  |
| limits_gate | clearance | Start only inside approved clearing limits with actual vegetation protection and erosion/access/utility responsibility recorded; remedy clearance-caused damage with its actual burdens. The clearance gate cannot certify completion of all erosion controls. | fhwa-fp24-201 |
| cut_collect_gate | clearance | Keep cutting and collection within one independent source-removal responsibility ending in accepted polygon and residual custody transfer. Later grubbing, earthwork and receiver treatment have distinct boundaries. | fhwa-fp24-201; husqvarna-520irx-2024 |
| complete_assets | clearance | Include actual charging, cutter/battery/charger/tools, logistics, materials, rejected work and protection maintenance/removal attributable to the complete clearance cycle. Record every asset consumer and service period, including other jobs; supplier coverage prevents duplicate burdens. Enumerate manufacture/provision, each use/maintenance/replacement reporting period and terminal-treatment phase. Link every asset input/event to its actual period and the lot output to its clearance acceptance period; missing replacement/termination responsibility blocks final burden finalization. |  |
| no_crop_credit | clearance | Existing vegetation carries no invented cultivation inputs, avoided-production credit, sequestration claim or saleable coproduct assumption. Report actual wet residual status; proposed useful-product claims require separate review. |  |

## 7. Allocation and Co-product Handling

| rule_id | Applies to | Rule | source_ids |
| --- | --- | --- | --- |
| service_burden | clearance | Attribute all actual first-cycle burdens, including failed cut height, incomplete collection, damage repair and recutting, to accepted service. Unaccepted areas are tracked as work-in-progress/rejects and never included in the accepted denominator; unresolved defects block their output. |  |
| residual_status | biomass_residual | Cut vegetation is residual, with measured custody and actual destination. Do not allocate a coproduct credit or substitute fuel/feed/fertilizer by assumption. A useful-product claim requires separate explicit review. |  |
| asset_sharing | `reusable_asset_provision_cutter`; `reusable_asset_provision_separate_battery`; `reusable_asset_provision_separate_charger`; `reusable_asset_provision_reusable_blade` | For each cutter, battery, charger, collection tool and reusable protection asset, record manufacture, maintenance, replacement and end-of-life boundary and evidenced complete-life service. Allocate actual lot usage among cutting, collection and rework and all other consumer jobs/periods with one ledger owner; preserve unused future burden and quantify uncertainty. For each asset retain manufacture/provision, use/maintenance/replacement periods, terminal treatment and all consumer-job links in one phase/period ledger. Apply evidenced life-service shares to each period-specific burden and this clearance output; carry unconsumed future burden forward, disclose replacement/termination assumptions and uncertainty, and block finalization if their ownership is unknown. No arbitrary fixed life or equal job split. Supplier rental provision and separate asset production cannot cover the same burden twice. |  |
| stock_returns | `cutting_consumables_line`; `cutting_consumables_replacement_blade`; `protection_consumables_collection_bag`; `unused_material_returns_line`; `unused_material_returns_replacement_blade`; `unused_material_returns_collection_bag`; `other_residuals_line`; `other_residuals_blade` | Reconcile gross opening stock plus receipts with consumption, real outward returns, waste and retained closing stock by material and custody. Retained stock carries declared future burden and is no output. Use gross actual lot-attributable boundary input, with real outward unused-product returns recorded gross and carrying only their traceable matching input burden. Do not net a return out of the input. Retained closing stock is a nonexchange balance with carried-forward burden, allocated outside this completed service; reconcile gross inputs, current use/waste, returns and closing stock without creating a stock output. |  |


## 8. Foreground Data Collection, Calculation, and Quality Rules

### Data Collection Protocols

| protocol_id | process_id | flow_role | record_type | raw_fields | collection_method | unit | frequency | temporal_coverage | site_scope | aggregation_rule | quality_evidence |
| --- | --- | --- | --- | --- | --- | --- | --- | --- | --- | --- | --- |
| cp_acceptance | clearance | accepted service | survey and signed handover | lot_id; polygon_id; approved_boundary; exclusions; retained_islands; accepted_area_m2; survey_uncertainty; vegetation_species; density; moisture; slope; attachment; cut_height_spec; collection_state; defect_id; receiver_ticket; acceptance_time | Survey actual horizontal cleared polygon with traceable coordinate method; overlay approved limits, plan exclusions and retained islands. Retain actual quality specification, before/after evidence, rework pass ids and signed accepted subareas. Use same accepted area for each burden allocation; carry unaccepted area separately. | m2 | each accepted polygon and correction | complete initial clearance through custody closure | actual approved site polygon | per reference flow | Survey calibration/coordinate reference, polygon union without overlap, acceptance authority and closed-defect records |
| cp_energy | clearance | charging_electricity | meter and charging ledger | lot_id; charger_id; meter_id; start_kwh; end_kwh; charge_time; standby_kwh; battery_id; consumer_job; accepted_area_m2 | Meter charger-supply electricity by event; allocate shared charging to identified battery/lot with actual energy evidence. Include attributable charge losses, standby and rework; reconcile meter total across jobs and divide attributed lot energy by accepted area from cp_acceptance. | kWh | each charge and lot closure | all actual charging for first cycle | site or offsite charger tied to lot | per reference flow | Meter accuracy, provider/geography/date and reconciliation; no capacity-only inference |
| cp_assets | clearance | `reusable_asset_provision_cutter`; `reusable_asset_provision_separate_battery`; `reusable_asset_provision_separate_charger`; `reusable_asset_provision_reusable_blade` | asset life-service ledger | asset_id; manufacturer; model; production_boundary; provision_count; manufacture_period; use_period; maintenance_period; replacement_period; terminal_period; maintenance; replacement; terminal_treatment; service_life_basis; usage_lot; consumer_job; period; accepted_area_m2; concrete_exchange_id; physical_event_id; actual_identity_id; actual_state; receiver_or_provider_gate; native_quantity; native_unit; unique_property; measurement_method_id; uncertainty; job_driver; full_life_driver; driver_unit; all_consumer_ids; all_consumer_period_ids; observed_life_driver; evidenced_remaining_driver; complete_asset_packet_id; included_battery_or_charger; measurement_uncertainty | Record each concrete asset separately. Document complete-life provision and maintenance/end-of-life responsibilities, observed usage on cutting/collection/rework and all other jobs/periods. Attribute each asset burden using evidenced consumed service share and normalize lot share by accepted area; retain unconsumed future balance and uncertainty. Record each actual child/refined exchange independently by identity, physical event, state, gate and period. Retain all original obligations even where a corresponding exchange identity is not yet known. Do not allocate a family total or copy its numerical Range to children, count a carrier and its contained material twice, or turn missing occurrence/quantity/native reference into zero. Each concrete exchange has one property and one unit; other CP readings are auxiliary and require evidenced conversion. Missing required refinement blocks dataset completion. For each exact serial complete-life packet, use compatible actual job_driver and full_life_driver across every consumer/period, with observed history and evidenced remainder. The final asset Count fraction is divided by accepted_area_m2 once. Record cutter packet battery/charger/blade inclusions; separate components only outside that packet. Missing complete denominator/termination ownership blocks completion. | Item(s) | each use plus maintenance/retirement update | manufacture/provision; each use/maintenance/replacement reporting period; terminal treatment; actual clearance acceptance cycle | all consumers of each asset | per reference flow | Asset ids, meter/hour/cycle evidence as driver without inventing Duration UUID; rental included coverage and sum of shares/burdens reconciled |
| cp_material | clearance | materials returns and other waste | custody stock and scales | lot_id; material_id; supplier_coverage; opening_stock; gross_receipts; gross_issues; consumed_mass; outward_return; closing_stock; waste_mass; tare; receiver; uncertainty; accepted_area_m2; concrete_exchange_id; physical_event_id; actual_identity_id; actual_state; receiver_or_provider_gate; native_quantity; native_unit; unique_property; measurement_method_id | Weigh and reconcile each actual material from gross receipt/issue through consumption, return, closing stock and waste. Track consumables, protection, bags and packaging separately; link outward custody tickets and one burden owner. Record gross actual lot-attributable material boundary input without netting outward returns. Match each real gross return output to its input identity and traceable burden; retain closing stock as a nonexchange balance with burden carried to future work. Attribute current-service consumed and waste responsibility without double credit, and divide each current lot exchange by accepted area. Record each actual child/refined exchange independently by identity, physical event, state, gate and period. Retain all original obligations even where a corresponding exchange identity is not yet known. Do not allocate a family total or copy its numerical Range to children, count a carrier and its contained material twice, or turn missing occurrence/quantity/native reference into zero. Each concrete exchange has one property and one unit; other CP readings are auxiliary and require evidenced conversion. Missing required refinement blocks dataset completion. | kg | each custody/issue event and lot closure | complete cycle including protection maintenance/termination | lot and real supplier/receiver interfaces | per reference flow | Calibrated scale/tare, documented stock adjustment, signed return/waste tickets and no duplicate provider coverage |
| cp_logistics | clearance | freight_services | actual trip and provider record | trip_id; lot_id; provider; vehicle; payload_kg; route_km; origin; destination; empty_return; shared_load; included_fuel; accepted_area_m2 | Collect actual payload and distance per leg; use tonne-kilometres for each actual loaded movement with traceable kg-to-tonne conversion. Document empty-return and shared-load attribution from provider operation, assign one owner and avoid duplicate provider fuel/capital burdens; divide lot-attributed service by accepted area. | t*km | each trip leg | all equipment/material/residual transport for cycle | actual origin-site-receiver routes | per reference flow | Payload/route tickets, coverage of empty returns, allocation evidence and exact future transport support verification |
| cp_residual | clearance | biomass_residual | weighing moisture and custody | lot_id; transfer_id; wet_gross_kg; container_tare_kg; wet_net_kg; moisture_method; moisture_date; contaminant; staging_opening; staging_closing; receiver; product_or_waste_status; accepted_area_m2 | Weigh net wet biomass dispatched to actual declared receiver and collect representative moisture evidence. Reconcile all collections and staging balances to custody tickets, including recut material and any residual left on site contrary to specification; receiver rejection returns to clearance responsibility until resolved. Divide attributable net transfer by accepted area. | kg | each load and lot closure | cutting through accepted receiver custody | site staging and actual receiver gate | per reference flow | Scale/tare, moisture sampling coverage, signed status/custody, mass-balance uncertainty and rejection closure |
| cp_releases | clearance | actual exchanges required by `refine_characterized_releases` | substance monitoring or applicable method | lot_id; substance; particle_size; medium; measured_mass; detection_limit; method; applicability; uncertainty; accepted_area_m2; concrete_exchange_id; physical_event_id; actual_identity_id; actual_state; receiver_or_provider_gate; native_quantity; native_unit; unique_property; measurement_method_id | Identify actual substance and receiving medium before exchange selection; retain monitoring coverage, detection limits or reviewed applicable factor activity and uncertainty. Separate waste from environmental release, include all repeated work and normalize attributable substance mass by accepted area; do not invent combustion emissions. Record each actual child/refined exchange independently by identity, physical event, state, gate and period. Retain all original obligations even where a corresponding exchange identity is not yet known. Do not allocate a family total or copy its numerical Range to children, count a carrier and its contained material twice, or turn missing occurrence/quantity/native reference into zero. Each concrete exchange has one property and one unit; other CP readings are auxiliary and require evidenced conversion. Missing required refinement blocks dataset completion. | kg | each monitored event or reviewed assessment | whole first cycle | actual release location and medium | per reference flow | Traceable substance/species characterization, factor applicability and reported unmeasured coverage gaps |
| cp_remedy | clearance | damage_remedy_service | incident remedy provider and acceptance | lot_id; incident_id; provider; remedy_scope; job_count; included_materials; included_energy; included_assets; included_transport; acceptance_date; accepted_area_m2 | Record each actual clearance-caused damage incident and accepted remedy job with provider primary inventory and included services/materials. Attribute to the causing lot regardless of later remedy date; link period and accepted remedy evidence. Reconcile with directly recorded protection materials, charging, assets and freight to remove overlaps; divide actual job burden by accepted clearance area. | Item(s) | each incident and signed remedy closure | causing clearance period through actual remedy completion | actual affected vegetation/site interface and provider | per reference flow | No-damage inspection or complete incident/remedy ledger; provider coverage and closed acceptance without duplicate direct input |

### Calculation Rules

| rule_id | Applies to | Formula or rule | Inputs | Output | source_ids |
| --- | --- | --- | --- | --- | --- |
| area_attribution | all inventory rows | Attribute each measured complete-lot exchange to its owning clearance lot and divide by the same accepted horizontal polygon area from cp_acceptance; retain original numerator unit. Accepted output remains 1 m2. Rework adds burden and never adds denominator area. | cp_acceptance; node-specific collection protocol | inventory per 1 m2 accepted service |  |
| stock_reconcile | `cutting_consumables_line`; `cutting_consumables_replacement_blade`; `protection_consumables_collection_bag`; `unused_material_returns_line`; `unused_material_returns_replacement_blade`; `unused_material_returns_collection_bag`; `other_residuals_line`; `other_residuals_blade` | For each material and custody scope reconcile opening stock plus gross receipts against consumption plus real outward returns plus closing stock plus waste; document any overlap between measured consumption and downstream waste before applying the balance. Gross issues are an internal ledger, not a second boundary input. Use gross boundary receipts/opening-stock issues as input and genuine gross outward return as product output without input netting; closing stock remains a nonexchange balance and its burden is carried forward. | cp_material | reconciled quantity and carried-forward stock burden |  |

### Data Quality Requirements

| requirement_id | Applies to | Requirement | Evidence |
| --- | --- | --- | --- |
| identity_gate | all rows | Verify concrete identity, state, provider, flow type, property/unit and destination from actual records before final TIDAS exchange binding. Umbrellas instantiate zero or multiple specific exchanges; unknown identities and support remain explicit gaps. | Supplier data, identity detail and property/unit-group evidence |
| same_lot_basis | all rows | Keep polygon, date, actual vegetation and work ids identical across numerator and denominator; rejected area and later maintenance remain separately recorded. Report survey/meter/weighing and allocation uncertainty and missing coverage. | cp_acceptance and complete node ledgers |
| custody_quality | biomass_residual; `other_residuals_line`; `other_residuals_blade` | Document actual receiver status and downstream treatment responsibility. No estimated wet-to-dry/area-to-mass factor or unverified product-versus-waste claim. Resolve receiver rejection and remaining onsite residual before acceptance. | cp_residual; cp_material |
| source_limits | clearance | Confirm actual project contract and current applicable equipment instructions; neither FHWA roadwork scope nor manufacturer example supplies universal cut height, productivity, emission or wear factors. | fhwa-fp24-201; fhwa-fp24-errata-20260915; husqvarna-520irx-2024 |
| `refine_reusable_asset_provision` | `reusable_asset_provision_cutter`; `reusable_asset_provision_separate_battery`; `reusable_asset_provision_separate_charger`; `reusable_asset_provision_reusable_blade` | Preserve this actual collection and closure scope as a mandatory dataset-production requirement: Instantiate a separate concrete exchange for each asset and model production, maintenance and terminal treatment across its complete evidenced service life. This umbrella does not merge heterogeneous equipment into one item. Range evidence need: Need asset-specific lifetime service, replacement/repair records and allocation uncertainty; no default life or battery-cycle count. Independently establish every actual identity, state, real provider/receiver and exactly one exchange property/unit before constructing its flow card. Each actual exchange requires its own recorded quantity and applicable method, uncertainty and custody/fate coverage. Auxiliary CP units do not authorize extra exchange views. Actual occurrence unknown is not zero; never invent a material/species/provider list or split a parent total. Quantitative screening evidence must fit each actual exchange; a former family interval cannot be copied or divided into child ranges. Further actual identities not fully specified by the conditional children require mandatory refinement and prevent dataset completion; this requirement is not itself a flow exchange. Actual collection-tool and reusable-protection asset functions/models and other native service references require concrete full-life identity/property/unit, all consumers/periods and replacement/termination ownership. | `cp_assets`; actual independent records and identity/unit evidence |
| `refine_cutting_consumables` | `cutting_consumables_line`; `cutting_consumables_replacement_blade` | Preserve this actual collection and closure scope as a mandatory dataset-production requirement: Instantiate documented line, blade replacement or sharpening consumables and dry cleanup materials separately. Intact reusable blade belongs in asset provision; never invent line use for a blade route. Range evidence need: Need actual material identity, issue/use/wear measurements and uncertainty; no general blade wear or line-loss percentage. Independently establish every actual identity, state, real provider/receiver and exactly one exchange property/unit before constructing its flow card. Each actual exchange requires its own recorded quantity and applicable method, uncertainty and custody/fate coverage. Auxiliary CP units do not authorize extra exchange views. Actual occurrence unknown is not zero; never invent a material/species/provider list or split a parent total. Quantitative screening evidence must fit each actual exchange; a former family interval cannot be copied or divided into child ranges. Further actual identities not fully specified by the conditional children require mandatory refinement and prevent dataset completion; this requirement is not itself a flow exchange. Actual sharpening products and dry-cleanup material identities/functions require independent exact records; no universal attachment coefficient or wear-to-air inference. | `cp_material`; actual independent records and identity/unit evidence |
| `refine_protection_consumables` | `protection_consumables_collection_bag` | Preserve this actual collection and closure scope as a mandatory dataset-production requirement: Include actual temporary protection, collection bags and protective/cleanup consumables attributable to clearance, including maintenance and removal responsibilities. Actual clearance-caused damage-remedy materials are included here when measured directly; provider-included material is covered by damage_remedy_service and must not be duplicated. Long-lived protection is an asset, and supplier-included materials receive no second upstream burden. Range evidence need: Need project-specific protected-boundary plan, material quantities, reuse/termination evidence and uncertainty; no standard kg per m2. Independently establish every actual identity, state, real provider/receiver and exactly one exchange property/unit before constructing its flow card. Each actual exchange requires its own recorded quantity and applicable method, uncertainty and custody/fate coverage. Auxiliary CP units do not authorize extra exchange views. Actual occurrence unknown is not zero; never invent a material/species/provider list or split a parent total. Quantitative screening evidence must fit each actual exchange; a former family interval cannot be copied or divided into child ranges. Further actual identities not fully specified by the conditional children require mandatory refinement and prevent dataset completion; this requirement is not itself a flow exchange. Actual temporary-protection, other cleanup/disposable and directly modelled damage-remedy product functions/SKUs require independent identities/units and maintenance/removal responsibilities. Long-lived protection asset-owned; remedy provider included materials not direct supply again. | `cp_material`; actual independent records and identity/unit evidence |
| `refine_unused_material_returns` | `unused_material_returns_line`; `unused_material_returns_replacement_blade`; `unused_material_returns_collection_bag` | Preserve this actual collection and closure scope as a mandatory dataset-production requirement: Instantiate only real supplier or owner return transfers of unused consumables with matching inbound identity and burden. Retained site stock remains a balance, never an outward product exchange. Range evidence need: Need traceable gross issue/receipt and signed outward return weights; no assumed return fraction. Independently establish every actual identity, state, real provider/receiver and exactly one exchange property/unit before constructing its flow card. Each actual exchange requires its own recorded quantity and applicable method, uncertainty and custody/fate coverage. Auxiliary CP units do not authorize extra exchange views. Actual occurrence unknown is not zero; never invent a material/species/provider list or split a parent total. Quantitative screening evidence must fit each actual exchange; a former family interval cannot be copied or divided into child ranges. Further actual identities not fully specified by the conditional children require mandatory refinement and prevent dataset completion; this requirement is not itself a flow exchange. Other actual unused consumable products require original SKU/native unit/recipient and linked supply burden; retained stock not outward exit. | `cp_material`; actual independent records and identity/unit evidence |
| `refine_other_residuals` | `other_residuals_line`; `other_residuals_blade` | Preserve this actual collection and closure scope as a mandatory dataset-production requirement: Separate each actual waste by material, hazardous status and receiving route; keep rejected attachment and packaging distinct from vegetation. Asset end-of-life already included in asset provision is not counted again here. Range evidence need: Need material-specific weighed waste and receiver evidence; do not assign blanket packaging or reject rate. Independently establish every actual identity, state, real provider/receiver and exactly one exchange property/unit before constructing its flow card. Each actual exchange requires its own recorded quantity and applicable method, uncertainty and custody/fate coverage. Auxiliary CP units do not authorize extra exchange views. Actual occurrence unknown is not zero; never invent a material/species/provider list or split a parent total. Quantitative screening evidence must fit each actual exchange; a former family interval cannot be copied or divided into child ranges. Further actual identities not fully specified by the conditional children require mandatory refinement and prevent dataset completion; this requirement is not itself a flow exchange. Actual packaging, contaminated collection bags, cleanup articles and other waste material/hazard/receiver streams need actual roster; keep vegetation separately and unknown wear as gap, not air. | `cp_material`; actual independent records and identity/unit evidence |
| `refine_characterized_releases` | actual independently refined exchanges | Preserve this actual collection and closure scope as a mandatory dataset-production requirement: Create concrete exchanges only for measured or justified characterized substances, particle size where relevant and actual receiving medium. No direct cutter combustion, methane, aggregate VOC or generic dust is presumed from an electric route; unmeasured material wear remains a quantified data gap rather than automatic air emission. Range evidence need: Need actual substance/species, medium, monitoring or reviewed factor and uncertainty; no source-backed generic emission range established. Independently establish every actual identity, state, real provider/receiver and exactly one exchange property/unit before constructing its flow card. Each actual exchange requires its own recorded quantity and applicable method, uncertainty and custody/fate coverage. Auxiliary CP units do not authorize extra exchange views. Actual occurrence unknown is not zero; never invent a material/species/provider list or split a parent total. Quantitative screening evidence must fit each actual exchange; a former family interval cannot be copied or divided into child ranges. Further actual identities not fully specified by the conditional children require mandatory refinement and prevent dataset completion; this requirement is not itself a flow exchange. Actual substance, disjoint particle-size fraction and air/water/soil receiving compartment; matched measurement or species/activity factor, whole-fluid composition/fate audit, capture and uncertainty; unknown is not zero. | `cp_releases`; actual independent records and identity/unit evidence |
| `atomic_exchange_identity_unit` | all inventory rows | Each concrete flow card identifies exactly one actual independently supplied product/SKU/formulation, complete assembly, complete single-function or genuine complete bounded provider service, actual waste composite/state/receiver, or substance/size/receiving medium, with exactly one property and unit. Different actual identities require independent quantities and records, not a summed family exchange. A complete product/carrier includes its contents once. Same unchanged SKU/state usable supply/return pairs and matched physical internal send/receive pairs use the same selected property/unit; kg and count or MJ and kWh auxiliaries are nonadditive measurements, never duplicate exchanges. Missing identity/occurrence/quantity/native reference is a gap, not zero. Any pooled denominator retains original configuration strata, accepted state/gate and actual causal attribution; no unlike jobs/branches/routes treated as equivalent. | actual identity, unit, custody and independent quantity evidence |
| `asset_final_normalization_once` | all inventory rows | An asset-equivalent formula already ending in division by N, D or A is the final quantity per reference flow. Its complete-life fraction and accepted-output normalization constitute the same normalization operation as the general normalization rule; never divide it by that denominator again. Apply the complete-life upstream burden exactly once. Actual complete provider event counts remain event quantities, not owned-asset fractions. | actual identity, unit, custody and independent quantity evidence |


## 9. Validation Rules

| rule_id | Applies to | Rule | source_ids |
| --- | --- | --- | --- |
| accepted_gate_check | accepted_clearance | Require approved compatible route, specified cut/collection state, closed damage/recut defects, declared residual custody and signed accepted polygon; reject woody/grubbing/earthwork or useful-biomass claims outside this scope. | fhwa-fp24-201; husqvarna-520irx-2024 |
| area_check | all rows | Confirm 1 m2 reference output and same accepted horizontal polygon denominator; no duplicate overlap, retained-island substitution or rework pass area. Missing accepted area/quality makes the lot incomplete. |  |
| material_custody_check | all rows | Reconcile stocks, real returns, waste and biomass receiver tickets with uncertainty; retained stock cannot be an exported product and gross-net return conventions cannot both credit the same quantity. |  |
| asset_coverage_check | `reusable_asset_provision_cutter`; `reusable_asset_provision_separate_battery`; `reusable_asset_provision_separate_charger`; `reusable_asset_provision_reusable_blade`; charging_electricity; freight_services | Require asset consumers/periods and complete production/maintenance/end-of-life responsibility, electricity supply meter and actual freight/provider boundary. Check shares and included burdens once; no invented life, capacity-derived charging or default transport factors. Check manufacture/use/maintenance/replacement/termination period links and period-specific shares; unresolved replacement or termination ownership blocks final burden finalization. |  |
| identity_release_check | all rows | Before exchange construction verify each actual UUID and support, resolve actual product-versus-waste/substance-medium status, and report remaining Range/identity/support evidence gaps. No near-match reference service, crop harvest or unspecified electricity identity is acceptable. |  |
| `atomization_reusable_asset_provision_complete` | `reusable_asset_provision_cutter`; `reusable_asset_provision_separate_battery`; `reusable_asset_provision_separate_charger`; `reusable_asset_provision_reusable_blade` | Require independent actual quantity, identity/state/gate and one property/unit for each applicable exchange in this scope; preserve full original protocol, normalization, stock, returns, waste/releases and shared-resource ownership. Reject completion on an unknown required child, unsupported native reference or missing quantity; evidenced nonoccurrence is separate from missing data. No family-total allocation, copied family Range or duplicate carrier/constituent/bundled-part exchange. Completion requires satisfying `refine_reusable_asset_provision` with actual records; unresolved required expansion blocks the dataset. | `husqvarna-520irx-2024` |
| `atomization_cutting_consumables_complete` | `cutting_consumables_line`; `cutting_consumables_replacement_blade` | Require independent actual quantity, identity/state/gate and one property/unit for each applicable exchange in this scope; preserve full original protocol, normalization, stock, returns, waste/releases and shared-resource ownership. Reject completion on an unknown required child, unsupported native reference or missing quantity; evidenced nonoccurrence is separate from missing data. No family-total allocation, copied family Range or duplicate carrier/constituent/bundled-part exchange. Completion requires satisfying `refine_cutting_consumables` with actual records; unresolved required expansion blocks the dataset. | `husqvarna-520irx-2024` |
| `atomization_protection_consumables_complete` | `protection_consumables_collection_bag` | Require independent actual quantity, identity/state/gate and one property/unit for each applicable exchange in this scope; preserve full original protocol, normalization, stock, returns, waste/releases and shared-resource ownership. Reject completion on an unknown required child, unsupported native reference or missing quantity; evidenced nonoccurrence is separate from missing data. No family-total allocation, copied family Range or duplicate carrier/constituent/bundled-part exchange. Completion requires satisfying `refine_protection_consumables` with actual records; unresolved required expansion blocks the dataset. | `fhwa-fp24-201` |

Reject completion on an unknown required child, unsupported native reference or missing quantity; evidenced nonoccurrence is separate from missing data. No family-total allocation, copied family Range or duplicate carrier/constituent/bundled-part exchange. Completion requires satisfying `refine_unused_material_returns` with actual records; unresolved required expansion blocks the dataset. |  |
| `atomization_other_residuals_complete` | `other_residuals_line`; `other_residuals_blade` | Require independent actual quantity, identity/state/gate and one property/unit for each applicable exchange in this scope; preserve full original protocol, normalization, stock, returns, waste/releases and shared-resource ownership. Reject completion on an unknown required child, unsupported native reference or missing quantity; evidenced nonoccurrence is separate from missing data. No family-total allocation, copied family Range or duplicate carrier/constituent/bundled-part exchange. Completion requires satisfying `refine_other_residuals` with actual records; unresolved required expansion blocks the dataset. | `husqvarna-520irx-2024` |
| `atomization_characterized_releases_complete` | actual independently refined exchanges | Require independent actual quantity, identity/state/gate and one property/unit for each applicable exchange in this scope; preserve full original protocol, normalization, stock, returns, waste/releases and shared-resource ownership. Reject completion on an unknown required child, unsupported native reference or missing quantity; evidenced nonoccurrence is separate from missing data. No family-total allocation, copied family Range or duplicate carrier/constituent/bundled-part exchange. Completion requires satisfying `refine_characterized_releases` with actual records; unresolved required expansion blocks the dataset. |  |
| `validate_atomic_exchange_unit_and_normalization` | all inventory rows | Each concrete flow card identifies exactly one actual independently supplied product/SKU/formulation, complete assembly, complete single-function or genuine complete bounded provider service, actual waste composite/state/receiver, or substance/size/receiving medium, with exactly one property and unit. Different actual identities require independent quantities and records, not a summed family exchange. A complete product/carrier includes its contents once. Same unchanged SKU/state usable supply/return pairs and matched physical internal send/receive pairs use the same selected property/unit; kg and count or MJ and kWh auxiliaries are nonadditive measurements, never duplicate exchanges. Missing identity/occurrence/quantity/native reference is a gap, not zero. An asset-equivalent formula already ending in division by N, D or A is the final quantity per reference flow. Its complete-life fraction and accepted-output normalization constitute the same normalization operation as the general normalization rule; never divide it by that denominator again. Apply the complete-life upstream burden exactly once. Actual complete provider event counts remain event quantities, not owned-asset fractions. |  |
