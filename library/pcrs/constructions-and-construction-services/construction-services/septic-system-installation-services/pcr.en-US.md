# Gravity-fed prefabricated polyethylene septic-tank installation services

## 1. Scope and Applicability

This PCR covers first installation of a factory-made polyethylene gravity septic tank in a nontraffic location with demonstrated dry, non-buoyant site conditions. The accountable job includes utility clearance, actual excavation and level support preparation, vessel inspection/lowering, compatible inlet/outlet short stubs and sealing/tee connections, required access risers/lids, suitable backfill and compaction, surface drainage grading and erosion-resistant finish, and the actual specified installation-stage inspection/test. The gate is an accepted installed vessel bounded by explicitly located inlet and outlet stub endpoints. A tank by itself does not deliver a functioning complete septic treatment/dispersal system.

Exclude onsite tank manufacture, traffic-load or high-groundwater anchorage routes, pumps/dosing/aeration/disinfection units, drainfields, building drains, ongoing wastewater treatment, pumping-out and later maintenance. Actual permit/design and model-specific approved instructions determine compliance; the cited manufacturer example establishes route responsibilities rather than universal dimensions or test settings. If the site needs excluded buoyancy or drainage-control works, route fit must be reassessed before applying this PCR.

## 4. Measurement and Unit Rules

| rule_id | Applies to | Required property | Required unit | Rule |
| --- | --- | --- | --- | --- |
| counted_handover | accepted_tank_installation | Number of items `01846770-4cfe-4a25-8ad9-919d8d378345` | Item(s) | One accepted installation is counted only after its complete stated civil/connection gate passes; capacity is a design qualifier and cannot convert different tank models into equivalent counts. |
| physical_measurements | all inventory rows | Actual exchange property | Actual recorded unit | Retain each quantity in its physically measured unit: mass, energy, service duration, transport work or actual equipment service unit. Verify each property-to-unitgroup chain for final binding. Record actual density/moisture and calibrated measurement if converting soil or water volume to mass; never infer mass from tank capacity or replace time/energy with count. |


## 5. System Boundary

### Boundary Abstraction

| Field | Value |
| --- | --- |
| declared_starting_condition | An approved qualified nontraffic site and an upstream factory tank at its declared supply gate. In-situ native soil is environmental starting stock; job-specific excavation, soil handling, support and reinstatement are foreground responsibilities. |
| starting_condition_role | Declared site condition and upstream purchased-product gate; neither zero-burden new excavation nor a complete operating septic installation |
| product_classification_scope | Semantic tank-installation subset of CPC3.0 54342, with inlet/outlet stub limits |
| recursive_input_rule | Do not recursively consume this same accepted final service for the same job. An independently supplied excavation/support service is a distinct bounded provider input only when its real work, quantities, responsibility and acceptance handoff exist; otherwise its operations stay inside tank_installation. |
| upstream_dataset_requirement | Factory tank and actual separate materials require cradle-to-supply datasets. Machinery/provider coverage must state production, use/maintenance and removal coverage and fill real gaps once; delivery/packaging included upstream must not be added twice. |
| disclosure | Declare actual scope owner, supply-kit bill, soil custody, field methods, all site work, installation acceptance, failures/retests, stock carry-forward and machinery service-period attribution. Future wastewater operation and downstream drains remain separately owned. |

### Boundary Rules

| --- | --- | --- | --- |
| `scope_eligibility` | foreground_system_boundary | This PCR covers first installation of a factory-made polyethylene gravity septic tank in a nontraffic location with demonstrated dry, non-buoyant site conditions. The accountable job includes utility clearance, actual excavation and level support preparation, vessel inspection/lowering, compatible inlet/outlet short stubs and sealing/tee connections, required access risers/lids, suitable backfill and compaction, surface drainage grading and erosion-resistant finish, and the actual specified installation-stage inspection/test. The gate is an accepted installed vessel bounded by explicitly located inlet and outlet stub endpoints. A tank by itself does not deliver a functioning complete septic treatment/dispersal system. Exclude onsite tank manufacture, traffic-load or high-groundwater anchorage routes, pumps/dosing/aeration/disinfection units, drainfields, building drains, ongoing wastewater treatment, pumping-out and later maintenance. Actual permit/design and model-specific approved instructions determine compliance; the cited manufacturer example establishes route responsibilities rather than universal dimensions or test settings. If the site needs excluded buoyancy or drainage-control works, route fit must be reassessed before applying this PCR. |  |
| site_fit | tank_installation | Require approved actual utilities/soil/groundwater/nontraffic assessment. Include excavation and level compacted support. Unsuitable soil removal and suitable replacement are measured. Reject route use when excluded buoyancy/traffic works are actually necessary. | `ads-septic-tank-installation-2024` |
| complete_assembly | tank_installation | Reconcile factory bill of supply against vessel, gaskets, compatible stubs/tees, screws, lids and risers; record only genuine additional components separately. Lower undamaged tank, connect per actual permitted arrangement, support haunches, alternate sidewall backfill before top cover, compact and finish with drainage grading and erosion-resistant vegetation. | `ads-septic-tank-installation-2024` |
| water_and_tests | tank_installation | Require only actual manufacturer/jurisdiction installation inspection/test obligations with recorded units and limits. The source does not require universal pre-backfill water filling; protective filling applies to an excavation at risk of filling with rain/other water. Record actual protection/test water and destination. Oregon riser test figures and vacuum warnings are not universal defaults. | `ads-septic-tank-installation-2024` |
| period_assets | tank_installation | Index job phases preparation, lowering/connections, backfill/finish, inspection, repair/retest and handover. Link each shared excavator/compactor/tool asset to all consuming jobs and reporting periods, including production, service/maintenance/replacement and termination. Actual bounded provider coverage or evidence-based complete-life asset attribution must include capital and removal burdens without duplicating fuel/materials. |  |
| soil_custody | tank_installation | Track excavated native soil, onsite reused backfill, imported fill, closing stock and actual export by source/destination and actual product or waste status. Onsite transfer is a balance, not a new purchased soil input or co-product credit. Waste handoffs and characterized direct releases remain distinct. |  |


## 6. Process Inventory Structure

### Process Map

| process_id | process_name | inclusion | inclusion_condition | role | quantitative_reference |
| --- | --- | --- | --- | --- | --- |
| tank_installation | Civil preparation, tank integration and installation acceptance | required | All in-scope jobs; protection/test water, extra components and replacement/retest use depend on actual records | foreground installation and assembly integration | 1 Item(s) accepted stub-bounded tank installation |

The single node owns excavation/support, vessel integration, backfill/finish and the inspection/repair loop. Damaged tank, incompatible connection, failed inspection or leakage is an off-spec state inside tank_installation until repaired and retested, returned under actual product custody, or discarded via the actual waste destination. A failed state is never an accepted second installation. No document receipt, permit or test certificate is a separate production node. Variable cards below expand to zero, one or multiple independently identified actual exchanges; heterogeneous materials, fuels, waste types or emitted substances are not summed into one generic flow.

Evidence for nonoccurrence is required; missing identity, quantity or condition remains a completion gap. No amount or occurrence is inferred from the other child flows. Complete supplied products and contaminated carriers include their contained parts/material once.

- Selected flow: Usable separately supplied tank gasket returned outward
- Flow property / unit: Number of items / Item(s)
- Amount rule: Independently count only the actual outward transfer of this complete usable product in Item(s), accepted by its named recipient at the documented handover. Match the original supplied SKU/configuration, usable state and selected Count/Item(s) reference; retain receipt/return IDs and upstream burden custody without a second return deduction. Closing stock, internal correction and discarded waste do not enter this product quantity. Normalize the attributable outward count once by the original accepted-service denominator; kg is an auxiliary measurement, not a second exchanged view.

## 7. Allocation and Co-product Handling

| rule_id | Applies to | Rule | source_ids |
| --- | --- | --- | --- |
| job_attribution | tank_installation | Attribute direct actual job materials/energy/site work including failures, repair and retest to the finally accepted job. Internal repair loops do not create another accepted output. Incompatible configurations or incomplete jobs are separated and disclosed, never denominator dilution. |  |
| asset_attribution | `equipment_provision_excavator`; `equipment_provision_compactor`; `equipment_provision_lifting`; `equipment_provision_hole_saw` | For each asset index production, each service/reporting period and consumer job, maintenance/replacement and final removal. Use actual documented service activity shares against complete supported service coverage, with residual/unused capacity explained. Retain capital/maintenance/removal burdens or verified provider inclusion once; fill missing provider phases explicitly and avoid duplicating included operational fuel. Do not assume universal lifetime or amortization. |  |
| custody_attribution | `usable_product_returns_tank`; `usable_product_returns_gasket`; `usable_product_returns_clean_native_soil`; `solid_waste_tank`; `solid_waste_soil`; actual exchanges required by `refine_imported_support_fill` | Maintain gross opening stock/receipts/issues/installed or consumed disposition/real outward returns/waste/closing stock balance by actual identity. All material input cards use gross job receipts/issues; placement or consumption is a disposition, not an alternate input basis. Consumed-fuel exchanges exclude unused/returned fuel reconciled separately. Retained stock carries a declared unconsumed burden forward and is not a product output. Returned products have original-lot burden custody and do not earn automatic substitution credit. Native soil reused onsite has handling burdens and no purchased-production burden. Any genuine coproduct outside this scope requires explicit separate allocation review. |  |


## 8. Foreground Data Collection, Calculation, and Quality Rules

### Data Collection Protocols

Record each actual child/refined exchange independently by identity, physical event, state, gate and period. Retain all original obligations even where a corresponding exchange identity is not yet known. Do not allocate a family total or copy its numerical Range to children, count a carrier and its contained material twice, or turn missing occurrence/quantity/native reference into zero. Each concrete exchange has one property and one unit; other CP readings are auxiliary and require evidenced conversion. Missing required refinement blocks dataset completion. Count-supplied tank/gasket outward exchanges retain Item(s); measured kg is auxiliary balance evidence, never a second return flow.

Pair native-origin soil export with cp_components outward-custody record using transfer_id and actual measured mass, preserving site provenance rather than a purchased lot. Record local placement/compaction/grade acceptance with actual units and limits; onsite soil transfer creates no purchased input. Record each actual child/refined exchange independently by identity, physical event, state, gate and period. Retain all original obligations even where a corresponding exchange identity is not yet known. Do not allocate a family total or copy its numerical Range to children, count a carrier and its contained material twice, or turn missing occurrence/quantity/native reference into zero.

Any activity allocation uses recorded tasks and a documented denominator; identify provider included use and future operating-energy exclusion. Reconcile unused stock and unconsumed fuel returns outside the consumed-fuel exchange. Preserve each physical unit and conversion evidence. Record each actual child/refined exchange independently by identity, physical event, state, gate and period. Retain all original obligations even where a corresponding exchange identity is not yet known. Do not allocate a family total or copy its numerical Range to children, count a carrier and its contained material twice, or turn missing occurrence/quantity/native reference into zero.

Retain actual job hours or contract unit and complete-life service basis; document phase-by-phase provider inclusion, operational/capital separation, any gaps, allocation and no duplicate event ownership. Record each actual child/refined exchange independently by identity, physical event, state, gate and period. Retain all original obligations even where a corresponding exchange identity is not yet known. Do not allocate a family total or copy its numerical Range to children, count a carrier and its contained material twice, or turn missing occurrence/quantity/native reference into zero.

| `refine_extra_pipe_tees` | `extra_pipe_tees_stub`; `extra_pipe_tees_tee` | Preserve this actual collection and closure scope as a mandatory dataset-production requirement: Inlet/outlet stub endpoints and actual code-approved tee arrangement define this component boundary; building drain and drainfield pipe are excluded. Range evidence need: Actual stub endpoint/length/diameter/wall thickness units, pipe/tee bill, measured mass or verified linear mass and local configuration are required. Independently establish every actual identity, state, real provider/receiver and exactly one exchange property/unit before constructing its flow card. Each actual exchange requires its own recorded quantity and applicable method, uncertainty and custody/fate coverage. Auxiliary CP units do not authorize extra exchange views. Actual occurrence unknown is not zero; never invent a material/species/provider list or split a parent total. Quantitative screening evidence must fit each actual exchange; a former family interval cannot be copied or divided into child ranges. Further actual identities not fully specified by the conditional children require mandatory refinement and prevent dataset completion; this requirement is not itself a flow exchange. Other actual component models/materials need independent records; building drain and drainfield pipe outside defined stubs. | `cp_components`; actual independent records and identity/unit evidence |
| `refine_extra_access_parts` | `extra_access_parts_riser`; `extra_access_parts_lid` | Preserve this actual collection and closure scope as a mandatory dataset-production requirement: Access components required by the actual cover/model and local approval are integrated into the installed tank.

Actual separately supplied compatible joint/connection products by formulation/state/native unit and method; factory seals not duplicate and actual release composition separately recorded. | `cp_components`; actual independent records and identity/unit evidence |
| `refine_imported_support_fill` | actual independently refined exchanges | Preserve this actual collection and closure scope as a mandatory dataset-production requirement: Suitable native support may avoid imported bedding; imported material is included when actual soil support/backfill requires it. In-situ native soil movement remains in the soil ledger. Range evidence need: Actual excavation/support design, native-soil suitability, imported material weigh tickets/moisture, and field placed/stock balance are required; model examples do not prescribe universal volume or density.

Quantitative screening evidence must fit each actual exchange; a former family interval cannot be copied or divided into child ranges. Further actual identities not fully specified by the conditional children require mandatory refinement and prevent dataset completion; this requirement is not itself a flow exchange. Actual independently imported material/grade/moisture/state/SKU in one unit, weighed or originally allowed evidenced density bridge, native suitable soil movements retain soil ledger without purchased upstream burden. | `cp_soil`; actual independent records and identity/unit evidence |

Actual occurrence unknown is not zero; never invent a material/species/provider list or split a parent total. Quantitative screening evidence must fit each actual exchange; a former family interval cannot be copied or divided into child ranges. Further actual identities not fully specified by the conditional children require mandatory refinement and prevent dataset completion; this requirement is not itself a flow exchange. Each actual fuel/equipment/task supply has unique native unit, actual volume/density state for any mass bridge, independent burned activity, stock/return and nonreturned waste/loss upstream supply burden; no provider-inclusive duplicate. | `cp_energy`; actual independent records and identity/unit evidence |

Provider-supplied services and owned assets need explicit nonduplicated coverage; service identity is not machine mass. Range evidence need: Actual asset id, installation task hours, all lifetime service periods/jobs, replacement/termination records and verified provider coverage are required; no universal lifetime, hours or ownership allocation. Independently establish every actual identity, state, real provider/receiver and exactly one exchange property/unit before constructing its flow card.

| `refine_usable_product_returns` | `usable_product_returns_tank`; `usable_product_returns_gasket`; `usable_product_returns_clean_native_soil` | Preserve this actual collection and closure scope as a mandatory dataset-production requirement: Usable components, packaging or legally transferred clean soil leave as product only with actual accepted custody and intended-use evidence; retained closing stock is not an outward exchange. For native-origin clean-soil export, preserve site/excavation provenance in cp_soil and the same transfer_id in cp_components outward-custody records; no original purchased-product lot or upstream soil production burden is required. For counted tank/gasket returns, the exchange uses the same Number of items / Item(s) as the received product. Retain the matching item/serial count and independently measured or traceable product-specific kg for the same transfer_id as auxiliary physical-balance evidence only; no default conversion and no second kg return exchange. Range evidence need: Actual receiving-party acceptance, usable condition, component identity/mass and transfer/return note are required; no assumed reuse credit or recovery fraction. Native soil needs cp_soil source-state/provenance and actual mass evidence. Returned counted vessels/gaskets need matching actual mass evidence and transfer_id.

Actual other components/packaging/material returns require original identity/state/recipient/native unit and burden bridge. Count-to-mass source observations retained only as nonadditive auxiliary; no separate kg return for same counted tank/gasket. | `cp_components`; actual independent records and identity/unit evidence |
| `refine_solid_waste` | `solid_waste_tank`; `solid_waste_soil` | Preserve this actual collection and closure scope as a mandatory dataset-production requirement: Waste custody includes rejected vessels and unsuitable/exported soil that actually has waste status. Supplier-managed packaging/waste already covered upstream is reconciled; usable returns are separate. Range evidence need: Actual waste classification, weigh/destination tickets and included-service evidence are required for each stream; no generic all-soil waste label or displaced-production credit. Independently establish every actual identity, state, real provider/receiver and exactly one exchange property/unit before constructing its flow card. Each actual exchange requires its own recorded quantity and applicable method, uncertainty and custody/fate coverage. Auxiliary CP units do not authorize extra exchange views. Actual occurrence unknown is not zero; never invent a material/species/provider list or split a parent total. Quantitative screening evidence must fit each actual exchange; a former family interval cannot be copied or divided into child ranges. Further actual identities not fully specified by the conditional children require mandatory refinement and prevent dataset completion; this requirement is not itself a flow exchange. Actual other discarded components, packaging and hazardous/composite/receiver differences need independent identities; supplier-covered management not double, no fictitious excavation soil production. | `cp_waste`; actual independent records and identity/unit evidence |
| `refine_direct_releases` | actual independently refined exchanges | Preserve this actual collection and closure scope as a mandatory dataset-production requirement: Potential machine exhaust, dust, joint-product release or lawful direct water release requires actual substance/media evidence. Waste shipments are not elementary emissions; background/provider-covered emissions are not added twice. Range evidence need: Actual substance identity, medium, measured or sourced factor and activity, abatement and uncertainty are required; broad exhaust/dust or discharged water mass cannot stand in for a pollutant UUID. Independently establish every actual identity, state, real provider/receiver and exactly one exchange property/unit before constructing its flow card. Each actual exchange requires its own recorded quantity and applicable method, uncertainty and custody/fate coverage. Auxiliary CP units do not authorize extra exchange views. Actual occurrence unknown is not zero; never invent a material/species/provider list or split a parent total. Quantitative screening evidence must fit each actual exchange; a former family interval cannot be copied or divided into child ranges. Further actual identities not fully specified by the conditional children require mandatory refinement and prevent dataset completion; this requirement is not itself a flow exchange. Actual substance, disjoint particle-size fraction and air/water/soil receiving compartment; matched measurement or species/activity factor, whole-fluid composition/fate audit, capture and uncertainty; unknown is not zero. | `cp_waste`; actual independent records and identity/unit evidence |
| `atomic_exchange_identity_unit` | all inventory rows | Each concrete flow card identifies exactly one actual independently supplied product/SKU/formulation, complete assembly, complete single-function or genuine complete bounded provider service, actual waste composite/state/receiver, or substance/size/receiving medium, with exactly one property and unit. Different actual identities require independent quantities and records, not a summed family exchange. A complete product/carrier includes its contents once. Same unchanged SKU/state usable supply/return pairs and matched physical internal send/receive pairs use the same selected property/unit; kg and count or MJ and kWh auxiliaries are nonadditive measurements, never duplicate exchanges. Missing identity/occurrence/quantity/native reference is a gap, not zero. Any pooled denominator retains original configuration strata, accepted state/gate and actual causal attribution; no unlike jobs/branches/routes treated as equivalent. | actual identity, unit, custody and independent quantity evidence |
| `asset_final_normalization_once` | all inventory rows | An asset-equivalent formula already ending in division by N, D or A is the final quantity per reference flow. Its complete-life fraction and accepted-output normalization constitute the same normalization operation as the general normalization rule; never divide it by that denominator again. Apply the complete-life upstream burden exactly once. Actual complete provider event counts remain event quantities, not owned-asset fractions. | actual identity, unit, custody and independent quantity evidence |
