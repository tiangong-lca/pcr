# Wall-mounted intermittent axial extract fan installation services

## 1. Scope and Applicability

Scope is restricted to Class II double-insulated fans; Class I fans requiring earthing are excluded.

This PCR covers first installation of a packaged basic intermittent axial extract fan on an accepted preexisting wall sleeve and exterior grille, using an accepted existing isolated fixed electrical supply. The representative route is the Vent-Axia VASF100B basic model: two installer-selected speeds and remote or light-switch operation. The representative manual constrains that example, not every fan sold under this category. An equivalent model requires its own installation evidence and compatible qualifiers. [vent-axia-494229j0626, pp. 3–6]

Included work comprises receipt and unpacking, substrate-compatible backplate fixing, actual fixing-hole drilling or an inspected preprepared-hole route, local connection materials, speed selection, cover engagement, electrical verification, limited functional and delivered-extraction testing, correction of failed work, cleanup, attributable site resources and signed handover. Declare the project extraction acceptance criterion before testing. The reference is an installed service meeting that criterion, with no whole-building airflow or room ventilation guarantee.

Exclude construction of a core penetration, new sleeve, external grille, new branch circuit or new isolation point; long duct systems, heat recovery, air conditioning, continuous-running fans, timer/humidity variants, later maintenance and ordinary ventilation use. If the starting interfaces fail acceptance or require new construction, stop this route and describe the extra service under a separately reviewed boundary. Do not relabel the work to retain this PCR.

## 4. Measurement and Unit Rules

| rule_id | Applies to | Required property | Required unit | Rule |
| --- | --- | --- | --- | --- |
| service_count | reference product | Number of items | Item(s) | Count only fan installations passing all declared gates; different models, speed states, interfaces and extraction criteria require disaggregated records, not assumed equivalence. |
| energy_record | installation_electricity | Energy | kWh | Preserve measured electrical energy and actual test/installation time. Rated power or rated air flow alone cannot determine energy or delivered extraction; record any unit conversion and measurement uncertainty. |
| material_conversion | `fastening_components_screw`; `fastening_components_wall_plug`; `connection_components_cable`; `ancillary_consumables_water`; `ancillary_consumables_dust_bag`; actual exchanges required by `refine_site_fuel` | Mass | kg | Convert dimensions, counts or fuel volumes only using traceable actual-product mass or density evidence and declared conditions; do not equate one appliance with one kilogram. |


## 5. System Boundary

### Boundary Abstraction

| Field | Value |
| --- | --- |
| declared_starting_condition | Existing accepted sleeve, exterior guard, suitable wall substrate and compliant isolated fixed supply/connection point; purchased fan and separately added components at declared upstream supply gate |
| starting_condition_role | Prior constructed interfaces are fixed boundary inputs to the service description, not newly produced sleeve/grille/circuit exchanges |
| product_classification_scope | Narrow installation subset of CPC 3.0 54632; classification does not establish material or service flow identity |
| recursive_input_rule | A purchased fan-installation service in the same category is an upstream service input with a declared gate and non-overlapping work schedule. Do not expand and charge that same work again as own foreground installation. |
| upstream_dataset_requirement | Use state-, model-, geography-, supply-gate- and unit-compatible datasets for the appliance, actual components, electricity, freight and waste handling. Declare manufacture/delivery/packaging coverage and gaps; a missing dataset does not erase the input. |
| disclosure | Identify all accepted prior interfaces and excluded construction, actual drilling route, resource attribution, capital-tool treatment, data gaps, waste destinations and the handover gate. |

Declare the project extraction acceptance criterion before testing. The reference is an installed service meeting that criterion, with no whole-building airflow or room ventilation guarantee. Exclude construction of a core penetration, new sleeve, external grille, new branch circuit or new isolation point; long duct systems, heat recovery, air conditioning, continuous-running fans, timer/humidity variants, later maintenance and ordinary ventilation use. If the starting interfaces fail acceptance or require new construction, stop this route and describe the extra service under a separately reviewed boundary. Do not relabel the work to retain this PCR. | `vent-axia-494229j0626` |
| existing_interfaces | fan_installation | Inspect and record sleeve length/slope, external guard suitability and supply compatibility before work. The representative manual requires an outward downward sleeve slope and a wall-kit duct length of at least 100 mm from fan backplate to inside external grille. These are example-specific interface checks, not a universal sleeve construction inventory. | `vent-axia-494229j0626` |
| class_ii_connection | fan_installation | For the representative 220–240 V 50 Hz Class II fan, use fixed wiring and rear cable entry; it must not be earthed. Verify the actual 0.75–1.5 mm² supply-cord compatibility and appropriate basic-model wiring diagram. Perform connection and speed selection while isolated; apply the actual model instructions when different. | `vent-axia-494229j0626` |
| complete_installation | fan_installation | Include actual marking/drilling/plugging/screwing and electrical/extraction verification, electricity and cleanup. With preprepared fixing holes retain inspection evidence; do not silently remove drilling or its debris. Declare separately supplied component roles and avoid counting integral parts twice. | `vent-axia-494229j0626` |
| gate_exclusions | fan_installation | Close the service only after secure mounting, free impeller and shutters, all cover clips engaged, correct fixed connection, selected speed and recorded actual electrical and extraction acceptance. The manual gives mounting/wiring checks; the producer declares the project extraction test method and criterion. Post-handover ventilation electricity and existing interface construction are outside this dataset. | `vent-axia-494229j0626` |
| resource_scope | fan_installation | Under cp_energy and cp_transport include attributable transport, task power, consumed materials and waste handling. Declare portable-tool capital manufacture/lifetime treatment and any exclusion; operational tool energy and wear consumables remain included. Do not claim complete capital coverage where it is excluded. Identify shared vehicles, tools, charging and site services, enumerate fan_installation and every other actual consuming job/node with its relevant period, and retain a unique resource-event identifier. |  |

## 7. Allocation and Co-product Handling

| rule_id | Applies to | Rule | source_ids |
| --- | --- | --- | --- |
| single_service | fan_installation | The intended output is the accepted installation service; product returns and waste are not accepted services or automatic co-products. Retain all attributable failed-work and retest burdens in the declared cohort. No recovery or avoided-product credit is inferred. |  |
| shared_resources | fan_installation | Prefer task-specific measurements. Under cp_energy and cp_transport allocate shared job resources from documented activity drivers across all actual consumers, reconcile their shares to the whole job and disclose the selected driver and sensitivity. Do not charge the same meter interval, freight leg or tool burden twice. For each shared asset/service list fan_installation and every other actual consumer, record their service periods/jobs and measured driver, allocation rationale, denominator, share and evidence; if no sharing occurs record the single-consumer fact. |  |
| reject_paths | fan_installation | Link each failed fan or mounting/connection defect to its installation. Internal correction loops remain in this node; unused/repairable product exits use `returned_components_fan`; discarded material uses `rejected_waste_cable_offcut` and its actual route. Retain correction inputs/energy; unresolved failures cannot enter accepted_installation. |  |

### Calculation Rules

| rule_id | Applies to | Formula or rule | Inputs | Output | source_ids |
| --- | --- | --- | --- | --- | --- |
| cohort_attribution | all inventory rows | For each actual exchange, retain the whole-job quantity and the documented attributable share; divide the attributable total by accepted installations in the same disclosed campaign. Do not dilute failed jobs through a different cohort or include unresolved acceptance in the denominator. | cp_materials; cp_energy; cp_transport; cp_waste; cp_emissions; cp_acceptance | Quantity per reference flow with allocation and uncertainty schedule |  |
| electrical_consumption | installation_electricity | Prefer the change in actual energy-meter reading. An estimate uses measured operating power and recorded task duration with explicit compatible unit conversion; disclose method, standby/charging coverage and uncertainty. Nameplate power alone is insufficient. | cp_energy | Attributable installation and test electricity |  |
| component_reconciliation | fan_appliance; `fastening_components_screw`; `fastening_components_wall_plug`; `connection_components_cable`; `ancillary_consumables_water`; `ancillary_consumables_dust_bag`; `returned_components_fan`; `packaging_waste_carton`; `packaging_waste_plastic`; drilling_debris; `rejected_waste_cable_offcut` | Reconcile incoming quantities, installed quantities, product returns, waste and stock changes by actual material or appliance identity; keep generated substrate debris separate from purchased-component balance. | cp_materials; cp_waste; cp_acceptance | Traceable component/return/reject schedule and explained discrepancies |  |

### Data Quality Requirements

| requirement_id | Applies to | Requirement | Evidence |
| --- | --- | --- | --- |
| configuration_trace | all inventory rows | Preserve actual configuration, time/site, material identity and gate, instrument/source and compatible upstream datasets. Split materially different fans and installation conditions. | cp_materials; cp_acceptance |
| completeness | all inventory rows | Record all actual required and conditional operations. Unknown material, emission, waste destination or resource attribution is disclosed as a gap. Missing measurements do not justify zero or generic defaults. | cp_materials; cp_energy; cp_transport; cp_waste; cp_emissions |
| range_evidence | all inventory rows | No transferable quantitative Range is asserted. Appliance/fixing masses, power-time, transport, waste and extraction depend on the actual installation. Collect evidence for empirical ranges before claiming defaults; record the missing range evidence and assess sensitivity. The exact final service count is a normalization definition, not a yield prior. | Actual measurements, representative cohorts and uncertainty assessment |
| acceptance_quality | accepted_installation | Retain delivered-extraction method, selected-speed state, measurement conditions and prior project criterion. A manufacturer-rated flow is not the installed delivered flow. Preserve failed results and retests. | cp_acceptance; vent-axia-494229j0626 |
| `refine_fastening_components` | `fastening_components_screw`; `fastening_components_wall_plug` | Preserve this actual collection and closure scope as a mandatory dataset-production requirement: Actual screws, plugs and any approved fixing accessories join the backplate to the accepted wall.

No numeric Range is asserted. Independently establish every actual identity, state, real provider/receiver and exactly one exchange property/unit before constructing its flow card. Each actual exchange requires its own recorded quantity and applicable method, uncertainty and custody/fate coverage. Auxiliary CP units do not authorize extra exchange views. Actual occurrence unknown is not zero; never invent a material/species/provider list or split a parent total. Quantitative screening evidence must fit each actual exchange; a former family interval cannot be copied or divided into child ranges. Further actual identities not fully specified by the conditional children require mandatory refinement and prevent dataset completion; this requirement is not itself a flow exchange. Other approved actual fixing accessories require exact material/specification/SKU and independently measured quantity, exclude fan packet internal parts. | `cp_materials`; actual independent records and identity/unit evidence |

Independently establish every actual identity, state, real provider/receiver and exactly one exchange property/unit before constructing its flow card. Each actual exchange requires its own recorded quantity and applicable method, uncertainty and custody/fate coverage. Auxiliary CP units do not authorize extra exchange views.

Whole prewetted products include water once. | `cp_materials`; actual independent records and identity/unit evidence |
| `refine_site_fuel` | actual independently refined exchanges | Preserve this actual collection and closure scope as a mandatory dataset-production requirement: Conditional fuel for installer-operated vehicles, generators or other actual site equipment is identified separately by fuel and use.

Quantitative screening evidence must fit each actual exchange; a former family interval cannot be copied or divided into child ranges. Further actual identities not fully specified by the conditional children require mandatory refinement and prevent dataset completion; this requirement is not itself a flow exchange. Actual installer-owned fuel supplies by carrier and unique unit; retain upstream nonreturned unburned waste/loss burden, separate burned activity and disjoint stock/return/waste/release; purchased freight provider fuel not duplicate. | `cp_energy`; actual independent records and identity/unit evidence |
| `refine_returned_components` | `returned_components_fan` | Preserve this actual collection and closure scope as a mandatory dataset-production requirement: Actual reusable packaging and unused or repairable fan appliances, cable, fixings or other materials leave for identified reuse, stores or supplier return as products, separated by actual identity. A defective assembly awaiting repair cannot enter acceptance; discarded material belongs in rejected waste. Range evidence need: Weighed product-return mass by component or reusable packaging identity and traceable count/length conversions are needed; unused-return fractions cannot be assumed. No numeric Range is asserted. Independently establish every actual identity, state, real provider/receiver and exactly one exchange property/unit before constructing its flow card. Each actual exchange requires its own recorded quantity and applicable method, uncertainty and custody/fate coverage. Auxiliary CP units do not authorize extra exchange views.

Quantitative screening evidence must fit each actual exchange; a former family interval cannot be copied or divided into child ranges. Further actual identities not fully specified by the conditional children require mandatory refinement and prevent dataset completion; this requirement is not itself a flow exchange. Actual returned cable/fixing/packaging/other products need exact inbound matching identity/state/native property/unit and quantity; stock/internal corrections not exits, discarded waste separate. | `cp_materials`; actual independent records and identity/unit evidence |
| `refine_packaging_waste` | `packaging_waste_carton`; `packaging_waste_plastic` | Preserve this actual collection and closure scope as a mandatory dataset-production requirement: Actual carton, plastic or other packaging removed from fan and ancillary products leaves for its declared collection/treatment route. Reusable packaging returned as a product is recorded separately in the foreground schedule. Range evidence need: Actual unpacked SKU, packaging material, separated mass, reuse/return and collection destinations are needed; no packaging-waste fraction is inferred. No numeric Range is asserted. Independently establish every actual identity, state, real provider/receiver and exactly one exchange property/unit before constructing its flow card. Each actual exchange requires its own recorded quantity and applicable method, uncertainty and custody/fate coverage. Auxiliary CP units do not authorize extra exchange views. Actual occurrence unknown is not zero; never invent a material/species/provider list or split a parent total. Quantitative screening evidence must fit each actual exchange; a former family interval cannot be copied or divided into child ranges. Further actual identities not fully specified by the conditional children require mandatory refinement and prevent dataset completion; this requirement is not itself a flow exchange. Other actual mixed/composite/contaminated packaging or receiver differences require independent identities; usable packaging returns not waste, no guessed mixed-total shares. | `cp_waste`; actual independent records and identity/unit evidence |
| `refine_rejected_waste` | `rejected_waste_cable_offcut` | Preserve this actual collection and closure scope as a mandatory dataset-production requirement: Broken fan parts, cut cable, damaged fixings and spent cleanup materials are linked to the installation node and their actual disposal or recovery destinations. In-place correction is an internal loop, whose extra inputs, energy and waste remain in this node. Range evidence need: Actual defect/cutting/cleanup records and segregated mass/destination for discarded materials are needed, distinct from usable returns; no default reject fraction is supported. No numeric Range is asserted. Independently establish every actual identity, state, real provider/receiver and exactly one exchange property/unit before constructing its flow card. Each actual exchange requires its own recorded quantity and applicable method, uncertainty and custody/fate coverage. Auxiliary CP units do not authorize extra exchange views. Actual occurrence unknown is not zero; never invent a material/species/provider list or split a parent total. Quantitative screening evidence must fit each actual exchange; a former family interval cannot be copied or divided into child ranges. Further actual identities not fully specified by the conditional children require mandatory refinement and prevent dataset completion; this requirement is not itself a flow exchange.

| `refine_direct_emissions` | actual independently refined exchanges | Preserve this actual collection and closure scope as a mandatory dataset-production requirement: Conditional uncollected drilling particles and any actual onsite fuel-combustion or other installation releases require substance/species, particle-size basis where relevant and receiving medium before a concrete exchange is selected. Captured debris is waste, never an air emission. Range evidence need: Actual release activity, pollutant/species, particle-size basis, receiving medium, controls and measured or defensible activity-factor evidence are needed before emission intervals; missing evidence remains a gap. No numeric Range is asserted. Independently establish every actual identity, state, real provider/receiver and exactly one exchange property/unit before constructing its flow card. Each actual exchange requires its own recorded quantity and applicable method, uncertainty and custody/fate coverage. Auxiliary CP units do not authorize extra exchange views.

Quantitative screening evidence must fit each actual exchange; a former family interval cannot be copied or divided into child ranges. Further actual identities not fully specified by the conditional children require mandatory refinement and prevent dataset completion; this requirement is not itself a flow exchange. Actual substance, disjoint particle-size fraction and air/water/soil receiving compartment; matched measurement or species/activity factor, whole-fluid composition/fate audit, capture and uncertainty; unknown is not zero. | `cp_emissions`; actual independent records and identity/unit evidence |
| `atomic_exchange_identity_unit` | all inventory rows | Each concrete flow card identifies exactly one actual independently supplied product/SKU/formulation, complete assembly, complete single-function or genuine complete bounded provider service, actual waste composite/state/receiver, or substance/size/receiving medium, with exactly one property and unit. Different actual identities require independent quantities and records, not a summed family exchange. A complete product/carrier includes its contents once. Same unchanged SKU/state usable supply/return pairs and matched physical internal send/receive pairs use the same selected property/unit; kg and count or MJ and kWh auxiliaries are nonadditive measurements, never duplicate exchanges. Missing identity/occurrence/quantity/native reference is a gap, not zero. Any pooled denominator must retain the original accepted configuration strata, state/gate and causal attribution; do not divide unlike circuits, routes, products or jobs as if they were equivalent. | actual identity, unit, custody and independent quantity evidence |
| `asset_final_normalization_once` | all inventory rows | An asset-equivalent formula already ending in division by N, D or A is the final quantity per reference flow. Its complete-life fraction and accepted-output normalization constitute the same normalization operation as the general normalization rule; never divide it by that denominator again. Apply the complete-life upstream burden exactly once. Actual complete provider event counts remain event quantities, not owned-asset fractions. | actual identity, unit, custody and independent quantity evidence |
