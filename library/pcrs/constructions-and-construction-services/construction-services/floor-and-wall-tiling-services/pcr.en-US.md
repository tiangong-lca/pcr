# Bonded interior ceramic floor tiling services

## 1. Scope and Applicability

This category measures an installation service on a previously accepted, stable, dry, clean and suitably flat interior substrate. Work covers layout, cutting ceramic floor tile, water-mixed cementitious thinset, bonding and setting, cementitious grouting, specified movement-joint treatment and final cleanup. Wall, stone, epoxy, thick-bed, exterior and submerged systems are excluded. Substrate manufacture, major levelling or repair, waterproofing membranes, demolition and later building use are separate responsibilities.

| Field | Value |
| --- | --- |
| Reference amount | 1 |
| Reference product flow | Accepted bonded interior ceramic tiled floor service |
| Reference flow property | Area `93a60a56-a3c8-19da-a746-0800200c9a66` |

## 5. System Boundary

### Boundary Abstraction

| Field | Value |
| --- | --- |
| declared_starting_condition | Accepted ready existing interior substrate; no major correction or membrane work remains |
| starting_condition_role | Supplied prerequisite outside installation service foreground |
| product_classification_scope | Narrower interior ceramic floor subset of cpc:3.0:54740 |
| recursive_input_rule | Do not recurse from intermediate floor-area handoffs into another full tiling service. External same-category subcontract work needs a separate, non-overlapping location and boundary record. |
| upstream_dataset_requirement | Link purchased tile, formulated thinset/grout, water, electricity and actual consumables to compatible upstream datasets; disclose excluded substrate/membrane burdens. |
| disclosure | Declare the ready-substrate supplier gate, omitted work, internal transfers, joint design, shared-resource ownership and waste custody gates. |

### Boundary Rules

| rule_id | Applies to | Rule | source_ids |
| --- | --- | --- | --- |
| `scope_eligibility` | foreground_system_boundary | This category measures an installation service on a previously accepted, stable, dry, clean and suitably flat interior substrate. Work covers layout, cutting ceramic floor tile, water-mixed cementitious thinset, bonding and setting, cementitious grouting, specified movement-joint treatment and final cleanup. Wall, stone, epoxy, thick-bed, exterior and submerged systems are excluded. Substrate manufacture, major levelling or repair, waterproofing membranes, demolition and later building use are separate responsibilities. |  |
| ready_substrate | foreground_boundary | Require a signed readiness inspection; if major repair, levelling or membrane work is needed, stop this scope and assign a separate dataset. | laticrete-thinsets |
| service_gate | all_processes | Finish at accepted net floor area after specified joint treatment and cleanup. Measure actual water, powder, paste and cut-tile transfers; no assumed hydration yield or reaction emission. | mapei-floor-installation |
| burden_ownership | shared_access_service; shared_tool_service | Own shared asset service once in grout_finish with all consuming nodes and dates; meter operational energy at consuming nodes and remove that energy from the shared service. |  |
| waste_gate | all_processes | Captured slurry, dust and residues leave as custodial waste. Actual elementary releases require reported substance, size where relevant, receiving medium and quantity; a blank observation is not zero. |  |

## 6. Process Inventory Structure

Production is indexed by work lot, room, mixing batch and cleanup event. Cutting supplies prepared tiles; mortar mixing supplies wet paste. Bonding joins both onto the supplied substrate, and hydration changes the adhesive to its set state before the measured ungrouted area is released. Grout mixing supplies a separate paste; finishing fills joints, allows actual cementitious setting, treats required movement joints and cleans before acceptance. No pathway, hydration ratio, strength or generic elapsed time is imposed. Defective work returns to its producing operation with burdens retained; removed material is waste, never accepted output.

Preserve complete supplied products, formulations, assemblies, bounded services and actual mixed-waste carriers as whole views; do not add their already included constituents. Usable outward exits match the original input property/unit and require actual custody transfer; closing stock is not an exit and usable original-state items are not waste. Waste retains its producing node, actual contamination/state, receiver and treatment boundary and is not an environmental emission. The same physical cable or SKU serving several duties is counted once, with duty observations nonadditive. Evidence is required for nonoccurrence; this card assumes no occurrence, composition, count or loss factor.

Original role-specific boundary and operating constraints apply only to this independent child; the former family/screen text is neither another exchange nor an inherited Range: Resolve each cardboard, plastic or pallet exchange from records; avoid a generic packaging UUID. The wide waste screen accommodates wet/dry state, retained water, cutting layout, batch residue and rework; it is not an expected waste rate.

- Selected flow: Discarded tile cardboard packaging

Range evidence need: independent actual child quantities, identity/state, conversions, uncertainty and comparable independent observations; no family interval or default coefficient is inherited.

###### Discarded product pallet (`mortar_packaging_pallet`)

One actual discarded product pallet. This is a conditional independent object supported within the original mortar_packaging scope; activate only when actually independently supplied, used or dispatched. Keep actual SKU, material/formulation, specification, state and provider or receiver. Preserve complete supplied products, formulations, assemblies, bounded services and actual mixed-waste carriers as whole views; do not add their already included constituents. Usable outward exits match the original input property/unit and require actual custody transfer; closing stock is not an exit and usable original-state items are not waste. Waste retains its producing node, actual contamination/state, receiver and treatment boundary and is not an environmental emission. The same physical cable or SKU serving several duties is counted once, with duty observations nonadditive. Evidence is required for nonoccurrence; this card assumes no occurrence, composition, count or loss factor.

Original role-specific boundary and operating constraints apply only to this independent child; the former family/screen text is neither another exchange nor an inherited Range: Segregate actual bag, container and pallet materials and retained/reused packaging. The wide waste screen accommodates wet/dry state, retained water, cutting layout, batch residue and rework; it is not an expected waste rate.

Preserve complete supplied products, formulations, assemblies, bounded services and actual mixed-waste carriers as whole views; do not add their already included constituents. Usable outward exits match the original input property/unit and require actual custody transfer; closing stock is not an exit and usable original-state items are not waste. Waste retains its producing node, actual contamination/state, receiver and treatment boundary and is not an environmental emission. The same physical cable or SKU serving several duties is counted once, with duty observations nonadditive. Evidence is required for nonoccurrence; this card assumes no occurrence, composition, count or loss factor.

Original role-specific boundary and operating constraints apply only to this independent child; the former family/screen text is neither another exchange nor an inherited Range: Apply when required by the actual joint design; record sealant chemistry, backing, length, cross-section and cure requirement. The material screen is broad because product thickness, formulation, geometry, temporary aids and rework vary; actual product/lot measurements determine the value.

## 7. Allocation and Co-product Handling

| rule_id | Applies to | Rule | source_ids |
| --- | --- | --- | --- |
| subdivide | all_processes | First subdivide by room, lot, batch and measured event. For shared meters allocate by logged operating time and power or actual submeter evidence, documenting residual uncertainty; sum shares to the measured total. |  |
| single_owner | shared_access_service; shared_tool_service | Keep one event owner for common access/equipment service; record all five consumers and period. Exclude metered energy and duplicated contractor invoices from this service. |  |
| rework | all_processes | Charge rework inputs, cleanup and rejected material to the same accepted work lot. Link replacement operations and exits by defect id. Do not count an intermediate area or a failed area as final output. |  |
| stock | whole_tiles | Gross tile issue = opening stock + receipts - closing stock; use gross issue as whole_tiles input and record external usable returns once as tile_return output. Net consumption = gross issue - external returns is a separate upstream burden attribution quantity, not another physical exchange or negative credit. Only original upstream burdens of the actual unused returned material may follow the return; installation and rework burdens stay with the accepted service, with no automatic avoided-production credit. Closing stock and external returns are mutually exclusive; waste is already inside consumption and is never deducted again. |  |

## 8. Foreground Data Collection, Calculation, and Quality Rules

Each protocol owns one node. Use transfer ids to pair sending and receiving records, separate fresh water from recirculation and identify cleanup/changeover ownership. Record all materials as dry/wet state and product/lot. Actual supplier instructions govern water dose, trowel selection, cure and cleaning conditions. Do not borrow numeric defaults from a different product. Provisional ranges are deliberately broad prompts for checking missing records; they are neither observed facts nor defaults, conformity limits or evidence of zero when inactive. Investigate an outlier and retain its evidence rather than clipping it.

Weigh gross/tare or use count and measured same-product unit_mass; for water use measured mass or volume and measured density; Retain meter_start/end, meter_unit, all shared_consumers and driver_node/drivers_total; For each actual release record species, size, receiving_medium, concentration, exhaust_volume and unit_conversion, or direct measured mass. Select one documented measurement_route per event; record calibration and wet/dry state. Pair transfers and record inactive exchanges explicitly; obtain A from signed grout_finish acceptance for the same lot. Count or weigh actual tiles issued to cutting separately from purchasing receipts and mutually exclusive closing stock/returns; preserve layout and reusable-piece records. Retain the original PCR stock, event, denominator, attribution and closure methods above. Maintain an actual-child register by node, period and parent_ledger_id. Each quantity-bearing exchange has one independent physical product, complete formulation/assembly, defined bounded service, actual waste carrier or substance/medium, one fixed property/unit and its independently collected numerator. Retain all original roles, corrections and stock/WIP/fate records. Former family quantities remain non-exchange custody or closure diagnostics only; never copy/divide a family total or Range into children or sum unlike units as an exchange. Each actual SKU/state/provider/receiver is separate when it represents an independent exchange. A supplied complete package and its already included constituents are exclusive views; identical physical cables serving multiple duties are counted once. Missing actual child roster, quantity, activation/absence, identity/state/medium, method or unit support blocks final foreground completion; it is never zero or implicitly not applicable. Foreground records provide the operands; they cannot choose another reference denominator, allocation, stock or fate convention. actual_<row_id>_quantity aliases this record independent physical quantity keyed by atomic_flow_row_id under the original CP method and atomic_child_normalization, never another parent quantity. Actual child records retain legacy_parent_role and own_node_helper_id; independently collect every original role helper operand in child_quantity_operands, grouped by quantity_ledger_group_key material/source-state/current-state/period/unit. Real internal source and recipient match by paired_atomic_row_id and actual_transfer_event_id, never derived from a parent total or unexplained residual. Internal I=F is a reconciliation condition for the same actual material/SKU, state, event, custody boundary and gate, never an assignment formula. Each child retains its own actual dispatch quantity and receipt/custody evidence. The same signed custody measurement may be traceably reused without inventing another weighing. Never copy a family total into each child, overwrite a real receipt or force unknown quantities equal. Preserve discrepancies with original values/units, measurement uncertainty, actual transfer loss, state change and responsible-owner evidence; unresolved differences block completion. Internal quantities remain unnormalized physical amounts, divided by the original reference denominator only at each card final step; parent-role sums are QA only. | kg; MJ | Every batch, transfer and cleanup; acceptance once per lot | Full work lot including rejected work and rework | One declared interior job site | per reference flow | Calibrations; signed area sheet; supplier instructions; stock/transfer reconciliation; invoices; waste receipts; emission measurements where applicable |

Pair transfers and record inactive exchanges explicitly; obtain A from signed grout_finish acceptance for the same lot. Record actual powder_issued, mixing_water and additive_issued with batch grade/recipe, opening/closing wetstock and paste handoff mass. Keep the mixing pool and wash-water pool separately, measure slurry solids/moisture and actual material carried into washing; retain crystallization-water basis and unknown fate as a balance gap rather than an assumed emission.

| `service_child_range_and_overlap` | shared_access_service; shared_tool_service | New service children have no inherited numeric Range. Retain independent quantities, actual identity/capacity, contract/hour conversion, uncertainty and independently reviewed comparable observations. Add a child interval only with evidence for that specific service; no default hours, arbitrary parent split or same-batch self-validation. A compatible per-hour upstream service already carrying lifetime capital/maintenance burdens must not receive those burdens again or a second lifetime-share multiplier. For actual separately owned assets retain the evidenced original attribution method and one burden owner. Keep operating electricity at its actual node; if it is in a provider package, subtract/reconcile the evidenced included component or use a compatible nonoverlapping service dataset before counting it separately. If inseparable overlap cannot be resolved, block finalization instead of inventing a deduction. | independent quantity/contract/support and component-boundary evidence |

## 9. Validation Rules

| rule_id | Applies to | Rule | source_ids |
| --- | --- | --- | --- |
| area_gate | accepted_tiled_floor | Require A > 0 and one accepted output. Rejected, unfinished and intermediate areas are excluded from A and final sales output. |  |
