# Conventional wired fire-alarm system installation services

## 1. Scope and Applicability

This PCR covers installing and commissioning one conventional wired building fire-alarm system with one control panel, separate detector/manual initiation and notification circuits, and its permanent standby battery pair. Work starts from an accepted design, mounting positions/routes and an existing dedicated isolated mains interface. The installer receives materials, prepares and mounts the panel/devices, routes and terminates wiring, connects and configures the system, corrects defects, completes the actual test schedule and hands over the documented accepted system. The CFP Standard manual is route evidence, not a substitute for the applicable project design or competent acceptance decision (`ctec-standard`, PDF pages 6–8, 10–13, 15, 17 and 23).

Addressable, wireless, two-wire AlarmSense, repeater/network systems, extinguishant control, remote monitoring, upstream building/power provision and post-handover operation/maintenance are excluded. Different panel, zone, device, cable or standby configurations are not automatically functionally equivalent. Installing a component, energising a circuit or recording an inspection is not itself an accepted complete output.

## 5. System Boundary

### Boundary Abstraction

| Field | Value |
| --- | --- |
| declared_starting_condition | Accepted conventional design and routes/mounting interfaces; prepared building and major trays; existing dedicated isolated mains supply at an explicitly located interface; supplied components at installer receipt |
| starting_condition_role | Boundary readiness facts and existing interfaces, not a newly produced exchange or credit |
| product_classification_scope | The conventional wired single-panel installation/commissioning subset of CPC 3.0 54612 |
| recursive_input_rule | If same-category prior installation enters the job, identify its actual handed-over state and upstream package; do not recursively recreate the accepted service or imply that readiness is a service input. A changed scope requires separate review. |
| upstream_dataset_requirement | Match actual supplied component/SKU/state and geography/technology; require upstream manufacture and landed delivery/packaging disclosure. Separate supply manufacture from foreground installation and prevent duplicated embedded packaging. |
| disclosure | Actual design, starting interfaces, installer feeder responsibility, site/job period, supply datasets and inclusions, accepted configuration/D, resource ownership and unclosed evidence gaps |

### Boundary Rules

| `scope_eligibility` | foreground_system_boundary | This PCR covers installing and commissioning one conventional wired building fire-alarm system with one control panel, separate detector/manual initiation and notification circuits, and its permanent standby battery pair. Work starts from an accepted design, mounting positions/routes and an existing dedicated isolated mains interface. The installer receives materials, prepares and mounts the panel/devices, routes and terminates wiring, connects and configures the system, corrects defects, completes the actual test schedule and hands over the documented accepted system.

Addressable, wireless, two-wire AlarmSense, repeater/network systems, extinguishant control, remote monitoring, upstream building/power provision and post-handover operation/maintenance are excluded. Different panel, zone, device, cable or standby configurations are not automatically functionally equivalent. Installing a component, energising a circuit or recording an inspection is not itself an accepted complete output. | `ctec-standard` |
| boundary_install | install_accept | One node owns receipt, preparation/mounting, detector and sounder circuit termination, permanent battery connection, configuration, actual tests/corrections and signed acceptance. Phase journals do not create new product exchanges. Keep compatible EOL, mains segregation and screen/earth interfaces in the actual design record. | `ctec-standard` |
| boundary_mains | `alarm_cable_alarm_circuit`; `alarm_cable_panel_feeder`; installation_electricity | Existing dedicated isolated mains provision is an explicit starting interface. Include the actual installer-supplied feeder segment, connection and pre-handover metered use; exclude upstream building distribution works and later operation. | `ctec-standard` |
| boundary_components | control_panel; smoke_detector; heat_detector; detector_base; manual_call_point; polarised_sounder; end_of_line_device; standby_batteries | Permanent panel power supply/charger, batteries and connected devices are installed product components. They are not reusable tool capital. Disclose accessory inclusions and the actual CFP approval/design battery condition rather than generalising it across models. | `ctec-standard` |
| boundary_residuals | install_accept | Own every actual reject, correction, usable return and residual exit once. Link original issue/event/transfer and actual receiver. Internal retermination or configuration has no fictitious intermediate output; unclassified missing mass is a gap. | |
| boundary_resources | `owned_equipment_attribution_drill`; `owned_equipment_attribution_tester`; `owned_equipment_attribution_external_charger`; `hired_support_service_access` | Identify each shared asset: operator-owned tool/tester/external charger/access equipment and provider-owned services used across jobs/periods. Index every benefiting job and period, from manufacture/acquisition through service, maintenance/replacement to retirement/termination. Preserve actual remaining-use uncertainty. Do not repeat provider asset manufacture. |  |
| boundary_packaging | actual exchanges required by `refine_incoming_packaging`; actual exchanges required by `refine_dry_material_waste` | Keep received packaging in a physical source pool even where its manufacture is embedded in landed supply. Add a separate packaging burden only if excluded upstream; never invent a receipt from its outgoing waste. |  |

## 6. Process Inventory Structure

### Process Map

| process_id | process_name | inclusion | inclusion_condition | role | quantitative_reference |
| --- | --- | --- | --- | --- | --- |
| install_accept | Conventional wired system installation and acceptance | required | Actual accepted-design conventional wired job | One accountable assembly, test/correction and handover responsibility | accepted_installation; 1 Item(s) |

Receiving/readiness, cabling/mounting, connection/configuration, testing/correction and closeout are journal phases of install_accept. A failed panel/device, damaged cable or defective battery remains linked to its correction/replacement and final accepted job. Actual repair, unchanged-stock return, recovery receiver and discard are distinct paths; neither disposal nor recovery is presumed.

##### Elementary flows

## 7. Allocation and Co-product Handling

| rule_id | Applies to | Rule | source_ids |
| --- | --- | --- | --- |
| allocate_job | install_accept | Attribute actual material, electricity, test agent, service and correction burdens to the same accepted configuration/job. Subdivide independently recorded jobs before using a justified causal share. Rejects, repeated tests and failed work do not increase D or escape the job burden. The sole intended product output is accepted_installation; unchanged usable stock is a return rather than an intended co-product. | |
| allocate_returns | actual exchanges required by `refine_unused_product_return`; actual exchanges required by `refine_incoming_packaging` | Preserve gross custody entry and actual unchanged return separately. The upstream consumed-supply numerator is gross issues less evidenced usable returns and remaining stock attributable elsewhere. Return handling/resources remain with this job; do not both net supply and grant a second avoided-product credit. Packaging already embedded in supply has no second manufacture burden. |  |
| allocate_asset | `owned_equipment_attribution_drill`; `owned_equipment_attribution_tester`; `owned_equipment_attribution_external_charger` | For each exact asset manufacture packet use its count times actual job service activity divided by documented same-basis total lifetime activity. Enumerate install_accept and every other consuming job/period; shares reconcile to one over the declared life. Unknown service-life or remaining-use evidence blocks finalized attribution. No whole asset per job, default life or reuse count is allowed. |  |
| allocate_period | `owned_equipment_attribution_drill`; `owned_equipment_attribution_tester`; `owned_equipment_attribution_external_charger` | Use one asset/phase/period index for manufacture/acquisition, all service jobs, maintenance/replacement and retirement/termination. Assign actual maintenance/replacement packets to evidenced benefiting periods or their causal job, with this specific assignment taking precedence over a general lifetime share. Index retirement once and disclose its burden owner. Closed assets use actual history; an in-service remaining-use estimate needs evidence and uncertainty. Do not annualize an already lifetime-attributed packet or count an original and replacement as simultaneous whole inputs. |  |
| allocate_service | `hired_support_service_access`; installation_electricity | Provider service owns its included rented asset manufacture/maintenance and operating resources. Use actual completed-event shares among all consumers and disclose inclusions; only add electricity or other resources outside that service packet. Owned-asset embodied shares and metered electricity are different packets, each counted once. |  |
| allocate_residual | actual exchanges required by `refine_dry_material_waste`; `rejected_component_waste_panel`; `rejected_component_waste_detector`; `rejected_component_waste_heat_detector`; `rejected_component_waste_base`; `rejected_component_waste_call_point`; `rejected_component_waste_sounder`; `rejected_component_waste_eol`; `rejected_component_waste_cable`; `rejected_component_waste_vrla_battery`; `contaminated_solid_waste_wipe`; `contaminated_solid_waste_container`; `contaminated_solid_waste_loose_residue` | Declare actual repair, stock return, recycling/recovery receiver or discard for each state; retain collection and any modelled treatment with its disclosed owner. Destination alone grants no automatic recovery/substitution credit. A downstream recovered-product model requires its own evidence and boundary. |  |

## 8. Foreground Data Collection, Calculation, and Quality Rules


Identify each actual detection, initiation, notification, base and termination SKU separately against the accepted circuit BOM. Conditional cards do not prescribe a device count or universal detector technology. An actual combined factory device is one supplied assembly, with included components excluded from additional purchases. Retain all replacements consumed in correction and exact SKU-specific count-to-mass evidence; any additional actual device still requires its own concrete identity.

### Variable and Physical Ledger Definitions

D is the positive count of complete accepted same-configuration systems in cp_acceptance. Q denotes an actual attributable numerator in its own unit; it never denotes a mixed sum of material, energy, asset fractions and service events. Preserve raw gross observations before burden normalization. For each compatible SKU/material pool, reconcile opening stock plus actual receipts/withdrawals with closing stock, installed retained material, unchanged returns and separately measured residual exits. The accepted service output is counted in Item(s), not included as a kg term. Track actual preparation substrate where relevant to dust without inventing new material consumption.

For formulation constituents, use measured consumed formulation and exact composition on a compatible basis, then reconcile retained, captured/residual and independently evidenced emitted fractions. A carbon or water constraint can test only a compatible actual constituent pool; no generic water balance, oxygen exchange or residual-as-emission shortcut is applicable. Unknown occurrence is an evidence gap, not zero. Keep inventory diagnostics separate from actual concrete exchanges; a heterogeneous mass total is not a selectable flow identity.

### Data Collection Protocols

| protocol_id | process_id | flow_role | record_type | raw_fields | collection_method | unit | frequency | temporal_coverage | site_scope | aggregation_rule | quality_evidence |
| --- | --- | --- | --- | --- | --- | --- | --- | --- | --- | --- | --- |

Count only final signed accepted same-configuration systems; keep held/failed/progress records separately. | Item(s) | each system and correction; final closeout | actual installation start through signed acceptance | one declared site/job and configuration | per reference flow | signed design/BOM/test/restoration record; denominator reconciliation |
| cp_materials | install_accept | physical supplied materials, packaging and usable returns | receipt/issue/return and installed-state ledger | job/date/event/transfer IDs; supplier/SKU/state; gross/net/tare; count or length; matching kg/item or kg/m evidence; shipment/pack material; upstream inclusions; stock; retained installed mass; usable return; concrete_exchange_id; physical_event_id; actual_identity_id; actual_state; receiver_or_provider_gate; native_quantity; native_unit; unique_property; measurement_method_id; uncertainty | Weigh net materials with calibrated scales or use traceable same-SKU count/length mass factors. Trace gross custody inputs, actual unchanged returns, stock change and installed state separately; retain packaging physical pool independent of upstream burden owner.

Further actual identities not fully specified by the conditional children require mandatory refinement and prevent dataset completion; this requirement is not itself a flow exchange. Actual substance, disjoint particle-size fraction and air/water/soil receiving compartment; matched measurement or species/activity factor, whole-fluid composition/fate audit, capture and uncertainty; unknown is not zero. | `cp_residuals`; actual independent records and identity/unit evidence |
| `refine_test_agent_constituent_to_air` | actual independently refined exchanges | Preserve this actual collection and closure scope as a mandatory dataset-production requirement: For actual physically consumed test agent, identify each substance and receiving subcompartment before defining an elementary exchange. Use species monitoring or a product-specific SDS composition and evidenced delivered/captured/residual partition method under solvent_partition. Keep constituent quantities compatible with the consumed formulation pool. Neither device-test count, an undifferentiated VOC label nor a 100% release assumption establishes substance mass or destination. Quantity calculation is specified in section 8 solvent_partition. Range evidence need: exact product/SDS, constituent composition and delivered/captured/residual fractions are required. No generic aerosol/VOC interval or air subcompartment is inferred. Independently establish every actual identity, state, real provider/receiver and exactly one exchange property/unit before constructing its flow card. Each actual exchange requires its own recorded quantity and applicable method, uncertainty and custody/fate coverage. Auxiliary CP units do not authorize extra exchange views. Actual occurrence unknown is not zero; never invent a material/species/provider list or split a parent total. Quantitative screening evidence must fit each actual exchange; a former family interval cannot be copied or divided into child ranges. Further actual identities not fully specified by the conditional children require mandatory refinement and prevent dataset completion; this requirement is not itself a flow exchange. Actual substance, disjoint particle-size fraction and air/water/soil receiving compartment; matched measurement or species/activity factor, whole-fluid composition/fate audit, capture and uncertainty; unknown is not zero. | `cp_residuals`; actual independent records and identity/unit evidence |
| `atomic_exchange_identity_unit` | all inventory rows | Each concrete flow card identifies exactly one actual independently supplied product/SKU/formulation, complete assembly, complete single-function or genuine complete bounded provider service, actual waste composite/state/receiver, or substance/size/receiving medium, with exactly one property and unit. Different actual identities require independent quantities and records, not a summed family exchange. A complete product/carrier includes its contents once. Same unchanged SKU/state usable supply/return pairs and matched physical internal send/receive pairs use the same selected property/unit; kg and count or MJ and kWh auxiliaries are nonadditive measurements, never duplicate exchanges. Missing identity/occurrence/quantity/native reference is a gap, not zero. Any pooled denominator must retain the original accepted configuration strata, state/gate and causal attribution; do not divide unlike circuits, routes, products or jobs as if they were equivalent. | actual identity, unit, custody and independent quantity evidence |
| `asset_final_normalization_once` | all inventory rows | An asset-equivalent formula already ending in division by N, D or A is the final quantity per reference flow. Its complete-life fraction and accepted-output normalization constitute the same normalization operation as the general normalization rule; never divide it by that denominator again. Apply the complete-life upstream burden exactly once. Actual complete provider event counts remain event quantities, not owned-asset fractions. | actual identity, unit, custody and independent quantity evidence |

## 9. Validation Rules

| rule_id | Applies to | Rule | source_ids |
| --- | --- | --- | --- |
| validate_gate | accepted_installation | Require all reference qualifiers, positive D and signed complete acceptance. Confirm actual initiation/notification and cause/effect, fault/mains-failure/standby and final restored-normal-state records against the project acceptance schedule. A programmed test mode or a component check is not whole-system acceptance. | `ctec-standard` |
| validate_identity | all inventory rows | Before a downstream exchange is finalized, verify each actual SKU/material/state/recipient or species/air-compartment identity and compatible property/unit. Conditional umbrellas expand to zero, one or multiple concrete exchanges according to actual occurrence; unknown is not zero. Count support does not verify a service UUID. | |
| validate_quantity | all inventory rows | Match each raw numerator, unit, CP, applicable section 8 calculation and common D. Check separate gross/return/stock/retained/residual pools; reject mixed-material UUIDs, mass conversion of electricity and event conversion of hourly rent. Missing compatible Energy or Duration support remains an explicit gap. | |
| validate_rework | `rejected_component_waste_panel`; `rejected_component_waste_detector`; `rejected_component_waste_heat_detector`; `rejected_component_waste_base`; `rejected_component_waste_call_point`; `rejected_component_waste_sounder`; `rejected_component_waste_eol`; `rejected_component_waste_cable`; `rejected_component_waste_vrla_battery`; accepted_installation | Link original component/cable/battery defect, repair/replacement, repeat test and actual exit to install_accept. Keep failed/held work out of D while retaining its burdens. Every exit has actual state and receiver; no undocumented recovery path or credit. |  |
| validate_shared_period | `owned_equipment_attribution_drill`; `owned_equipment_attribution_tester`; `owned_equipment_attribution_external_charger`; `hired_support_service_access` | Reconcile all resource consumers and periods, actual service-life shares and manufacture/maintenance/replacement/retirement event ownership. Missing remaining-use/replacement/termination evidence blocks finalized attribution. Prevent whole-tool defaults, repeated lifetime/annual allocation and duplicates across provider service, owned assets and electricity. |  |
| validate_ranges | all inventory rows | Preserve each role-specific range evidence need in section 8. A manufacturer design limit, nominal factor or exact 1 Item(s) reference is not an empirical quantity interval.
