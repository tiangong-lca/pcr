# Existing Commercial Office Space Category A Base-Building Services and Finishes Integrated Refurbishment Services

## 1. Scope and Applicability

This PCR covers a completed integrated landlord Category A refurbishment within a surveyed retained commercial office space. Its product is an actual contract-defined base-building services and basic-finishes state ready for later tenant fit-out. The landlord acceptance gate coordinates retained conditions, physical installations and required testing; it is not an assertion that every typical Cat A component is present or that a tenant can occupy an operational Cat B workplace. [wdi-cat-a-b-fitout]

## 2. Product Category Identity

| Field | Value |
| --- | --- |
| canonical_pcr_id | pcr.constructions-and-construction-services.construction-services.general-construction-services-of-commercial-buildings |
| classification_refs | cpc:3.0:54122 (narrower) |
| covered_products | Integrated retained-office Cat A landlord refurbishment under actual contract scope. |
| excluded_products | New buildings; extensions/new floor area; structural rebuilding; change of use; tenant Cat B; future operation. |
| representative_product | Accepted retained office-space base-building services and basic finishes at landlord handover. |
| production_route | Survey/isolate → selective stripout and substrate release → coordinated Cat A installation → testing/retesting and defect-closed landlord handover. |
| market_state | Completed construction/refurbishment service, not an at-plant material package or occupied tenant office. |

## 3. Reference Flow

| Field | Value |
| --- | --- |
| What | Landlord-accepted integrated Cat A office refurbishment within the declared retained footprint. |
| How much | 1 m2 |
| How well | Actual contracted interface/system schedule and required tests, records and defect closure accepted by landlord. |
| How long or cycle | One actual intervention from prework survey through sectional/final acceptance, with phase/period IDs; no assumed service life. |
| reference_flow_link | `accepted_cat_a_office` |

| Field | Value |
| --- | --- |
| reference_amount | 1 |
| product_flow | Completed landlord-accepted Cat A office refurbishment service |
| flow_property | Area `93a60a56-a3c8-19da-a746-0800200c9a66` |
| unit_group | Units of area `93a60a57-a3c8-18da-a746-0800200c9a66` |
| reference_unit | m2 |
| required_qualifiers | building_id; footprint_polygons; survey_convention; retained_replaced_schedule; occupancy_phasing; contract_cat_a_scope; base_services_interface_points; common_core_attribution; test_criteria; defect_closed_landlord_acceptance |

A is the unique accepted net internal office floor area. Keep associated common cores and external/shared system burdens causally attributed once; include their area in A only when the same declared survey convention explicitly includes it once. Never add floor, ceiling and trade areas. Multiple zones/buildings are not automatically comparable.

## 4. Measurement and Unit Rules

| rule_id | Applies to | Required property | Required unit | Rule |
| --- | --- | --- | --- | --- |
| `reference_area` | accepted_cat_a_office | Area `93a60a56-a3c8-19da-a746-0800200c9a66` | m2 | A>0 is unique surveyed accepted net internal office area under the declared convention; count accepted polygons once after coordinated gate closure. Associated cores/external systems enter causal burdens, not free exclusions or extra denominator area. |
| `native_units` | all inventory rows | Actual native property | actual native unit | Preserve supplied Area, Count, Length, Volume, Mass and service units. A separate needed mass view requires actual SKU density, state, moisture and temperature with units/source; it is nonadditive to the native ledger. Energy/Time and provider-native support require independent verification. |

## 5. System Boundary

### Boundary Abstraction

| Field | Value |
| --- | --- |
| declared_starting_condition | Surveyed retained office footprint with actual substrates, existing services/capacity, occupancy and approved scope. |
| starting_condition_role | Retained context and intervention starting state, not a purchased new building. |
| product_classification_scope | Commercial-office repair/alteration subset of CPC 54122. |
| recursive_input_rule | Treat same-category completed subcontract work as upstream only with distinct physical scope/native result and complete burden coverage; exclude duplicated direct resources and internal office-state transfers. |
| upstream_dataset_requirement | Actual SKU/provider/geography/technology/native-unit datasets with explicit supply, freight, asset and waste coverage; expand gaps before finalization. |
| disclosure | Retained/replaced conditions, common/core causal scope, occupancy/phases, contract interfaces, test gates, covered upstream resources and exclusions. |

### Process: Survey, isolate and selectively strip out (`stripout`)

#### Inputs

##### Product flows

###### Removal collection bag (`stripout_consumables_bag`)

One independently identified removal collection bag. This is a conditional independent object supported within the original stripout_consumables scope; activate only when actually independently supplied, used or dispatched. Keep actual SKU, material/formulation, specification, state and provider or receiver. Preserve complete supplied products, formulations, assemblies, bounded services and actual mixed-waste carriers as whole views; do not add their already included constituents. Usable outward exits match the original input property/unit and require actual custody transfer; closing stock is not an exit and usable original-state items are not waste. Waste retains its producing node, actual contamination/state, receiver and treatment boundary and is not an environmental emission. The same physical cable or SKU serving several duties is counted once, with duty observations nonadditive. Evidence is required for nonoccurrence; this card assumes no occurrence, composition, count or loss factor.

Original role-specific boundary and operating constraints apply only to this independent child; the former family/screen text is neither another exchange nor an inherited Range: Actual bags, barriers, protection, cutting and cleaning consumables used to release the retained substrate; split by actual product and hazard role. Historic fittings are retained context, not new material receipts. Actual removed fit-for-reuse historical equipment or fittings MUST be instantiated as separate historical Product outlets in actual Count/Area/Length/Volume/Mass units, recording origin, usable state, native quantity/unit, receiver, transfer and unique owner; never default these to waste, current-supply returns or negative new receipts.

- Selected flow: Removal collection bag
- Flow property / unit: Mass / kg
- Amount rule: Independently collect actual_stripout_consumables_bag_quantity in kg. Net weigh this actual object/dispatch, or convert actual count/length with independently evidenced same-SKU/state item or linear mass only when needed; one exchange quantity remains. Apply the original CP opening/receipts/intact-unused closing, installed/consumed, usable exits, waste, processed WIP, real correction and period method without changing its gross/fate convention. Normalize once by the original independently accepted reference denominator A; A=0 blocks accepted-service normalization. Never copy a family total, assumed proportion or parent Range; require independent child measurement, conversion and uncertainty evidence. Original quantity convention with original CP operands: S = opening + net_receipts - closing in this SKU's native unit. Declare one view: gross-with-outlets input S / A, or consumed-only input (S - usable_outward_return) / A. Include all nonreturned loss/waste and failed-work consumption; keep matched physical return evidence without a second deduction or credit.

#### Outputs

##### Product flows

###### Retained office footprint released for Cat A integration (`released_office_state`)

Internal handoff after actual service isolation, selective removals and substrate/hazard clearance; survey polygons and release IDs connect to installation. This does not meet final Cat A acceptance.

- Selected flow: Retained office footprint released for Cat A integration
- Flow property / unit: Area / m2
- Amount rule: Measured released footprint area divided by A; internal activity only, no new purchase or final credit.
- Value mode: Foreground record (`foreground_record`)
- Specificity: Site-specific (`site_specific`)
- Normalization basis: per reference flow
- Basis kind: Reference flow (`reference_flow`)
- Evidence kind: Collected record (`collected_record`)
- Collection protocol: `cp_stripout_release`
- Sources: `wdi-cat-a-b-fitout`; `wdi-riverside-refurbishment`

###### Complete HVAC terminal (`count_components_hvac_terminal`)

One independently identified complete hvac terminal. This is a conditional independent object supported within the original count_components scope; activate only when actually independently supplied, used or dispatched. Keep actual SKU, material/formulation, specification, state and provider or receiver. Preserve complete supplied products, formulations, assemblies, bounded services and actual mixed-waste carriers as whole views; do not add their already included constituents. Usable outward exits match the original input property/unit and require actual custody transfer; closing stock is not an exit and usable original-state items are not waste. Waste retains its producing node, actual contamination/state, receiver and treatment boundary and is not an environmental emission. The same physical cable or SKU serving several duties is counted once, with duty observations nonadditive. Evidence is required for nonoccurrence; this card assumes no occurrence, composition, count or loss factor.

Original role-specific boundary and operating constraints apply only to this independent child; the former family/screen text is neither another exchange nor an inherited Range: Actual specified luminaires, distribution/control equipment, HVAC terminals or plant, wet/fire devices and mounting assemblies according to retained/replaced scope.

###### Cleaning formulation (`mass_consumables_cleaner`)

One independently identified cleaning formulation. This is a conditional independent object supported within the original mass_consumables scope; activate only when actually independently supplied, used or dispatched. Keep actual SKU, material/formulation, specification, state and provider or receiver. Preserve complete supplied products, formulations, assemblies, bounded services and actual mixed-waste carriers as whole views; do not add their already included constituents. Usable outward exits match the original input property/unit and require actual custody transfer; closing stock is not an exit and usable original-state items are not waste. Waste retains its producing node, actual contamination/state, receiver and treatment boundary and is not an environmental emission. The same physical cable or SKU serving several duties is counted once, with duty observations nonadditive. Evidence is required for nonoccurrence; this card assumes no occurrence, composition, count or loss factor.

Original role-specific boundary and operating constraints apply only to this independent child; the former family/screen text is neither another exchange nor an inherited Range: Actual adhesives, basic paints, sealants, fixings and cleaning materials; retain product composition and application state.

###### Usable outward return of complete wet-service device (`integration_usable_returns_wet_device`)

The same actual usable product/SKU as count_components_wet_device. This is a conditional independent object supported within the original integration_usable_returns scope; activate only when actually independently supplied, used or dispatched. Keep actual SKU, material/formulation, specification, state and provider or receiver. Preserve complete supplied products, formulations, assemblies, bounded services and actual mixed-waste carriers as whole views; do not add their already included constituents. Usable outward exits match the original input property/unit and require actual custody transfer; closing stock is not an exit and usable original-state items are not waste. Waste retains its producing node, actual contamination/state, receiver and treatment boundary and is not an environmental emission. The same physical cable or SKU serving several duties is counted once, with duty observations nonadditive. Evidence is required for nonoccurrence; this card assumes no occurrence, composition, count or loss factor.

Original role-specific boundary and operating constraints apply only to this independent child; the former family/screen text is neither another exchange nor an inherited Range: Expand each returned supply by actual Area, Count, Length, Mass or Volume with matching incoming SKU, condition, amount and verified support. Never merge unlike units or treat closing inventory as outward return.

Evidence is required for nonoccurrence; this card assumes no occurrence, composition, count or loss factor.

Original role-specific boundary and operating constraints apply only to this independent child; the former family/screen text is neither another exchange nor an inherited Range: Expand each returned supply by actual Area, Count, Length, Mass or Volume with matching incoming SKU, condition, amount and verified support. Never merge unlike units or treat closing inventory as outward return.

- Selected flow: Usable outward return of purchased test fluid formulation
- Flow property / unit: Volume / m3
- Amount rule: Independently measure actual_integration_usable_returns_test_fluid_quantity in fixed m3; retain actual native measurements, instrument/dimension/count and same-identity/state conversion evidence, leaving one exchange quantity after conversion. Determine this child's physical numerator using the original CP stock, receipts/issues, installed/consumed, rework, usable exit, waste, period and attribution method, then divide once by original reference denominator A; A=0 blocks normalization. Never copy a parent total, assumed proportion, alternate-unit view or family Range. Original quantity convention, with original CP operands: Native-unit matched usable outward returns divided by A, as one nonadditive outlet view under the declared gross or net convention.

###### Reusable access platform asset equivalent (`shared_assets_platform`)

One independently identified reusable access platform asset equivalent. This is a conditional independent object supported within the original shared_assets scope; activate only when actually independently supplied, used or dispatched. Keep actual SKU, material/formulation, specification, state and provider or receiver. Preserve complete supplied products, formulations, assemblies, bounded services and actual mixed-waste carriers as whole views; do not add their already included constituents. Usable outward exits match the original input property/unit and require actual custody transfer; closing stock is not an exit and usable original-state items are not waste. Waste retains its producing node, actual contamination/state, receiver and treatment boundary and is not an environmental emission. The same physical cable or SKU serving several duties is counted once, with duty observations nonadditive. Evidence is required for nonoccurrence; this card assumes no occurrence, composition, count or loss factor.

Original role-specific boundary and operating constraints apply only to this independent child; the former family/screen text is neither another exchange nor an inherited Range: One asset-equivalent view of actual scaffolds/platforms, extraction plant, instruments, distribution assets and durable tools shared by stripout, integration and test_handover across phases. Include manufacture, maintenance, replacements and end of life across all consumers/jobs/periods.

###### Actual inbound, outbound and provider freight service (`freight_services`)

Own actual material, waste, return and equipment logistics not already covered by provider/supply datasets. Record actual load, route, vehicle and empty returns; passenger/provider travel requires a separate native physical service expansion when present.

- Selected flow: Actual inbound, outbound and provider freight service
- Flow property / unit: Mass*distance / kg*km
- Amount rule: Sum actual load_kg * actual distance_km for covered legs divided by A, with actual empty-return service burden and coverage disclosed.

##### Elementary flows

###### Water withdrawn from the declared environmental source (`direct_environmental_water_withdrawal`)

Apply only when this specific exchange actually occurs within the existing work boundary. Record its exact material or device identity, supplied/current state, native quantity and actual recipient or upstream coverage. Do not infer occurrence, quantity, a new process or a UUID. A complete supplied assembly and its already included components are mutually exclusive purchase views. This is an elementary INPUT from the actual water source, never an emission or purchased-water supply. Meter each actual source separately and avoid duplicate supplied-water and recirculated-water entries.

- Selected flow: Water withdrawn from the declared environmental source
- Flow property / unit: Volume / m3
- Amount rule: Actual measured attributable environmental water withdrawal in m3 divided by A once, with the actual source compartment.
- Value mode: `foreground_record`
- Specificity: Site-specific (`site_specific`)
- Normalization basis: per reference flow
- Basis kind: Reference flow (`reference_flow`)
- Evidence kind: `collected_record`
- Collection protocol: `cp_support_environment`

Range evidence need: Determine actual species and receiving medium with measured mass or valid matched activity-factor/whole-fluid composition-fate evidence; independently meter actual environmental water Volume and gas native quantities with their compartments and conversion conditions. Water volume never uses a pollutant species formula; no invented species, SDS emission quantity or missing-as-zero.


#### Outputs

##### Product flows

###### Actual usable liquid fuel returned outward (`fuel_usable_return`)

Record only documented usable fuel sent outside the foreground boundary with grade, state, lot and incoming match. Recovered spill retained at closing is closing stock.

Retain the actual ticket-native unit and conversion operands; the platform volume-group child unit is l, with 1 L = 1 l = 0.001 m3. Uppercase L is not a separately verified platform unit identifier; preserve ticket units and avoid repeated conversion.

- Selected flow: Actual usable liquid fuel returned outward
- Flow property / unit: Volume / l
- Amount rule: Actual matched native-volume outward return / A. Under gross-with-outlets retain this measured outlet; under consumed-only it is a nonadditive physical audit record, already deducted once from supplied_fuel. No extra credit.
- Value mode: Foreground record (`foreground_record`)
- Specificity: Site-specific (`site_specific`)
- Normalization basis: per reference flow
- Basis kind: Reference flow (`reference_flow`)
- Evidence kind: Collected record (`collected_record`)
- Collection protocol: `cp_support_fuel`

Range evidence need: Record actual usable grade/lot/state, measured return in receipt-native units and physical receiver matched to incoming fuel; recovered closing remains closing. No return fraction or additional avoided-supply credit.

##### Waste flows

###### Spent support filter (`support_waste_filter`)

One independently identified spent support filter. This is a conditional independent object supported within the original support_waste scope; activate only when actually independently supplied, used or dispatched. Keep actual SKU, material/formulation, specification, state and provider or receiver. Preserve complete supplied products, formulations, assemblies, bounded services and actual mixed-waste carriers as whole views; do not add their already included constituents. Usable outward exits match the original input property/unit and require actual custody transfer; closing stock is not an exit and usable original-state items are not waste. Waste retains its producing node, actual contamination/state, receiver and treatment boundary and is not an environmental emission. The same physical cable or SKU serving several duties is counted once, with duty observations nonadditive. Evidence is required for nonoccurrence; this card assumes no occurrence, composition, count or loss factor.

Original role-specific boundary and operating constraints apply only to this independent child; the former family/screen text is neither another exchange nor an inherited Range: Collected filters, temporary protection, contained fuel waste and water treatment residues go to actual receiving treatment. Recovered closing fuel and direct uncontrolled releases are separate mutually exclusive fates.

- Selected flow: Spent support filter
- Flow property / unit: Mass / kg
- Amount rule: Independently collect actual_support_waste_filter_quantity in kg. Net weigh this actual object/dispatch, or convert actual count/length with independently evidenced same-SKU/state item or linear mass only when needed; one exchange quantity remains. Apply the original CP opening/receipts/intact-unused closing, installed/consumed, usable exits, waste, processed WIP, real correction and period method without changing its gross/fate convention. Normalize once by the original independently accepted reference denominator A; A=0 blocks accepted-service normalization. Never copy a family total, assumed proportion or parent Range; require independent child measurement, conversion and uncertainty evidence. Original quantity convention with original CP operands: Actual net weighed consignments divided by A; a volume-to-mass view needs actual fuel/SKU density and state and is nonadditive.
- Value mode: `calculated_value`
- Specificity: `site_specific`
- Normalization basis: per reference flow
- Basis kind: `reference_flow`
- Evidence kind: `calculated_from_collection`
- Collection protocol: `cp_support_waste`

###### Water-treatment residue (`support_waste_treatment_residue`)

One independently identified water-treatment residue. This is a conditional independent object supported within the original support_waste scope; activate only when actually independently supplied, used or dispatched. Keep actual SKU, material/formulation, specification, state and provider or receiver. Preserve complete supplied products, formulations, assemblies, bounded services and actual mixed-waste carriers as whole views; do not add their already included constituents.

##### Elementary flows


###### Water discharged to the declared environmental receiving compartment (`direct_water_discharge`)

Apply only when this specific exchange actually occurs within the existing work boundary. Record its exact material or device identity, supplied/current state, native quantity and actual recipient or upstream coverage. Do not infer occurrence, quantity, a new process or a UUID. A complete supplied assembly and its already included components are mutually exclusive purchase views. Record measured actual direct water discharge separately from captured wastewater transferred to treatment. A water-balance gap is not a discharge measurement.

- Selected flow: Water discharged to the declared environmental receiving compartment
- Flow property / unit: Volume / m3
- Amount rule: Actual measured attributed direct water discharge in m3 divided by A once; record source/receiver and no species-mass factor.
- Value mode: `foreground_record`
- Specificity: Site-specific (`site_specific`)
- Normalization basis: per reference flow
- Basis kind: Reference flow (`reference_flow`)

## 7. Allocation and Co-product Handling

| rule_id | Applies to | Rule | source_ids |
| --- | --- | --- | --- |
| `single_output` | final output | One intended output is accepted Cat A service area. Internal state transfers and tested trade surfaces are not co-products; exclude unresolved or failed polygons from A until defect closure. No avoided-burden credit for historic recovered material. |  |
| `stocks_returns` | materials and fuel | S = attributed opening stock + external net tare-corrected receipts - carried closing stock. Internal issues/installed activity are not new purchases. Choose gross-with-outlets OR consumed-only matched usable outward-return netting once; no extra credit. All nonreturned loss/waste retains upstream supply burden. |  |
| `shared_complete_life` | site_support | Identify each shared access/utility/tool/test asset, all consuming nodes stripout/integration/test_handover and all external jobs/nodes/periods over full life. Use compatible actual job_driver / full_life_driver with observed life OR observed history plus evidenced remainder, replacements, termination and end of life; retain sources, uncertainty, sensitivity and update. Asset-equivalent amount=(job_driver/full_life_driver)/A with complete manufacture/maintenance/replacement/EOL burden; alternatively a lifecycle-complete per-driver service quantity=job_driver/A in matching unit, never both. |  |
| `phases_rework` | all nodes | Index survey/isolation, stripout, installation, testing/retesting and signed sectional/final completion by actual phase and period. Failed tests return affected installed state to integration with defect IDs; discarded/replaced items exit via the owning waste row. Retain all failed attempt and replacement burdens with accepted A once, without a second sale, year or area denominator. |  |

## 8. Foreground Data Collection, Calculation, and Quality Rules


Keep elementary resource intakes and environmental releases in opposite directions. Direct environmental water withdrawal is an input; direct water discharge and substance emissions are outputs, each with actual source/receiver and compatible units. Any actual gas-resource intake or gas release still requires its own substance, direction, state, measured quantity and concrete exchange; this collection obligation is not a generic selected gas flow. The existing intervention boundary and no-occurrence/no-invented-quantity rules remain.

### Data Collection Protocols

Retain external net_receipts in quantity_unit and its receipt_basis. Apply stock_throughput to that net native quantity; raw gross_receipts/tare are audit observations with explicit measurement units, not automatic native-unit operands. For a weighed route preserve gross_receipt_mass_kg and tare_mass_kg and any same-SKU/state conversion; for an already net or nonweighed receipt record its net quantity and mark inapplicable weighing fields explicitly, with no second tare deduction. Retain the original PCR stock, event, denominator, attribution and closure methods above. Maintain an actual-child register by node, period and parent_ledger_id. Each quantity-bearing exchange has one independent physical product, complete formulation/assembly, defined bounded service, actual waste carrier or substance/medium, one fixed property/unit and its independently collected numerator. Retain all original roles, corrections and stock/WIP/fate records. Former family quantities remain non-exchange custody or closure diagnostics only; never copy/divide a family total or Range into children or sum unlike units as an exchange. Each actual SKU/state/provider/receiver is separate when it represents an independent exchange. A supplied complete package and its already included constituents are exclusive views; identical physical cables serving multiple duties are counted once. Missing actual child roster, quantity, activation/absence, identity/state/medium, method or unit support blocks final foreground completion; it is never zero or implicitly not applicable. Foreground records provide the operands; they cannot choose another reference denominator, allocation, stock or fate convention. actual_<row_id>_quantity aliases this record independent physical quantity keyed by atomic_flow_row_id under the original CP method and atomic_child_normalization, never another parent quantity. Actual child records retain legacy_parent_role and own_node_helper_id; independently collect every original role helper operand in child_quantity_operands, grouped by quantity_ledger_group_key material/source-state/current-state/period/unit. Real internal source and recipient match by paired_atomic_row_id and actual_transfer_event_id, never derived from a parent total or unexplained residual. Internal I=F is a reconciliation condition for the same actual material/SKU, state, event, custody boundary and gate, never an assignment formula. Each child retains its own actual dispatch quantity and receipt/custody evidence. The same signed custody measurement may be traceably reused without inventing another weighing. Never copy a family total into each child, overwrite a real receipt or force unknown quantities equal.

Document zero only with coverage evidence; no generic VOC, SDS or safety threshold surrogate. Retain the original PCR stock, event, denominator, attribution and closure methods above. Maintain an actual-child register by node, period and parent_ledger_id. Each quantity-bearing exchange has one independent physical product, complete formulation/assembly, defined bounded service, actual waste carrier or substance/medium, one fixed property/unit and its independently collected numerator. Retain all original roles, corrections and stock/WIP/fate records. Former family quantities remain non-exchange custody or closure diagnostics only; never copy/divide a family total or Range into children or sum unlike units as an exchange. Each actual SKU/state/provider/receiver is separate when it represents an independent exchange. A supplied complete package and its already included constituents are exclusive views; identical physical cables serving multiple duties are counted once. Missing actual child roster, quantity, activation/absence, identity/state/medium, method or unit support blocks final foreground completion; it is never zero or implicitly not applicable. Foreground records provide the operands; they cannot choose another reference denominator, allocation, stock or fate convention. actual_<row_id>_quantity aliases this record independent physical quantity keyed by atomic_flow_row_id under the original CP method and atomic_child_normalization, never another parent quantity. Actual child records retain legacy_parent_role and own_node_helper_id; independently collect every original role helper operand in child_quantity_operands, grouped by quantity_ledger_group_key material/source-state/current-state/period/unit. Real internal source and recipient match by paired_atomic_row_id and actual_transfer_event_id, never derived from a parent total or unexplained residual. Internal I=F is a reconciliation condition for the same actual material/SKU, state, event, custody boundary and gate, never an assignment formula. Each child retains its own actual dispatch quantity and receipt/custody evidence. The same signed custody measurement may be traceably reused without inventing another weighing. Never copy a family total into each child, overwrite a real receipt or force unknown quantities equal. Preserve discrepancies with original values/units, measurement uncertainty, actual transfer loss, state change and responsible-owner evidence; unresolved differences block completion.

### Calculation Rules

The algebra below defines foreground accounting protocols using actual raw records and unit definitions. WDI supports the Cat A practice boundary and phased handoff only; it supplies no stock, combustion, species or full-life mathematical factor.

| rule_id | Applies to | Formula or rule | Inputs | Output | source_ids |
| --- | --- | --- | --- | --- | --- |
| `area_normalization` | all inventory rows | Q_norm = Q_attributed / A; A is the unique accepted net internal office area, with A>0; normalize each attributed physical ledger once. | Q_attributed; A; cp_handover | Physical native-unit amount per reference flow |  |
| `stock_throughput` | stripout_consumables_bag; stripout_consumables_barrier; stripout_consumables_protection; stripout_consumables_cutting; stripout_consumables_cleaning; atomic_stripout_consumables; area_components_raised_floor_panel; area_components_ceiling_board; area_components_ceiling_grid; area_components_basic_covering; atomic_area_components; count_components_luminaire; count_components_distribution_equipment; count_components_control_equipment; count_components_hvac_terminal; count_components_hvac_plant; count_components_wet_device; count_components_fire_device; count_components_mounting_assembly; atomic_count_components; length_components_cable; length_components_pipe; length_components_duct; length_components_containment; atomic_length_components; mass_consumables_adhesive; mass_consumables_paint; mass_consumables_sealant; mass_consumables_fixing; mass_consumables_cleaner; atomic_mass_consumables; volume_fluids_hydronic_fluid; volume_fluids_test_fluid; volume_fluids_water; atomic_volume_fluids; test_consumables_tracer; test_consumables_cleaner; test_consumables_test_article; atomic_test_consumables; supplied_fuel | S = opening + net_receipts - closing; choose gross-with-outlets OR consumed-only S - usable_outward_return once; retain nonreturned waste/loss upstream.  opening, net_receipts, closing and usable_outward_return must all use this same SKU/state native quantity_unit. net_receipts is the externally received quantity after any actual packaging/tare correction, exactly once: use a directly recorded net native receipt for count/area/length/volume routes; only for actual weighing first calculate net_mass_kg = gross_receipt_mass_kg - tare_mass_kg in kg, then apply an evidenced same-SKU/state conversion if the stock unit is not kg. Never subtract kg tare from m2, Item(s), m or l, and never deduct tare again from an already net receipt. Record receipt_basis and unit/conversion evidence; missing required conversion prevents finalization, while a nonweighing route marks mass/tare fields not applicable rather than fabricating zero. | opening; net_receipts; closing; usable_outward_return; receipt_basis; gross_receipt_mass_kg; tare_mass_kg; conversion_factor; conversion_unit; conversion_source | Declared native-unit supply throughput |  |

| `freight_activity` | freight_services | Freight = sum(load_kg * distance_km) / A; include actual empty-return coverage through its evidenced service burden, without inventing loaded mass. | load; load_unit; distance; distance_unit; empty_return; A; cp_support_freight | Actual kg*km per reference flow and disclosed empty-return coverage |  |
| `release_activity` | atomic_actual_species_releases | Release_mass = measured_mass OR activity * species_factor OR whole_fluid_release * composition * fate_fraction; applies only to actual species mass on one complete compatible basis. Direct environmental water uses Water_volume = measured_water_volume, and gas uses separate measured_gas_quantity with actual unit/state/compartment; water Volume never uses a species-mass formula. | measured_mass; measured_water_volume; measured_gas_quantity; activity; species_factor; whole_fluid_release; composition; fate_fraction; cp_support_environment | Actual species/medium release or direct water/gas quantity before one division by A |  |
| `direct_water_measurement` | direct_environmental_water_withdrawal; direct_water_discharge | For each actual source or receiver, quantity = measured attributed water volume in m3 / A once. Environmental withdrawal is an input; direct discharge is an output. Do not net the two, infer discharge from missing balance, apply a species-mass factor, or count purchased/captured-treatment water again. | measured_water_volume; source_compartment; receiving_compartment; direction; A; cp_support_environment | Separate actual water input/output in m3 per reference flow |  |

Materials retain original CP per-identity/state gross/net stock and outward-return conventions; transfers use actual paired custody quantity; usable exits and wastes use independent actual fate quantities. Owned assets use this PCR original job_driver/full_life_driver complete-life asset-equivalent method including manufacture, maintenance, replacement and end of life, with complete every-consumer positive denominator. Purchased services use only actual complete physical tasks whose real contract defines Item(s), with original actual attribution; hours, days and prices cannot become event counts. atomic_child_intensity = independent_physical_quantity / A, where A is unique surveyed accepted net internal Cat A office area in m2 under the original acceptance rule; A=0 blocks normalization. Non-exchange parent role ledgers and original CP operands retain their stock, transfer, closure and ownership functions, without adding a second exchange or changing the method. | atomic_flow_row_id; independent_physical_quantity; exchange_property; exchange_unit; A; cp_stripout_material; cp_integration_material; cp_test_material; cp_support_provider; cp_support_assets; cp_support_waste; cp_support_environment | atomic_child_intensity |  |

This output contains no environmental resource withdrawal and no whole-water volume. Preserve measured-mass, complete species-factor or composition/fate alternatives without duplicate factors. Named children cover only the listed conditional objects; every other real independent object remains required in the actual register. At this node use the original CP to collect each object's identity/state/medium or receiver, one fixed property/unit, independent quantity/conversion, activation or evidenced absence, source-ledger event, ownership and upstream coverage. The PCR denominator, stock/fate, allocation and closure methods remain unchanged; foreground records cannot choose a different method. Parent totals are non-exchange diagnostics, never copied to children or summed across unlike units as an exchange; do not duplicate a complete formulation/assembly/actual mixed carrier as constituents. Incomplete actual roster, quantity, identity/support, method or coverage blocks final foreground completion, never zero, implicit nonapplicability or manifest-only disclosure. | cp_support_environment; actual_child_register; parent_ledger_id |
| atomic_legacy_role_mapping | stripout; integration; test_handover; site_support | Legacy roles are non-exchange stock, activity, fate or closure keys in the original CP. Independent child exchanges carry quantities; atomic_ requirements retain mandatory remaining-roster refinement and finalization blocks. Original raw fields, helpers and native-unit operands retain their responsibilities and reconcile by child identity and compatible unit, never adding parent totals or unlike units.

| atomic_child_routing | stripout; integration; test_handover; site_support | The following routes each child to its original role, node, unique unit and method CP. Independently apply that original role measurement, stock, source/fate, rework, share, conversion and normalization method to each actual identity/state child. Retain the original helper/selector role parameter as legacy_parent_role, but supply quantity operands from this child independent records; ROW_UNIT(child_row_id) is the explicit unit below. Reconcile stocks/transfers only within the same identity/state and compatible native unit, grouping different materials, media, states and units separately. Parent totals are non-exchange diagnostics, never copied as child operands or summed across unlike units. Unsupported original-helper applicability or missing actual conversion, denominator or evidence blocks finalization; field records cannot choose a new method. Original role-named formula operands remain ledger names rather than duplicate exchanges. A cross-unit legacy role executes by this mapping and actual child unit instead of inheriting a wrong fixed unit.

## 9. Validation Rules

| rule_id | Applies to | Rule | source_ids |
| --- | --- | --- | --- |
| `gate_area` | reference and handover | Require surveyed convention/polygons and A>0, no overlaps or premature partial area, actual contract system schedule and all applicable electrical/HVAC balancing/control/wet/fire tests, retests, record drawings/O&M, defect closure and landlord signoff. Actual approval requirements remain project-specific; Cat A alone proves none. | `wdi-cat-a-b-fitout`; `wdi-riverside-refurbishment` |
| `balance_native` | all inventory rows | Reconcile native supply, matched returns, contained wastes, installed stocks and direct releases by event/SKU. Reconcile opening, external receipts and closing balances; recovered fuel retained at the boundary is already included in closing, never an additional fate. Outward return, nonburned waste, uncontained loss and closing are disjoint destinations. Historic assets cannot offset new supply; no duplicate kit/BOM, provider/direct or freight coverage. |  |
| `fuel_species` | site_support | Actual burn uses measured burn OR an audited complete set of disjoint native-unit fates with uncertainty and unknown-loss investigation. Return, nonburned waste, uncontained loss and carry are mutually exclusive; no residual inferred burn. Total spill is audit only and recovered closing is already closing. Require actual species/medium and measured mass, matched activity-factor or measured whole-fluid composition/fate basis; whole-fluid and species views are nonadditive, SDS/no-VOC claims are not quantities. |  |
| `shared_rework` | all nodes | Check full-life consumers/periods, compatible drivers, replacements/termination/EOL and one burden view; unknown full-life coverage blocks finalization. Match transfer/defect IDs and waste destinations; no rejected state in accepted A. Required actual direct water/gas roles must be expanded with dedicated measured exchanges and CP operands before final data. |  |
| `identity_coverage` | all inventory rows | Expand every actual SKU/provider/waste/species umbrella into verified concrete exchanges with native property/unit support. Unresolved identities or omitted physical provider, temporary/test/spare/transport resources block final data; a candidate check is not publication or UUID verification. |  |

Traceable reuse of the same signed measurement is allowed; copied parent totals, overwritten receipts and forced unknown equality are prohibited. Unexplained differences without uncertainty, actual loss or state-transition responsibility evidence block completion; verify exactly one normalization per card. |  |
