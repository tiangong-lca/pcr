# Rotary-installed ungrouted steel helical foundation installation services

## 1. Scope and Applicability

This PCR covers first installation of an engineered ungrouted steel helical foundation for new construction by rotary insertion with thrust subordinate to rotation, bolted lead/extension assembly and approved separately supplied steel load-transfer caps/adapters. It ends at the accepted foundation-to-superstructure steel interface ready to receive the separately owned structure. Actual project design, qualified installation, utilities clearance, termination and required testing govern. [chance-helical-installation-2017]

Exclude impact, vibratory or push installation; grouted screw-displacement piles and micropiles; ground-anchor tiebacks; underpinning or jacking an existing structure; concrete footings, grade beams and excavation contracts; factory pile manufacture; the subsequent superstructure and operation. New enabling access or interface work attributable to the installation must be included with an explicit owner or recorded as an unresolved route-fit gap. Substantial excavation/concrete or incompatible site remediation requires a separately governed package, not silent omission. CPC 54512 is broader than this rotary route. [un-cpc3-2025]

### Boundary Rules

It ends at the accepted foundation-to-superstructure steel interface ready to receive the separately owned structure. Actual project design, qualified installation, utilities clearance, termination and required testing govern. [chance-helical-installation-2017] Exclude impact, vibratory or push installation; grouted screw-displacement piles and micropiles; ground-anchor tiebacks; underpinning or jacking an existing structure; concrete footings, grade beams and excavation contracts; factory pile manufacture; the subsequent superstructure and operation. New enabling access or interface work attributable to the installation must be included with an explicit owner or recorded as an unresolved route-fit gap. Substantial excavation/concrete or incompatible site remediation requires a separately governed package, not silent omission. CPC 54512 is broader than this rotary route. [un-cpc3-2025] | `chance-helical-installation-2017`; `un-cpc3-2025` |
| rotary_boundary | all processes | Include mobilization, supplied components and actual logistics, rotary drive/thrust, extension joining, all attributable failed/reaction/remedial positions, cap integration, specified tests and defect closure. No grouting or concrete footing burden may be hidden inside this route. | chance-helical-installation-2017 |
| enabling_owner | rotary_install | Record actual temporary access, utility protection and obstruction handling resources with an explicit physical owner. Reusable mats enter asset attribution; consumed materials, freight, energy and actual removed material require concrete exchanges. If actual work cannot be represented, stop foreground finalization and extend the inventory under review. Do not declare needed work pre-existing. | chance-helical-installation-2017 |
| ground_and_waste | rotary_install | Rotary displacement does not imply exported spoil. Record actual removed obstruction/soil only with measured identity, custody and destination; retained ground is not a waste output or avoided-disposal credit. Returned reusable sections, discarded steel and elementary releases have different owners. | chance-helical-installation-2017 |
| asset_periods | all processes | Identify rotary carrier, torque head, drive adapters, access mats, cap tools, test jack/pump and reaction equipment. Track commissioning, use across this and other jobs/reporting periods, maintenance, replacement and end-of-life; allocate complete-life burdens to actual service with one matrix and one event owner. Missing lifetime/coverage evidence remains a blocker, never zero capital burden. |  |


## 6. Process Inventory Structure

### Process Map

| process_id | process_name | inclusion | inclusion_condition | role | quantitative_reference |
| --- | --- | --- | --- | --- | --- |
| rotary_install | Rotary insertion and bolted extension assembly | required | Actual designed rotary ungrouted pile installation | Assembly and integration of lead/extension/coupling components into installed pile assemblies; embedded actual enabling/obstruction work | Actual installed assemblies by pile and purpose, transferred to cap_accept; all failed/reaction work attributable per final reference flow |
| cap_accept | Steel cap integration and conditional test acceptance | required | Actual approved steel cap/interface connection; load tests only when engineer specifies or directs them | Assembly and integration of installed pile and steel cap/hardware into accepted load-transfer interface | 1 Item(s) accepted foundation contract group; test and rework resources included before handover |


The installed-pile handoff is a physical assembled state with pile/transfer IDs and actual count, depth and torque evidence. It is internal, not another sold service. Conditional load tests are embedded actions of cap_accept; a document receipt or inspection alone is not a separate production node. Failed/reaction piles return to rotary_install for extraction/reinstallation, with costs and burdens retained by the same contract group.

### Process: Rotary insertion and bolted extension assembly (`rotary_install`)

#### Inputs

##### Product flows

###### Actual fabricated galvanized steel helical pile lead sections (`lead_sections`)

Factory-fabricated/coated leads enter at their actual supply gate, separately by approved model, helix/shaft configuration and coating. Include permanent, failed, replacement and reaction-test positions; supplier-included couplings/bolts stay in that bill. Range evidence need: Obtain part-specific supplier weights or calibrated weighed lots and actual gross receipts for the declared pile schedule, including failed/test leads; no universal lead kg or helix-count conversion.

- Selected flow: Actual fabricated galvanized steel helical pile lead sections
- Flow property / unit: Mass / kg
- Amount rule: Measured gross received/issued lead mass allocated to this reference group; retain opening/closing stock and actual outward return ledger.
- Value mode: `foreground_record`
- Specificity: `site_specific`
- Normalization basis: per reference flow
- Basis kind: `reference_flow`
- Evidence kind: `collected_record`
- Collection protocol: `cp_install_materials`
- Sources: `chance-helical-installation-2017`



###### Actual fabricated galvanized steel helical pile extension sections (`extension_sections`)

Actual extension sections and their integral couplings are supplied products; their extra depth and failed attempts belong to the job. Do not add a second forging/galvanizing burden. Range evidence need: Collect extension lengths, shaft/wall/model-specific masses, actual count, gross receipts and returns; project depth alone cannot determine kg and example guide dimensions are not current universal specifications.

- Selected flow: Actual fabricated galvanized steel helical pile extension sections
- Flow property / unit: Mass / kg
- Amount rule: Actual gross extension-section supply mass by model/lot and job issues, including replacement and reaction piles.
- Value mode: `foreground_record`
- Specificity: `site_specific`
- Normalization basis: per reference flow
- Basis kind: `reference_flow`
- Evidence kind: `collected_record`
- Collection protocol: `cp_install_materials`
- Sources: `chance-helical-installation-2017`



###### Actual separately supplied helical extension coupling bolts (`coupling_bolts`)

Only separately supplied bolts not already in extension supply enter this exchange, split by actual grade/size/coating identity. Range evidence need: Actual bolt bill of supply, package mass/count and verified part mass must establish the interval and included-component check; no generic bolt allowance.

- Selected flow: Actual separately supplied helical extension coupling bolts
- Flow property / unit: Mass / kg
- Amount rule: Gross separately supplied bolt mass attributable to the actual installation group; zero when already supplier-included.
- Value mode: `foreground_record`
- Specificity: `site_specific`
- Normalization basis: per reference flow
- Basis kind: `reference_flow`
- Evidence kind: `collected_record`
- Collection protocol: `cp_install_materials`
- Sources: `chance-helical-installation-2017`



###### Actual diesel fuel supplied to rotary installation plant (`installation_diesel`)

Fuel covers actual mobilization, insertion, standby, extraction, remedial and reaction-pile work owned by this node. Provider-included fuel is excluded from a second local charge. Range evidence need: Use full-campaign tank/meter opening, receipts, issues and closing records, equipment duty and allocation uncertainty; no generic litres/pile or energy factor.

- Selected flow: Actual diesel fuel supplied to rotary installation plant
- Flow property / unit: Mass / kg
- Amount rule: Attribute fuel supply S_kg = attributed opening_kg + actual net-tare receipts_kg - burden-carried closing_kg for the same diesel grade, node and period. Retain all nonreturned unburned waste and uncontained losses in S: they required upstream supply. Under the declared gross-with-outward-flows convention, real usable outward returns/other-owner transfers retain their measured outward amount and carried burden; only an explicitly declared consumed-only convention may subtract those same usable quantities once, with no second burden export. Closing stock is carried forward, never an outward return. Quantity is S_kg divided once by the actual accepted contract-group reference denominator. S_kg is not combustion activity.
- Value mode: `foreground_record`
- Specificity: `site_specific`
- Normalization basis: per reference flow
- Basis kind: `reference_flow`
- Evidence kind: `collected_record`
- Collection protocol: `cp_install_energy`



###### Actual grid electricity for electrically powered installation equipment (`installation_electricity`)

Conditional on actual electrically powered rotary equipment, charging or other installation demand; electricity retains native energy measurement and actual supply mix. Range evidence need: Collect calibrated meter intervals, charging coverage, standby and allocation records under actual equipment duty; no fixed kWh per pile and no Count substitute for Energy.

- Selected flow: Actual grid electricity for electrically powered installation equipment
- Flow property / unit: Energy / kWh
- Amount rule: Metered kWh attributable to this group/node when active, with charging and losses boundary documented.
- Value mode: `foreground_record`

- Normalization basis: per reference flow
- Basis kind: `reference_flow`
- Evidence kind: `collected_record`
- Collection protocol: `cp_install_energy`



###### Actual separately consumed hydraulic make-up oil (`hydraulic_topup`)

Conditional on measured make-up oil consumed during this node; circulating equipment fill is not automatically consumed and lifetime maintenance oil must not be charged again. Range evidence need: Record actual grade, mass additions, recoveries, maintenance owner and leak incidents; no permanently consumed oil per operating hour assumption.

- Selected flow: Actual separately consumed hydraulic make-up oil
- Flow property / unit: Mass / kg
- Amount rule: Actual separate oil issues less evidenced usable stock reconciliation; identify product grade and the reason for consumption.
- Value mode: `foreground_record`
- Specificity: `site_specific`
- Normalization basis: per reference flow
- Basis kind: `reference_flow`
- Evidence kind: `collected_record`
- Collection protocol: `cp_install_energy`



###### Complete-life share of actual reusable rotary carrier machine (`rotary_carrier_asset`)

The distinct carrier is a reusable capital product, not installed foundation steel. Its production, maintenance/replacement and end-of-life share covers this node and separately records other jobs/periods. Range evidence need: Require actual asset identity, commissioning/retirement, same-duty life-service denominator, logged node use and other consumer matrix; no assumed lifetime or one whole carrier per contract.

- Selected flow: Complete-life share of actual reusable rotary carrier machine
- Flow property / unit: Number of items / Item(s)
- Amount rule: Fractional actual asset item representing the recorded node service share of complete-life service; operating fuel/electricity accounted separately.
- Value mode: `calculated_value`
- Specificity: `site_specific`
- Normalization basis: per reference flow
- Basis kind: `reference_flow`
- Evidence kind: `calculated_from_collection`
- Collection protocol: `cp_install_assets`



###### Complete-life share of actual reusable rotary torque head and matched drive adapter (`rotary_head_asset`)

Record the actual torque head and adapter as distinct assets where separately supplied; one card covers one actual configured supplied assembly only. Do not sum unrelated tooling identities into that assembly. Range evidence need: Obtain actual assembly bill, torque capacity/calibration, component replacement history and complete-life service evidence; separate mismatched lifetimes rather than inventing one ratio.

- Selected flow: Complete-life share of actual reusable rotary torque head and matched drive adapter
- Flow property / unit: Number of items / Item(s)
- Amount rule: Actual fractional item share for the configured head/adapter assembly, with separate rows required if their supply and lifetimes differ.
- Value mode: `calculated_value`
- Specificity: `site_specific`
- Normalization basis: per reference flow
- Basis kind: `reference_flow`
- Evidence kind: `calculated_from_collection`
- Collection protocol: `cp_install_assets`



###### Complete-life share of actual reusable temporary access mat (`temporary_access_mats_asset`)

Conditional on actual reusable access mats installed for this group. Record each distinct mat specification as its own exchange, actual placement/removal work and energy, not free pre-existing access. Range evidence need: Actual mat count/specification, rental or owned coverage, occupation/load-duty records, production/maintenance/end-of-life and other period use are required; consumed aggregate/access works trigger reviewed inventory extension.

- Selected flow: Complete-life share of actual reusable temporary access mat
- Flow property / unit: Number of items / Item(s)
- Amount rule: Fractional item share of actual matched mat type by loaded use and complete-life service, including installation/removal attributable resources.
- Value mode: `calculated_value`

###### Actual rotary-installed bolted steel helical pile assembly at cap integration handoff (`installed_pile_assembly`)

Physical internal transfer identifies actual pile position, lead/extensions, depth, angle, torque and disposition. Permanent and reaction/test assemblies are separately tagged; failed/unaccepted attempts never inflate final accepted service count. Range evidence need: Collect actual as-installed schedule, transfer acceptance, failed/reaction counts and design termination records; the group reference of one service does not prescribe pile count.

- Selected flow: Actual rotary-installed bolted steel helical pile assembly at cap integration handoff
- Flow property / unit: Number of items / Item(s)
- Amount rule: Actual number of installed assemblies transferred by pile ID and purpose; not fixed to one and not sold again as a final service.

- Specificity: `site_specific`
- Normalization basis: per reference flow
- Basis kind: `reference_flow`
- Evidence kind: `collected_record`
- Collection protocol: `cp_install_records`
- Sources: `chance-helical-installation-2017`



###### Actual usable lead sections returned across the installation boundary (`lead_returns`)

Only real outward custody transfer of usable uninstalled or extracted/requalified lead sections is a return. A section retained on site is closing stock; a failed unusable section is waste. Range evidence need: Require outward receipt, condition/requalification, exact part mass and receiving owner; no assumed return percentage and no input netting followed by duplicate export.

- Selected flow: Actual usable lead sections returned across the installation boundary
- Flow property / unit: Mass / kg
- Amount rule: Measured gross outward returned lead mass by lot and condition; retain gross supply input and reconcile burdens without automatic displacement credit.

- Specificity: `site_specific`
- Normalization basis: per reference flow
- Basis kind: `reference_flow`
- Evidence kind: `collected_record`
- Collection protocol: `cp_install_materials`



###### Actual usable extension sections returned across the installation boundary (`extension_returns`)

Usable extension returns preserve actual model, custody, condition and carried burden; removed test/reaction sections require documented reuse qualification. Range evidence need: Actual receiving custody receipts, extraction/inspection results, component mass and stock closure establish the return amount; no universal recovery fraction.

- Selected flow: Actual usable extension sections returned across the installation boundary
- Flow property / unit: Mass / kg
- Amount rule: Actual measured outward returned extension mass by supply lot; retained stock is only a stock balance.
- Value mode: `foreground_record`

- Evidence kind: `collected_record`
- Collection protocol: `cp_install_materials`

### Process: Steel cap integration and conditional test acceptance (`cap_accept`)

#### Inputs

##### Product flows

###### Actual rotary-installed bolted steel helical pile assembly at cap integration handoff (`installed_pile_feed`)

Counterpart internal handoff to installed_pile_assembly uses the same transfer/pile IDs, purpose and actual amount; its upstream burden passes once into the final group. Range evidence need: Reconcile actual paired transfer counts/IDs and withheld failed positions; obtain configuration, depth, torque and reaction purpose evidence, not an assumed one-pile service.

- Selected flow: Actual rotary-installed bolted steel helical pile assembly at cap integration handoff
- Flow property / unit: Number of items / Item(s)
- Amount rule: Actual accepted-for-integration assembly count by transfer ID; no reference-based fixed feed count.
- Value mode: `foreground_record`

###### Actual manufacturer-approved galvanized-surface repair coating (`field_repair_coating`)

Conditional on actual approved field-cut/damaged galvanized surface repair; exact supplied formulation/state is required. Factory coating is already in component supply, not repeated here. Other actual preparation/repair consumables require separately identified exchanges. Range evidence need: Obtain actual approved product/TDS, repair area and issued/applied/waste measurements, wet/dry or volatile content evidence where needed; no universal zinc fraction, repair dose or wet-to-dry factor.

###### Actual diesel fuel for cap integration and load-testing equipment (`cap_test_diesel`)

Conditional actual diesel covers cap work, test/retest and reaction-system removal owned by this node; it excludes already charged rotary-install fuel and provider-included demand. Range evidence need: Require tank/meter mass or volume with actual density/temperature, full test campaign and standby records and cross-node reconciliation; no fixed testing fuel.

- Selected flow: Actual diesel fuel for cap integration and load-testing equipment
- Flow property / unit: Mass / kg
- Amount rule: Attribute fuel supply S_kg = attributed opening_kg + actual net-tare receipts_kg - burden-carried closing_kg for the same diesel grade, node and period. Retain all nonreturned unburned waste and uncontained losses in S: they required upstream supply. Under the declared gross-with-outward-flows convention, real usable outward returns/other-owner transfers retain their measured outward amount and carried burden; only an explicitly declared consumed-only convention may subtract those same usable quantities once, with no second burden export. Closing stock is carried forward, never an outward return. Quantity is S_kg divided once by the actual accepted contract-group reference denominator. S_kg is not combustion activity.

###### Complete-life share of actual reusable load-test jack and pump assembly (`test_equipment_asset`)

Conditional on engineer-required load testing. This is one supplied jack/pump assembly only where documented; independent jack/pump, beam and reaction apparatus have separately recorded assets and lifetimes, never an anonymous equipment sum. Reaction piles themselves are in rotary_install materials/work. Range evidence need: Require actual load plan, calibrated jack/pump assembly bill, reaction apparatus identities and coverage, service-life use/maintenance/end-of-life records; no assumed tests or universal load/hold time.

- Selected flow: Complete-life share of actual reusable load-test jack and pump assembly

###### Complete-life share of actual reusable load-test reaction frame or beam (`test_reaction_frame_asset`)

Conditional on actual test plan using a separately supplied reaction frame/beam; identify each configured asset separately from the jack/pump and installed reaction piles. Retain erection/removal resources and actual counterweight logistics if used. Range evidence need: Collect actual frame/beam bill, test configuration, duty/service history, maintenance, replacements and end-of-life plus other jobs/periods; no assumption that jack coverage includes the reaction system.

- Selected flow: Complete-life share of actual reusable load-test reaction frame or beam
- Flow property / unit: Number of items / Item(s)
- Amount rule: Actual fractional configured frame/beam item from attributable test/retest service and documented complete-life denominator.

###### Physically segregated discarded steel cap (`cap_steel_waste_cap`)

This card is only the actual captured physically segregated discarded steel cap at its recorded dispatch state and receiver. Activate only when that stream is physically separately measured/handled; if materials remain in one mixed carrier, keep that actual mixture under the mandatory refinement ledger and do not also charge its included constituents here.

###### Actual waste residue of the supplied approved galvanized-surface repair coating (`repair_coating_waste`)

Conditional on actual repair-product residue sent to a documented waste receiver. Preserve actual formulation/wet state, container-tare and hazardous status; packaging and other cleaning products need separate concrete exchanges. Range evidence need: Actual issued/applied/residual product weights, container tare, supplied formulation and waste receipt are required; capture actual volatile species/medium separately if released, not as missing unexplained mass.

- Selected flow: Actual waste residue of the supplied approved galvanized-surface repair coating

Conditional on actual fossil combustion in cap/test equipment, with air medium and node-specific ownership; upstream energy-production emissions remain in supplier datasets. Range evidence need: Require exact fuel amount/composition/oxidation or calibrated exhaust measurements and uncertainty; no arbitrary CO2 factor or double count of rotary-install events.

- Selected flow: Actual fossil carbon dioxide from cap and test combustion to air
- Flow property / unit: Mass / kg

## 7. Allocation and Co-product Handling

| rule_id | Applies to | Rule | source_ids |
| --- | --- | --- | --- |
| single_service | accepted_foundation_service | The accepted group is the intended final output; no co-product from rejected steel, retained ground or temporary reaction piles is assumed. Use actual separate contract groups and resources when several products are delivered. |  |
| rework_retention | all processes | Failed depth/torque, damaged sections, misalignment, unacceptable cap or load test retain all attempts, additional sections, energy, relocation, extraction, reaction-pile work and retests in the accepted group. Link loop/event IDs and final reuse/return/waste disposition; unresolved failures cannot be accepted outputs. | chance-helical-installation-2017 |
| gross_stock_return | all material rows | Reconcile opening stock plus gross receipts with installed/consumed material, actual outward usable returns, measured waste/loss and closing retained stock by actual identity. Do not net returns in inputs then export them again. Closing stock is carried forward with its declared burden, not an outward exchange; actual reused components retain their prior allocation history. Gross receipts/issues mean material totals before returns or outward transfers are deducted, with vehicle/container tare already removed; they never mean gross loaded vehicle weight. Where gross_kg and tare_kg are recorded, subtract tare to obtain material mass entering the physical balance. Keep genuine outward flows and retained stock distinct.|  |
| shared_complete_life | asset rows | For each distinct asset use documented physical service during this job/node divided by actual complete-life service of the same unit and duty; apply that share to production, maintenance/replacement and end-of-life without duplicating operating fuel. Index every other consuming job/node/reporting period and reconcile total shares. If using a bounded provider service, document actual capital and operating coverage and remove the overlapping local rows.  For an asset whose life is completed, use observed full-life history. For an in-service asset, an evidenced prospective remaining-service, replacement, termination and end-of-life scenario is allowed; label forecasts separately from observed facts, record the denominator/source, uncertainty and sensitivity, and update when actual use, replacement or retirement changes. Do not fabricate a future retirement_date or assume an arbitrary default life; only missing evidenced complete-life coverage or denominator blocks finalization.|  |
| period_events | all processes | Declare mobilization/start, each installation/test/rework event, acceptance and stock close/open periods, plus asset commissioning/replacements/retirement. Assign each event once; reconcile carried-forward stock and remaining asset burden between periods without resetting lifetime at year end. |  |
| atom_grouped_ledgers | all actual-child records | Apply each existing formula only to its applicable role: material stock, asset lifecycle fraction/hourly provision, completed service event, internal transfer and species/fate calculations are distinct. Never apply material-stock or full-machine purchase equations to an asset share or service event. Within the applicable method group, use concrete child identity/material, state, one exchange property/unit, receiving medium and ownership/event scope. Native and converted views are nonadditive. A family diagnostic total is never a flow identity or every child numerator; keep incomplete portions explicit. Complete formulations, assemblies and genuinely bounded single-function services remain whole, with included constituents/resources not purchased again. |  |

Reconcile opening plus gross receipts to installation, actual outward returns, waste and retained closing stock without netting twice; include reaction/failed/remedial positions. | kg; part count; actual length m | Each receipt/issue/use/transfer/test/rework/exit event and period close as applicable | Complete actual contract campaign including mobilization, failed/reaction piles, retests and acceptance; link earlier/later stock and asset-life periods | Actual site, supplying lot/provider and named equipment/event; no unrelated job mixing | per reference flow | Matched part/lot counts, calibration and supplier inclusion evidence; investigate residual beyond actual measured uncertainty; retain stock burden carry-forward, no fixed loss or range. |

Retain all nonreturned unburned waste and uncontained losses in S: they required upstream supply. Under the declared gross-with-outward-flows convention, real usable outward returns/other-owner transfers retain their measured outward amount and carried burden; only an explicitly declared consumed-only convention may subtract those same usable quantities once, with no second burden export. Closing stock is carried forward, never an outward return. Quantity is S_kg divided once by the actual accepted contract-group reference denominator. S_kg is not combustion activity. Measure actual burned diesel B_kg independently by calibrated burner/engine issue-and-recovery records, or a complete disjoint same-grade fate balance: opening + receipts = closing + B + usable outward return + real other-owner transfer + nonburned waste + uncontained loss. Spill-total is an incident diagnostic: allocate recovered portions to their final closing/return/waste fate once, never subtract the incident total again. Unknown loss or unresolved balance is not inferred burned fuel or zero. Record event/node/provider ownership, full campaign standby/extraction/reaction/test/retest demand and uncertainty. Actual volume-to-mass conversion uses same-batch density, temperature and source once. Retain independent electricity and hydraulic top-up/maintenance records and exclude provider or complete-life overlaps. | kg; L; kg/L; degC; kWh; h | Each receipt/issue/use/transfer/test/rework/exit event and period close as applicable | Complete actual contract campaign including mobilization, failed/reaction piles, retests and acceptance; link earlier/later stock and asset-life periods | Actual site, supplying lot/provider and named equipment/event; no unrelated job mixing | per reference flow | Complete opening/receipt/closing balances, density evidence and meter calibration; actual duty/activity and supply mix; independently verify Energy support before final exchanges; no assumed fuel/oil factors. |

Use hours for carrier/head/tool duty or actual loaded occupation days for mats without treating h/days as product exchange units; fractional asset Item(s) carries capital share. Separate components with independent lifetime. | Item(s); h; days | Each receipt/issue/use/transfer/test/rework/exit event and period close as applicable | Complete actual contract campaign including mobilization, failed/reaction piles, retests and acceptance; link earlier/later stock and asset-life periods | Actual site, supplying lot/provider and named equipment/event; no unrelated job mixing | per reference flow | Actual life/service logs, remaining-life/replacement/retirement evidence and complete-life burden scope; sum all consumer shares without double ownership. Missing evidenced complete-life denominator/coverage blocks final asset attribution; an in-service prospective scenario may provide remaining service and end-of-life coverage, without invented observed retirement. |
| cp_install_logistics | rotary_install | Actual component/equipment freight for both nodes | Leg/payload/gate transport record | contract_id; leg_id; period_id; consuming_node; physical_exchange_owner_node; custody_event_id; origin; destination; carrier_mode; payload_kg; loaded_distance_km; empty_distance_km; return_leg; supplier_included_gate; equipment_mobilization; uncertainty | Record each actual inbound/inter-site/return/waste leg once, including cap/test supplies, usable component/fuel returns and waste-receiver legs of both nodes. This freight row and cp_install_logistics in rotary_install are the single physical exchange owner; consuming_node tags cap_accept demand without a second local exchange. Pair custody_event_id and leg_id to the appropriate return/waste record; use actual payload tonnes times loaded kilometres and documented actual empty-leg/provider method. Partition by destination node without a second local freight row; treat incompatible freight identities separately. | t*km; kg; km | Each receipt/issue/use/transfer/test/rework/exit event and period close as applicable | Complete actual contract campaign including mobilization, failed/reaction piles, retests and acceptance; link earlier/later stock and asset-life periods | Actual site, supplying lot/provider and named equipment/event; no unrelated job mixing | per reference flow | Tickets/routes/payload and supplier gate evidence; actual empty/shared-load allocation; verify complete compatible Transport support chain before exchange delivery, no default distance or credit. |
| cp_install_records | rotary_install | Installed assembly handoff and every attempt | Pile/transfer/as-built/defect record | contract_id; pile_id; purpose; attempt_id; transfer_id; design_revision; manufacturer_revision; lead_id; extension_ids; bolt_ids; position_coordinates_m; angle_deg; depth_m; torque_Nm; torque_sampling_depth_m; rotation_rpm; advance_m_per_rev; shaft_torque_limit_Nm; required_min_effective_torque_Nm; specified_min_depth_m; effective_torque_rule; instrument_id; calibration_date; specified_tolerance; acceptance_source; disposition; event_date | Record each actual permanent/failed/reaction pile and attempt using current approved engineer/manufacturer procedures. Log calibrated installation torque history/depth/angle and instructed rotation/advance with actual units, tolerances and document clauses. Confirm engineer-authorized deviations and pair physical transfer to cap_accept; use project termination criteria, not guide example settings or torque-capacity factors. | Item(s); m; deg; Nm; rpm; m/rev | Each receipt/issue/use/transfer/test/rework/exit event and period close as applicable | Complete actual contract campaign including mobilization, failed/reaction piles, retests and acceptance; link earlier/later stock and asset-life periods | Actual site, supplying lot/provider and named equipment/event; no unrelated job mixing | per reference flow | Authorized installer and instrument calibration; full torque/depth record and approved departures; actual pile count/configuration and rejected dispositions; transfer counterpart agreement and location traceability. |
| cp_install_waste | rotary_install | Steel/timber/spent oil/incidental mineral waste exits | Typed waste consignment and incident ledger | contract_id; event_id; pile_id; period_id; waste_identity; grade; coating; contamination; waste_status; gross_kg; tare_kg; net_kg; volume_m3; actual_bulk_density_kg_per_m3; destination; receiver_id; custody_receipt; treatment_coverage; spill_id; uncertainty | Weigh each actual separately identified stream and retain receiver/custody evidence; volume-based mineral mass needs measured actual bulk density. Distinguish real usable return, stock, waste and incident release; no automatic ground spoil. Record removal/enabling fuel and equipment once. | kg; m3; kg/m3 | Each receipt/issue/use/transfer/test/rework/exit event and period close as applicable | Complete actual contract campaign including mobilization, failed/reaction piles, retests and acceptance; link earlier/later stock and asset-life periods | Actual site, supplying lot/provider and named equipment/event; no unrelated job mixing | per reference flow | Weighbridge/tare/calibration, waste classification and receiver receipts; life-maintenance ownership for spent oil; actual obstruction approval; unresolved material/destination triggers route-fit/inventory extension. |
| cp_install_emissions | rotary_install | Actual fossil CO2 and PM2.5 plus separately identified actual releases | Measured emission or specific factor/composition model | contract_id; event_id; period_id; equipment_id; actual_burned_fuel_kg; carbon_mass_fraction; oxidation_fraction; retained_carbon_kg; species; medium; particle_fraction; measured_release_kg; factor_value; factor_unit; factor_source; activity_value; activity_unit; uncertainty; fuel_supply_attributed_kg_nonadditive_audit; factor_numerator_unit; factor_denominator_unit; factor_complete_species_basis; fossil_fraction_of_carbon; carbon_basis; retained_carbon_basis; molecular_ratio_source; matched_burn_event_ids | Use an actual measured species release, or a source-specific model with actual burned fuel B_kg from the energy protocol; fuel supply S_kg is never substituted for B_kg. A complete fossil-CO2 species factor multiplied by matched B/activity is used as already defined, with no additional carbon fraction, fossil fraction or 44/12. Alternatively calculate oxidized fossil carbon from B and documented composition: establish whether the carbon fraction is total-fuel carbon and whether a fossil share is a share of that carbon; apply each applicable share once. Treat oxidation/retained or unoxidized carbon once using one consistent basis, then multiply oxidized fossil-carbon kg by documented CO2/C molecular-mass ratio 44/12 once. Do not both apply an oxidation loss fraction and subtract the same retained carbon. PM2.5 uses exact measured fraction/species or a compatible equipment/duty factor times its actual stated activity; a fuel-based factor uses B, while other factor units require their own independently measured activity. Retain numerator/denominator units, complete-factor basis, source/version, measurement and uncertainty.

Weigh actual approved galvanized-surface repair product only if instructed and used, with wet/applied/residue/volatile evidence. Reconcile gross supply, outward returns and carried stock by identity; no duplicated factory coating or package bolts. | kg; m2; actual supplied composition units | Each receipt/issue/use/transfer/test/rework/exit event and period close as applicable | Complete actual contract campaign including mobilization, failed/reaction piles, retests and acceptance; link earlier/later stock and asset-life periods | Actual site, supplying lot/provider and named equipment/event; no unrelated job mixing | per reference flow | Approved drawings/product instructions, actual part masses/calibration, supply bill and return receipts; separate material variants.

Retain all nonreturned unburned waste and uncontained losses in S: they required upstream supply. Under the declared gross-with-outward-flows convention, real usable outward returns/other-owner transfers retain their measured outward amount and carried burden; only an explicitly declared consumed-only convention may subtract those same usable quantities once, with no second burden export. Closing stock is carried forward, never an outward return. Quantity is S_kg divided once by the actual accepted contract-group reference denominator. S_kg is not combustion activity. Measure actual burned diesel B_kg independently by calibrated burner/engine issue-and-recovery records, or a complete disjoint same-grade fate balance: opening + receipts = closing + B + usable outward return + real other-owner transfer + nonburned waste + uncontained loss. Spill-total is an incident diagnostic: allocate recovered portions to their final closing/return/waste fate once, never subtract the incident total again. Unknown loss or unresolved balance is not inferred burned fuel or zero. Record event/node/provider ownership, full campaign standby/extraction/reaction/test/retest demand and uncertainty. Actual volume-to-mass conversion uses same-batch density, temperature and source once. Retain independent electricity and hydraulic top-up/maintenance records and exclude provider or complete-life overlaps. | kg; L; kg/L; degC; kWh; h | Each receipt/issue/use/transfer/test/rework/exit event and period close as applicable | Complete actual contract campaign including mobilization, failed/reaction piles, retests and acceptance; link earlier/later stock and asset-life periods | Actual site, supplying lot/provider and named equipment/event; no unrelated job mixing | per reference flow | Calibration/density and complete test-event/activity logs; no mandatory test quantity, generic fuel factor or energy-to-count conversion; verify actual Energy identity chain. |

Record approved cap/adapter connection and actual fastening criteria; perform load tests only per actual engineer plan, recording calibrated load/displacement/hold time and exact criteria. Close every failed/reaction/retest disposition and obtain signed foundation-interface acceptance before declaring one final service item. | Item(s); Nm; kN; mm; s | Each receipt/issue/use/transfer/test/rework/exit event and period close as applicable | Complete actual contract campaign including mobilization, failed/reaction piles, retests and acceptance; link earlier/later stock and asset-life periods | Actual site, supplying lot/provider and named equipment/event; no unrelated job mixing | per reference flow | Qualified installer, actual instrument/tolerance/source evidence and engineer approvals; zero unresolved defective accepted positions; matched transfer IDs and accepted count; no generic capacity or universal test settings. |

A complete fossil-CO2 species factor multiplied by matched B/activity is used as already defined, with no additional carbon fraction, fossil fraction or 44/12. Alternatively calculate oxidized fossil carbon from B and documented composition: establish whether the carbon fraction is total-fuel carbon and whether a fossil share is a share of that carbon; apply each applicable share once. Treat oxidation/retained or unoxidized carbon once using one consistent basis, then multiply oxidized fossil-carbon kg by documented CO2/C molecular-mass ratio 44/12 once. Do not both apply an oxidation loss fraction and subtract the same retained carbon. PM2.5 uses exact measured fraction/species or a compatible equipment/duty factor times its actual stated activity; a fuel-based factor uses B, while other factor units require their own independently measured activity. Retain numerator/denominator units, complete-factor basis, source/version, measurement and uncertainty. No upstream fuel-production emissions are added as local exhaust; other actual species/media and nonburned fates require separate exact identities. | kg; actual composition/activity units | Each receipt/issue/use/transfer/test/rework/exit event and period close as applicable | Complete actual contract campaign including mobilization, failed/reaction piles, retests and acceptance; link earlier/later stock and asset-life periods | Actual site, supplying lot/provider and named equipment/event; no unrelated job mixing | per reference flow | Actual composition/measurement and factor compatibility, air/soil/water medium, uncertainty, campaign completeness and cross-node ownership; upstream fuel emissions are separate. |

### Calculation Rules

| rule_id | Applies to | Formula or rule | Inputs | Output | source_ids |
| --- | --- | --- | --- | --- | --- |
| event_normalization | all inventory rows | Sum actual uniquely owned event quantities attributable to the accepted contract group; report per reference flow. Internal transfers cancel at the group boundary, and physical feed counts remain actual. | Contract/event/period IDs; cp_install_records; cp_cap_records; relevant node protocol | Actual exchange amount per reference flow |  |
| direct_release_calculation | installation_fossil_co2, installation_pm25, cap_fossil_co2 | Use an actual measured species release, or a source-specific model with actual burned fuel B_kg from the energy protocol; fuel supply S_kg is never substituted for B_kg. A complete fossil-CO2 species factor multiplied by matched B/activity is used as already defined, with no additional carbon fraction, fossil fraction or 44/12. Alternatively calculate oxidized fossil carbon from B and documented composition: establish whether the carbon fraction is total-fuel carbon and whether a fossil share is a share of that carbon; apply each applicable share once. Treat oxidation/retained or unoxidized carbon once using one consistent basis, then multiply oxidized fossil-carbon kg by documented CO2/C molecular-mass ratio 44/12 once. Do not both apply an oxidation loss fraction and subtract the same retained carbon. PM2.5 uses exact measured fraction/species or a compatible equipment/duty factor times its actual stated activity; a fuel-based factor uses B, while other factor units require their own independently measured activity. Retain numerator/denominator units, complete-factor basis, source/version, measurement and uncertainty. No upstream fuel-production emissions are added as local exhaust; other actual species/media and nonburned fates require separate exact identities. | Node emission and fuel protocols; actual measurement/composition/factor source; actual unit-conversion evidence | Actual substance-specific emitted kg per reference flow and uncertainty interval |  |
| component_balance | lead_sections, extension_sections, coupling_bolts, steel_caps, cap_bolts | Opening stock plus gross receipts equals installed/consumed plus actual outward usable returns plus measured waste/loss plus closing stock for the same identity. Actual differences require investigation using measured uncertainty; do not create a balancing invented exchange. | Node material and waste protocols; actual gross receipts and closing stock | Reconciled physical stock/custody balance and declared carried-forward burden |  |
| asset_service_share | rotary_carrier_asset, rotary_head_asset, temporary_access_mats_asset, cap_tool_asset, test_equipment_asset, test_reaction_frame_asset | Actual node same-duty service divided by documented complete-life same-duty service gives fractional asset Item(s); apply to actual complete-life capital/maintenance/end-of-life burden with one consumer-period matrix. Keep fuel/energy separate and resolve missing life/terminal evidence before finalization. | cp_install_assets; cp_cap_assets; actual asset lifecycle and consumer records | Asset-specific fractional item and complete-life attributable burden per reference flow |  |
| freight_measurement | atom_req_rotary_install_installation_freight actual-child group | Actual payload kg divided by 1000 gives tonnes; multiply actual loaded route km to obtain t*km, with separately documented empty/shared-leg allocation and supplier gate coverage. | cp_install_logistics; actual leg/provider records | Actual tonne-kilometres per reference flow |  |

### Data Quality Requirements

| requirement_id | Applies to | Requirement | Evidence |
| --- | --- | --- | --- |
| identity_and_gate | all cards | Actual identity, supply state, use, custody/waste status and elementary medium/fraction must match a verified concrete flow and independently verified property/unit chain before TIDAS exchange delivery. Candidate unresolved cards are not final exchange UUIDs. | Exact supplier/product/receiver records; platform detail/property/unitgroup chain; named unresolved manifest entries |
| range_and_uncertainty | all cards | Obtain each card-specific missing Range evidence from actual approved configuration and complete campaign records; derive a traceable empirical or measurement uncertainty interval only for the stated gate and denominator. One reference item is a definition, not a physical intensity bound. | Actual minima/maxima or uncertainty method, instrument/specification evidence, sample/event coverage and exclusions; no illustrative guide values used as defaults |
| period_completeness | all processes | Include failed/remedial/reaction positions, temporary access, mobilization, all supply/exit legs, standby, retests and actual emissions. Record each event once across periods; reconcile opening/closing stock and complete-life assets to other jobs. | Event coverage ledger, consumer-period matrix, receipts, handover and exception register |
| project_gate | accepted_foundation_service | Current actual engineer/manufacturer instructions and approved deviations govern torque/depth/angle/cap/test limits.

| atom_req_rotary_install_installation_freight | rotary_install | Mandatory actual-child refinement for rotary_install/inputs/product. Enumerate the distinct actual products, single-function complete services/assets, physical waste carriers or substance/medium releases covered by this role. Preserve these original applicability and evidence obligations: Record actual inbound, intersite and attributable equipment mobilization legs by payload/vehicle/supplier gate; product and freight dataset coverage must not overlap. Returns and waste haul legs retain their own event/destination attribution. Range evidence need: Collect tickets, route distances, payloads, loaded/empty allocation and supplier freight coverage per leg; no generic distance or mass substitution and Transport support remains independently required. Original quantity method, applied separately to each compatible child/material+property+unit/state ledger: Measured tonne-kilometres from actual payload tonnes and loaded route km, with actual empty-leg method disclosed; split actual incompatible freight services. Keep independently supported named child cards; the remainder is not silently absent. Each actual child has one explicit exchange property/unit and independently collected quantity with exact identity/support before final foreground completion. Do not guess a SKU, species, medium, ratio or unit; no heterogeneous total, copied parent quantity/Range or duplicate whole-carrier/component flow. cp_atom_req_rotary_install_installation_freight is required; missing roster/identity/unit/quantity/scope/closure keeps the foreground package incomplete, while candidate methodology may be revised without site data. | Original node protocol cp_install_logistics; independent actual-child roster and evidence |

Enumerate the distinct actual products, single-function complete services/assets, physical waste carriers or substance/medium releases covered by this role. Preserve these original applicability and evidence obligations: Damaged leads/extensions, unrecoverable reaction/failed sections and actual trimming chips are waste only where discarded. Separate actual grade/coating/contamination and destination streams; do not aggregate materially different wastes or treat scrap as accepted foundation output. Range evidence need: Obtain weighed consignment, actual cut lengths/part weights where used, contamination and treatment evidence; no default scrap fraction or avoided virgin-steel credit. Original quantity method, applied separately to each compatible child/material+property+unit/state ledger: Measured actual discarded steel stream mass by failed pile/cut event and receiver, with separate identities when grade/condition/destination differ.

Each actual child has one explicit exchange property/unit and independently collected quantity with exact identity/support before final foreground completion. Do not guess a SKU, species, medium, ratio or unit; no heterogeneous total, copied parent quantity/Range or duplicate whole-carrier/component flow. cp_atom_req_rotary_install_installation_steel_waste is required; missing roster/identity/unit/quantity/scope/closure keeps the foreground package incomplete, while candidate methodology may be revised without site data. | Original node protocol cp_install_waste; independent actual-child roster and evidence |
| atom_req_rotary_install_removed_obstruction | rotary_install | Mandatory actual-child refinement for rotary_install/outputs/waste. Enumerate the distinct actual products, single-function complete services/assets, physical waste carriers or substance/medium releases covered by this role. Preserve these original applicability and evidence obligations: Conditional incidental removal approved within this route, with exact actual mineral/soil identity and custody. Different contaminated soils, rock, buried construction waste or reusable recovered material require separate correctly typed exchanges or route-fit review.

Original quantity method, applied separately to each compatible child/material+property+unit/state ledger: Actual weighed discarded matched mineral stream to its documented receiver; zero where rotary displacement retains ground and no removal occurred. Keep independently supported named child cards; the remainder is not silently absent. Each actual child has one explicit exchange property/unit and independently collected quantity with exact identity/support before final foreground completion. Do not guess a SKU, species, medium, ratio or unit; no heterogeneous total, copied parent quantity/Range or duplicate whole-carrier/component flow. cp_atom_req_rotary_install_removed_obstruction is required; missing roster/identity/unit/quantity/scope/closure keeps the foreground package incomplete, while candidate methodology may be revised without site data. | Original node protocol cp_install_waste; independent actual-child roster and evidence |
| atom_req_cap_accept_cap_steel_waste | cap_accept | Mandatory actual-child refinement for cap_accept/outputs/waste. Enumerate the distinct actual products, single-function complete services/assets, physical waste carriers or substance/medium releases covered by this role. Preserve these original applicability and evidence obligations: Actual unusable rejected caps/bolts or cut remnants go to documented waste receivers, split by actual grade/coating/contamination and destination. They remain attributable to the accepted group. Range evidence need: Collect consignment weights, item identities and rejected-state dispositions, including repeated cap attempts; no default scrap rate or recycling substitution credit. Original quantity method, applied separately to each compatible child/material+property+unit/state ledger: Actual weighed discarded matched steel waste stream mass by cap/defect event and receiver; no duplicate counting with installation scrap. Keep independently supported named child cards; the remainder is not silently absent. Each actual child has one explicit exchange property/unit and independently collected quantity with exact identity/support before final foreground completion. Do not guess a SKU, species, medium, ratio or unit; no heterogeneous total, copied parent quantity/Range or duplicate whole-carrier/component flow. cp_atom_req_cap_accept_cap_steel_waste is required; missing roster/identity/unit/quantity/scope/closure keeps the foreground package incomplete, while candidate methodology may be revised without site data. | Original node protocol cp_cap_waste; independent actual-child roster and evidence |

## 9. Validation Rules

| rule_id | Applies to | Rule | source_ids |
| --- | --- | --- | --- |
| scope_and_gate | accepted_foundation_service | Confirm rotary insertion with subordinate thrust, no grout and approved steel cap interface for new construction. Required torque/depth and conditional load test criteria must be satisfied under actual current approved instructions; do not claim superstructure or building acceptance. | chance-helical-installation-2017; un-cpc3-2025 |
| transfer_and_reference | installed_pile_assembly, installed_pile_feed, accepted_foundation_service | Reconcile paired physical transfer IDs/count/configuration/purpose; preserve actual feed amount and count exactly one accepted group output as 1 Item(s). Failed/reaction assemblies cannot masquerade as accepted service quantity. | chance-helical-installation-2017 |
| reject_closure | all processes | Every failure/rejected section/cap/test has a linked rework/replacement/return/waste disposition and retained burden. Missing closure or reaction/remedial resources blocks final foreground acceptance. | chance-helical-installation-2017 |
| custody_balance | all material and waste rows | Check gross receipts, actual outward returns, installed/consumed/waste/loss and carried closing stock by exact identity, period and custody. No net-return/double-output, retained-stock export or unsupported recycling credit. |  |
