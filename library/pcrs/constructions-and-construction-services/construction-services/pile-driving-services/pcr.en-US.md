# Hammer-driven precast prestressed concrete pile installation services

## 1. Scope and Applicability

This PCR governs data production for impact-hammer installation of factory precast prestressed concrete piles. It starts with actual received sections and released installation interfaces and ends with project acceptance, completed owned head preparation and mechanical connection duties, and demobilization. The actual episode retains setup, driving, restrike/testing, rework and failed work. It prescribes no universal design performance or productivity. Other pile types, welded splices/shoes, structural welding repairs or driving-aid routes require prior scope review.

## 5. System Boundary

### Boundary Abstraction

| Field | Value |
| --- | --- |
| declared_starting_condition | Released project pile positions and design/driving criteria, observed ground/platform and access condition, and actual delivered precast prestressed pile sections |
| starting_condition_role | Observed installation interfaces, without invented site-formation or readiness exchanges |
| product_classification_scope | This mechanical impact-driven precast prestressed route is a narrower installation category within CPC 3.0 54511 |
| recursive_input_rule | If an independently supplied installation service of this same category crosses the boundary, identify its actual scope and provider dataset; do not recursively reconstruct or count its included work again. Within-node phases are not purchased service inputs |
| upstream_dataset_requirement | Link actual delivered pile/material and separately purchased services to compatible state/provider datasets; disclose missing production, transport, equipment-capital or treatment coverage. Identity alone does not prove dataset completeness |
| disclosure | Declare starting interfaces, actual route and excluded responsibilities, pile acceptance gate, reporting periods, provider boundaries, open stock and unresolved identities/quantity evidence |

### Boundary Rules

| rule_id | Applies to | Rule | source_ids |
| --- | --- | --- | --- |
| `scope_eligibility` | foreground_system_boundary | This PCR governs data production for impact-hammer installation of factory precast prestressed concrete piles. It starts with actual received sections and released installation interfaces and ends with project acceptance, completed owned head preparation and mechanical connection duties, and demobilization. The actual episode retains setup, driving, restrike/testing, rework and failed work. It prescribes no universal design performance or productivity. Other pile types, welded splices/shoes, structural welding repairs or driving-aid routes require prior scope review. |  |
| `b_owned` | pile_install | Include received pile sections and actual permanent mechanical shoes/splices; separately retain cushion, head-work and operating consumables. The one accountable node owns actual handling, impact driving, fitting, necessary directed restrikes/tests, head preparation and incidental cleanup through pile acceptance. The output is the accepted installed pile service, never a pile cap. | `fhwa-gec15-2022`; `fhwa-pile-inspection` |
| `b_start` | starting interfaces | Treat released locations, design/driving criteria, ground/platform and access condition as observed starting facts. Existing-asset readiness, inspection steps and within-node stock changes do not themselves create product cards. Reconsider nodes only for an evidenced separately owned material-state handoff. | `pile-installation-attribution-method` |
| `b_route` | route changes | Stop for scope review if welded pile splices/shoe attachment, welded head buildup/structural repair, bored/steel/timber piles or vibration/jetting/predrilling are actually required. Retain the real responsibility; assess route materials, emissions, waste and acceptance rather than hiding welding as a material-free mechanical joint. Pile manufacture, pile caps, excavation and independent site formation are upstream/downstream interfaces outside this foreground. | `fhwa-gec15-2022`; `fhwa-pile-inspection` |
| `b_phases` | periods and ownership | Index receiving/custody, setup/driving, directed restrike/testing, head preparation and acceptance/demobilization with pile, event, equipment and reporting-period links. Track unaccepted/damaged/rejected/abandoned states and engineer-directed redriving, removal or replacement inside pile_install; real material exits retain receiver and state. | `fhwa-gec15-2022`; `pile-installation-attribution-method` |
| `b_assets` | equipment and meters | Identify actual hammer, crane, access/logistics and testing assets and all consuming piles/phases/periods, including owned idle and rework. Record provider fuel/capital/maintenance coverage and meter boundaries. Used asset return is an asset observation, not unused material return; self-owned manufacture attribution requires actual lifetime/service-capacity/use/damage evidence or a disclosed gap. | `pile-installation-attribution-method` |

## 6. Process Inventory Structure

### Process Map

| process_id | process_name | inclusion | inclusion_condition | role | quantitative_reference |
| --- | --- | --- | --- | --- | --- |
| `pile_install` | Hammer-driven precast prestressed concrete pile installation | `required` | Actual reviewed mechanical impact route | One phase-indexed accountable node for handling, mechanical component fitting, driving, directed restrike/testing, head preparation and acceptance; rejected/open states and rework loops retain original pile links | `reference_service`; 1 m |

### Process: Hammer-driven precast prestressed concrete pile installation (`pile_install`)

The within-node event journal shall cover all actual phases, equipment and pile IDs. Permanent components comprise received sections and actual mechanical shoes/joints; an unspliced configuration invents no second component. Setup, restrikes and inspections are events in this responsibility, not separate products. Record engineer-directed redriving, removal and replacement and real return/downgrade/retained/waste/abandoned-in-place fates; unresolved fate remains a gap.

#### Inputs

##### Product flows

###### Delivered prestressed concrete pile sections (`precast_pile_sections`)

Record the whole delivered section, including its actual reinforcement, at receiving. Keep pile ID, prestressing system, solid/void section geometry, certified or measured section mass and delivery length. Record actual sections entering episode custody and allocated opening stock, with independent closing-stock and exit records. Returns recorded as outgoing exchanges must not also be subtracted from the same gross receipt; accepted length is not delivered length. Range evidence need: actual section geometry and same-section mass, cutoff, splice and removal records must establish kg/m. Check each compatible section pool against accepted retained material, cutoffs, rejected/abandoned stock and exits; do not assume a universal pile mass per metre.

###### Accepted pile installation service (`reference_service`)

Count only unique accepted piles after project driving/testing criteria, owned mechanical connections and head preparation are complete. Independently determine positive L as the sum of axial toe-to-actual-cutoff lengths, with surveyed elevations and batter correction. Ordered/delivered lengths, repeated driving passes, rejected piles and abandoned-in-place piles do not add L; their attributable burdens remain. Self-normalization L / L yields exactly 1 m. A test pile accepted as a production pile counts once.

##### Waste flows

###### Actual captured concrete pile-head cutoff composite waste (`concrete_cutoff_waste_cutoff`)

Record only this independently identified actual captured concrete pile-head cutoff composite waste at its actual state and supply or receiving gate.

###### Physically separated reinforcement scrap (`separated_reinforcement_waste`)

Require a real separation and waste dispatch event with cutting/release history. Range evidence need: steel actually present in the removed head pool and independent separated-metal weighing.

###### Removed rejected pile waste (`damaged_pile_waste`)

Require failure assessment, removal/replacement decision and actual waste receiver. Range evidence need: removed pile-ID masses and dispatch records.

###### Collected wastewater and slurry (`collected_wastewater_slurry`)

Measure mixture mass and water/dry-solids/chemical constituents with collection/capture evidence and treatment destination. Range evidence need: actual water sources, entrained solids, concentration or separate constituent measurements and dispatch.

##### Elementary flows

###### Fossil carbon dioxide to air (`fossil_co2_air`)

Determine actual fossil CO2 with an applicable fuel/duty measurement or documented factor/model and uncertainty. Retain the unspecified-air compartment of this identity; a more specific medium needs its own verified identity. Use independently determined fossil carbon actually burned for the carbon constraint, never total diesel kg as CO2 kg. No complete-oxidation assumption or invented oxygen exchange is authorized.

- Binding: Fixed (`fixed`)
- Selected flow: Carbon dioxide (fossil), to air unspecified `08a91e70-3ddc-11dd-923d-0050c2490048`

  - Sources: `carbon-oxidation-identity`

###### Water evaporated to air (`water_vapour_air`)

Require actual wet work and independently supported evaporation measurement/model; zero requires evidence. Preserve the unspecified-air identity. Range evidence need: available water-only pools and a supported evaporation estimate with uncertainty. Compare water constituents and inventory change; a closure residual is not vapour.

## 7. Allocation and Co-product Handling

| rule_id | Applies to | Rule | source_ids |
| --- | --- | --- | --- |
| `a_direct` | shared operating burden | Assign directly measured pile/phase use first. For shared hammer, crane, meter or test resources, list every consumer and period and attribute only the reconciled residual by documented actual duty or another evidenced causal share; shares must exhaust that residual once. Declare idle/setup/test ownership and period-cutoff treatment. | `pile-installation-attribution-method` |
| `a_provider` | provider and reusable assets | Count provider-included fuel, capital and maintenance once; exclude duplicate own diesel/equipment entries for those same included activities. Attribute self-owned manufacture only with actual service capacity/lifetime, episode use and damage evidence, disclosing an unresolved gap otherwise. Reusable equipment mass and its used return do not constitute full consumptive material input/output. | `pile-installation-attribution-method` |
| `a_rework` | rework and accepted length | Retain attributable failed driving, restrike, testing, removal and replacement burdens in the installing lot. Record original pile and event links and actual return/downgrade/retained/waste/abandoned fate. Rejected or open piles contribute no L; repeated passes and a production-accepted test pile cannot repeat L. Unresolved replacement/termination remains an open gap at the period cutoff. | `pile-installation-attribution-method` |
| `a_exits` | material exits and normalization | Record real usable returns and waste dispatch by identity/state/receiver; do not assume avoided production or recovery credit. Separate any evidenced co-product responsibility by subdivision or documented causal treatment. Divide each concrete attributable numerator by the independently measured L once; heterogeneous totals serve QA only. | `pile-installation-attribution-method` |

## 8. Foreground Data Collection, Calculation, and Quality Rules

All four protocols belong to pile_install and use common event/identity/phase keys; each concrete exchange retains its independent amount and conversion evidence. A protocol is not an umbrella flow identity.

### Data Collection Protocols

| protocol_id | process_id | flow_role | record_type | raw_fields | collection_method | unit | frequency | temporal_coverage | site_scope | aggregation_rule | quality_evidence |
| --- | --- | --- | --- | --- | --- | --- | --- | --- | --- | --- | --- |
| `cp_pile_install_material` | `pile_install` | material components, consumables, stocks, exits and reference | pile register and identity/event ledger | event/lot/configuration; pile or asset ID; process/phase/time and reporting period; owner and role; actual identity/SKU/current state; native amount/unit; measured same-state bridge; receiver/medium; evidence and uncertainty; actual occurrence yes/no/unresolved; pile prestressing system and section/void geometry; delivery/accepted/rejected state; toe/cutoff survey and batter; section mass; head/separation/capture; stock movement; criteria revision and head/test/acceptance records; concrete_exchange_id; physical_event_id; actual_identity_id; actual_state; receiver_or_provider_gate; native_quantity; native_unit; unique_property; measurement_method_id; uncertainty | Weigh or use traceable same-section mass certificates and calibrated native measures; survey actual toe and cutoff, correct for axial/batter geometry and reconcile unique accepted piles to inspection/test records. Track opening, receipts, issue, transfers, retained/rejected/abandoned stock and dispatch separately by concrete identity/state/receiver. Aggregation procedure: Determine independent positive accepted L; calculate each concrete attributable material numerator / L per 1 m reference flow; reference_service self-normalizes L / L; heterogeneous totals are QA only. Record each actual child/refined exchange independently by identity, physical event, state, gate and period. Retain all original obligations even where a corresponding exchange identity is not yet known. Do not allocate a family total or copy its numerical Range to children, count a carrier and its contained material twice, or turn missing occurrence/quantity/native reference into zero. Each concrete exchange has one property and one unit; other CP readings are auxiliary and require evidenced conversion. Missing required refinement blocks dataset completion. | kg; m; native count/geometry; measured bridges | every receipt, issue, head/rework/separation, stock cutoff and acceptance/exit event | full episode and opening/closing stocks across all reporting periods | project pile lot and actual material custody boundary | per 1 m reference flow | calibration/certificates; surveys; pile and decision register; signed head/test/acceptance; dispatch receivers |

Convert only with actual same-fuel/state evidence; retain water circulation and shared-meter reconciliation. Distinguish useful equipment energy from purchased electricity or diesel and exclude provider-included duplicate consumption. Aggregation procedure: Assign direct use then evidenced reconciled shared residual once; each concrete attributed utility numerator / L per 1 m reference flow. | kg; kWh; native volume and meter units | each meter interval, fueling, stock change and wet task | complete owned setup/idle/driving/restrike/test/head/rework/demobilization intervals and period cutoffs | all actual equipment and meters serving the project lot, with other consumers identified | per 1 m reference flow | meter calibration, stock tickets, state-specific density, consumer reconciliation and provider boundary |

Observe reusable mass/current condition without treating it as consumed material. For self-owned capital collect actual lifetime/capacity/use/damage; retain a gap where evidence is absent. Aggregation procedure: Each separately purchased concrete service numerator / L per 1 m reference flow; allocate shared and self-owned burden once using evidenced coverage and capacity/use; do not invent lifetime. Record each actual child/refined exchange independently by identity, physical event, state, gate and period. Retain all original obligations even where a corresponding exchange identity is not yet known. Do not allocate a family total or copy its numerical Range to children, count a carrier and its contained material twice, or turn missing occurrence/quantity/native reference into zero. Each concrete exchange has one property and one unit; other CP readings are auxiliary and require evidenced conversion. Missing required refinement blocks dataset completion. | h; native capacity/use and condition measures | each mobilization, duty/idle/rework interval, maintenance, damage and return event | complete service episode and relevant evidenced asset life/service periods | actual hammer/crane/access/logistics/test assets and every consumer | per 1 m reference flow | contracts, invoices, interval logs, consumer list and actual life/use/damage evidence or gap |
| `cp_pile_install_release` | `pile_install` | direct abstraction and substance/medium releases | substance/medium measurement and model ledger | event/lot/configuration; pile or asset ID; process/phase/time and reporting period; owner and role; actual identity/SKU/current state; native amount/unit; measured same-state bridge; receiver/medium; evidence and uncertainty; actual occurrence yes/no/unresolved; exact substance/species/particle and medium; source constituent pool; fossil carbon burned; wet-work water-only input/stock/fate; capture/discharge; model/factor applicability and uncertainty; concrete_exchange_id; physical_event_id; actual_identity_id; actual_state; receiver_or_provider_gate; native_quantity; native_unit; unique_property; measurement_method_id; uncertainty | Use direct measurements or documented applicable emission/evaporation/discharge models with actual fuel, equipment, wet task and source-pool evidence. Retain native measurements and constituent concentrations; independently measure abstraction. Preserve actual medium and do not turn ledger residuals into releases. Aggregation procedure: Calculate each concrete substance-and-medium numerator / L per 1 m reference flow; compare compatible dry constituents, water-only and fossil-carbon pools separately; no residual exchange. Record each actual child/refined exchange independently by identity, physical event, state, gate and period. Retain all original obligations even where a corresponding exchange identity is not yet known. Do not allocate a family total or copy its numerical Range to children, count a carrier and its contained material twice, or turn missing occurrence/quantity/native reference into zero. Each concrete exchange has one property and one unit; other CP readings are auxiliary and require evidenced conversion. Missing required refinement blocks dataset completion. | kg; native discharge volume/concentration and sampling units | each emission-relevant duty/wet/discharge event and representative measurement interval | all applicable phases and actual release/source intervals, including rework | actual equipment/material release points and receiving media for the project lot | per 1 m reference flow | sampling/meter calibration; model/factor scope; composition, capture/receiver and uncertainty evidence |

### Calculation Rules

| rule_id | Applies to | Formula or rule | Inputs | Output | source_ids |
| --- | --- | --- | --- | --- | --- |
| `c_length` | reference_service | L = sum of unique accepted axial lengths from actual toe to actual cutoff plane; use surveyed geometry and batter correction, and exclude unaccepted/rejected/abandoned piles and duplicate driving or test passes. Reference amount = L / L = 1 m for positive L. | pile register; survey; criteria/test/head/acceptance; cp_pile_install_material | L; 1 m reference_service | `accepted-axial-length-identity`; `fhwa-gec15-2022`; `fhwa-driven-length-review` |
| `c_exchange` | all inventory rows | For each actual concrete identity/SKU/current-state/receiver or substance/medium, q_concrete_ref = attributable native amount converted with its own evidenced same-state bridge / L. Apply once; retain constituent amounts separately from whole-mixture mass and do not export heterogeneous sums as exchanges. | actual concrete event amounts; same-state bridge; L; cp_pile_install_material; cp_pile_install_utility; cp_pile_install_asset; cp_pile_install_release | individual normalized concrete exchanges | `pile-installation-attribution-method` |
| `c_shared` | all inventory rows | Separate directly assigned actual use from shared totals; remaining shared burden = reconciled total - direct assignments - explicitly excluded consumer coverage. Attribute that residual once to evidenced consumers/periods using actual duty or documented causal shares summing to one; retain uncertainty and provider coverage. | consumer/phase/period ledger; direct readings; reconciled totals; provider scope; cp_pile_install_utility; cp_pile_install_asset | nonduplicated attributable episode amounts | `pile-installation-attribution-method` |
| `c_pools` | all inventory rows | For each compatible material/current-state or constituent pool, compare opening stock + actual inflows with retained installed/usable stock + closing rejected/open/abandoned stock + independently observed exits/releases. Transformations require explicit measured constituent bridges. Keep water-only fates and fossil carbon independent; report residual and uncertainty without inventing a balancing exchange. | same-pool stock/inflows; measured transformations; actual fates; cp_pile_install_material; cp_pile_install_release | pool QA, disclosed residuals and gaps | `compatible-pool-balance-identity` |
| `c_carbon` | fossil_co2_air | m_CO2_fossil <= C_fossil_burned * 44 / 12; C_fossil_burned is independently determined fossil-carbon mass actually burned. The upper identity does not assert complete oxidation, estimate other species or equate fuel mass to CO2 mass. | actual fuel and fossil-carbon composition; duty; applicable model/measurement; cp_pile_install_release | fossil-carbon CO2 QA constraint | `carbon-oxidation-identity` |

### Data Quality Requirements

| requirement_id | Applies to | Requirement | Evidence |
| --- | --- | --- | --- |
| `dq_gate` | reference_service | Retain pile ID, prestressing system, section/void geometry, delivered mass/length, actual toe/cutoff elevations and axial/batter method, driving-criteria revision, hammer/cushion and mechanical shoe/splice schedule. Match required test, head-preparation and acceptance records; no generic bearing capacity, blow count, energy or test-frequency threshold is prescribed. | survey, signed pile/test/head/acceptance register; fhwa-gec15-2022; fhwa-pile-inspection |
| `dq_occurrence` | all inventory rows | Record each conditional task/material/fate as yes, no or unresolved with evidence. Unknown is not inactive or zero.

## 9. Validation Rules

| rule_id | Applies to | Rule | source_ids |
| --- | --- | --- | --- |
| `v_scope` | pile_install | Verify the actual precast prestressed impact-hammer mechanical route, owned phases and acceptance handoff. A welded or other excluded route requires scope review before applying these rules; separate handoffs require boundary reconsideration. | `pile-installation-attribution-method` |
| `v_reference` | reference_service | Require independent positive L, actual toe/cutoff and axial/batter evidence, criteria revision, complete owned head/mechanical connection duties and required tests/acceptance. Reconcile each unique pile; reject duplicate restrike/test length and unaccepted/rejected/abandoned length. | `pile-installation-attribution-method` |
| `v_events` | periods and rework | Reconcile every input, asset, output and rework/reject event to pile_install, its actual phase and reporting period. Verify real return/downgrade/removal/waste/retained/abandoned fates and original pile links; unresolved termination/replacement blocks finalization while burdens remain. | `pile-installation-attribution-method` |
| `v_shared` | shared assets/services/meters | Enumerate all real hammer/crane/access/test/meter consumers and periods; reconcile direct assignments and residual shares, including owned setup/idle/rework.

| `validate_atomic_exchange_unit_and_normalization` | all inventory rows | Each concrete flow card identifies exactly one actual independently supplied product/SKU/formulation, complete assembly, complete single-function or genuine complete bounded provider service, actual waste composite/state/receiver, or substance/size/receiving medium, with exactly one property and unit. Different actual identities require independent quantities and records, not a summed family exchange. A complete product/carrier includes its contents once. Same unchanged SKU/state usable supply/return pairs and matched physical internal send/receive pairs use the same selected property/unit; kg and count or MJ and kWh auxiliaries are nonadditive measurements, never duplicate exchanges. Missing identity/occurrence/quantity/native reference is a gap, not zero. An asset-equivalent formula already ending in division by N, D or A is the final quantity per reference flow. Its complete-life fraction and accepted-output normalization constitute the same normalization operation as the general normalization rule; never divide it by that denominator again. Apply the complete-life upstream burden exactly once. Actual complete provider event counts remain event quantities, not owned-asset fractions. |  |
