# Interior gypsum skim plastering services

## 1. Scope and Applicability

This methodology covers hand-applied interior gypsum finish plaster over an already suitable accepted plasterboard or undercoat surface, including local joints and edges, powder/water mixing, skim application, setting, trowelling and monitored drying to a declared decorative-readiness acceptance gate. Upstream substrate work, board manufacture and installation, basecoat construction, cement render, paint, demolition and hazardous removal are excluded. The route is a site work-lot and mixing-batch service. It does not establish a universal thickness, formulation, coverage rate or drying duration.

## 5. System Boundary

### Boundary Abstraction

| Field | Value |
| --- | --- |
| declared_starting_condition | Existing substrate accepted suitable for the selected gypsum finish, with substrate construction complete and local joints/edges identified |
| starting_condition_role | Upstream handover prerequisite, followed by included local interface preparation |
| product_classification_scope | A narrower interior gypsum skim route within plastering services |
| recursive_input_rule | Purchased same-category service enters once as identified upstream activity; remove overlapping foreground operations and disclose any recursive truncation. |
| upstream_dataset_requirement | Link powder, supplied water, preparation materials, energy, equipment and transport services to compatible upstream datasets; substrate is an explicit upstream prerequisite with separate ownership, never silently assumed zero. |
| disclosure | Record excluded substrate production/repair and downstream decoration; construction-site location, period, starting acceptance, actual system, utility and waste responsibilities; report unavailable upstream coverage. |

### Boundary Rules

| rule_id | Applies to | Rule | source_ids |
| --- | --- | --- | --- |
| `scope_eligibility` | foreground_system_boundary | This methodology covers hand-applied interior gypsum finish plaster over an already suitable accepted plasterboard or undercoat surface, including local joints and edges, powder/water mixing, skim application, setting, trowelling and monitored drying to a declared decorative-readiness acceptance gate. Upstream substrate work, board manufacture and installation, basecoat construction, cement render, paint, demolition and hazardous removal are excluded. The route is a site work-lot and mixing-batch service. It does not establish a universal thickness, formulation, coverage rate or drying duration. |  |
| scope_gate | substrate; finish | Verify selected plaster suitability for the actual background and include local preparation; major substrate correction remains an upstream prerequisite. | british-gypsum-multifinish-installation |
| reaction_gate | mix; finish; dry_accept | Powder and water form paste in mix; gypsum setting within finish changes retained composition. Report actual product and water states at handoffs, unreacted surplus and residues; do not invent a stoichiometric yield, gas by-product or complete reaction. |  |
| dryness_gate | dry_accept | Trowelling/setting does not prove dry-to-decorate readiness. Continue actual relevant ventilation/heating and monitoring until the declared criterion is met; the manufacturer's staged application timings are product-specific and provide no universal drying endpoint. | british-gypsum-multifinish-installation |
| utility_owner | prep; mix; finish; dry_accept | Identify shared lighting, access platforms and equipment, every consuming node and service period; attribute measured service demand once and disclose mobilization, rental/capital and upstream coverage. Keep the full work lot through actual multi-day drying: record unaccepted surface and water at any reporting cutoff and carry its existing burdens into the same final accepted lot without resetting, truncating or counting them twice. |  |
| water_destination | mix; finish; dry_accept | Keep supplied mixing/finishing/cleaning water, retained water, collected slurry/condensate and actual vapour or direct discharge distinct. No wastewater or dust category may be assumed an elementary emission without substance and receiving-medium evidence. |  |

## 6. Process Inventory Structure

### Process Map

| process_id | process_name | inclusion | inclusion_condition | role | quantitative_reference |
| --- | --- | --- | --- | --- | --- |
| prep | Local substrate interface preparation | required | Accepted suitable existing background | Local joints/edges and preparation interface | Measured prepared area by zone |
| mix | Finish plaster powder/water mixing | required | Actual selected gypsum finish system | Batch formulation, powder/water reconciliation and fresh paste handoff | Measured fresh paste mass by batch |
| finish | Hand application, setting and trowelling | required | Prepared interface and usable fresh paste available | Surface finish and gypsum setting responsibility; correction loops return here | Measured set/trowelled area by zone |
| dry_accept | Drying, inspection and decorative readiness | required | Set/trowelled area awaiting actual final acceptance | Dryness monitoring, attributable utilities and final net accepted service | 1 m2 accepted_skim |

Work lots link zones and mixing batches to labour, stock changes, cleaning, changeovers and acceptance. Prepared area, paste and set-surface transfers are measured independently; they need not equal the final reference amount. Rejected paste stays owned by mix; rejected surface returns to finish and its removed material exits there. No reject or unresolved zone enters accepted area.

### Process: Local substrate interface preparation (`prep`)

###### Lifecycle-complete preparation access service (`prep_access_access`)

One independently identified lifecycle-complete preparation access service. This is a conditional independent object supported within the original prep_access scope; activate only when actually independently supplied, used or dispatched. Keep actual SKU, material/formulation, specification, state and provider or receiver. Preserve complete supplied products, formulations, assemblies, bounded services and actual mixed-waste carriers as whole views; do not add their already included constituents. Usable outward exits match the original input property/unit and require actual custody transfer; closing stock is not an exit and usable original-state items are not waste. Waste retains its producing node, actual contamination/state, receiver and treatment boundary and is not an environmental emission. The same physical cable or SKU serving several duties is counted once, with duty observations nonadditive. Evidence is required for nonoccurrence; this card assumes no occurrence, composition, count or loss factor.

Original role-specific boundary and operating constraints apply only to this independent child; the former family/screen text is neither another exchange nor an inherited Range: Include actual access provision and mobilization when attributable to local preparation; preserve asset and service units in downstream concrete exchanges.

- Selected flow: Lifecycle-complete preparation access service
- Flow property / unit: Duration / h
- Amount rule: Independently collect this child service actual attributable job hours actual_prep_access_access_quantity, fixed Duration/h, then normalize once by original reference denominator accepted_area. Preserve the original asset/service CP task, period and all-consumer scope. Matching upstream burden per h must cover complete-life manufacture, maintenance, replacements and end of life using a compatible complete-life hour driver; never multiply this h exchange by an asset-equivalent fraction again. Owned-asset whole-life physical fractions remain non-exchange reconciliation. Fuel, electricity, transport or operator already included in the actual service have one owner under original coverage. accepted_area=0 or missing complete-life/service-unit/coverage evidence blocks completion; fees, shifts and counts cannot replace actual h. Original quantity convention: prep_service_hours / accepted_area
- Value mode: `calculated_value`
- Specificity: `site_specific`
- Normalization basis: per reference flow
- Basis kind: `reference_flow`
- Evidence kind: `calculated_from_collection`
- Collection protocol: `cp_prep`

Range evidence need: independent actual child quantities, identity/state, conversions, uncertainty and comparable independent observations; no family interval or default coefficient is inherited.

##### Waste flows

###### Removed failed plaster waste (`finish_waste_plaster`)

One independently identified removed failed plaster waste. This is a conditional independent object supported within the original finish_waste scope; activate only when actually independently supplied, used or dispatched. Keep actual SKU, material/formulation, specification, state and provider or receiver. Preserve complete supplied products, formulations, assemblies, bounded services and actual mixed-waste carriers as whole views; do not add their already included constituents. Usable outward exits match the original input property/unit and require actual custody transfer; closing stock is not an exit and usable original-state items are not waste. Waste retains its producing node, actual contamination/state, receiver and treatment boundary and is not an environmental emission. The same physical cable or SKU serving several duties is counted once, with duty observations nonadditive. Evidence is required for nonoccurrence; this card assumes no occurrence, composition, count or loss factor.

Original role-specific boundary and operating constraints apply only to this independent child; the former family/screen text is neither another exchange nor an inherited Range: Rejected zones return for correction to finish with repeat labour and material retained; removed plaster exits as measured waste and rejected area is excluded from accepted_area.

- Selected flow: Removed failed plaster waste
- Flow property / unit: Mass / kg
- Amount rule: Independently collect actual_finish_waste_plaster_quantity in kg. Net weigh this actual object/dispatch, or convert actual count/length with independently evidenced same-SKU/state item or linear mass only when needed; one exchange quantity remains. Apply the original CP opening/receipts/intact-unused closing, installed/consumed, usable exits, waste, processed WIP, real correction and period method without changing its gross/fate convention. Normalize once by the original independently accepted reference denominator accepted_area; accepted_area=0 blocks accepted-service normalization. Never copy a family total, assumed proportion or parent Range; require independent child measurement, conversion and uncertainty evidence. Original quantity convention with original CP operands: finish_waste_mass / accepted_area
- Value mode: `calculated_value`
- Specificity: `site_specific`
- Normalization basis: per reference flow
- Basis kind: `reference_flow`
- Evidence kind: `calculated_from_collection`
- Collection protocol: `cp_finish`

Range evidence need: independent actual child quantities, identity/state, conversions, uncertainty and comparable independent observations; no family interval or default coefficient is inherited.

## 7. Allocation and Co-product Handling

| rule_id | Applies to | Rule | source_ids |
| --- | --- | --- | --- |
| subdivision | work_lots | Subdivide measured zones, batches and utility events before allocation; this route has no intended co-product. Unexpected saleable recovered outputs require their actual status and a separately justified burden decision. |  |
| batch_owner | mix; finish | Index all ingredients, paste transfers, cleaning and changeovers by batch and zone. Assign end-of-shift cleaning once using documented consumed batch mass or measured work time when direct metering is unavailable; preserve the denominator and uncertainty. |  |
| shared_owner | prep; mix; finish; dry_accept | Identify each shared asset, invoice/meter total and period; prefer direct metering, otherwise measured runtime/load or attributable service hours. Sum shares across all consumers to the measured total, including other trades, without duplicating rental/capital, lighting or mobilization. |  |
| reject_owner | mix; finish; dry_accept | Retain all failed-batch and rework burdens in the producing lot. Authorised return material keeps transfer ids and prior burden ownership; rework is additional actual activity, never negative avoided burden or accepted area. |  |

Sum attributable preparation raw or linked derived quantities after unique-event reconciliation, then divide by positive same-lot accepted_area. Retain the original PCR stock, event, denominator, attribution and closure methods above. Maintain an actual-child register by node, period and parent_ledger_id. Each quantity-bearing exchange has one independent physical product, complete formulation/assembly, defined bounded service, actual waste carrier or substance/medium, one fixed property/unit and its independently collected numerator. Retain all original roles, corrections and stock/WIP/fate records. Former family quantities remain non-exchange custody or closure diagnostics only; never copy/divide a family total or Range into children or sum unlike units as an exchange. Each actual SKU/state/provider/receiver is separate when it represents an independent exchange. A supplied complete package and its already included constituents are exclusive views; identical physical cables serving multiple duties are counted once. Missing actual child roster, quantity, activation/absence, identity/state/medium, method or unit support blocks final foreground completion; it is never zero or implicitly not applicable. Foreground records provide the operands; they cannot choose another reference denominator, allocation, stock or fate convention. actual_<row_id>_quantity aliases this record independent physical quantity keyed by atomic_flow_row_id under the original CP method and atomic_child_normalization, never another parent quantity. Actual child records retain legacy_parent_role and own_node_helper_id; independently collect every original role helper operand in child_quantity_operands, grouped by quantity_ledger_group_key material/source-state/current-state/period/unit. Real internal source and recipient match by paired_atomic_row_id and actual_transfer_event_id, never derived from a parent total or unexplained residual. Internal I=F is a reconciliation condition for the same actual material/SKU, state, event, custody boundary and gate, never an assignment formula. Each child retains its own actual dispatch quantity and receipt/custody evidence. The same signed custody measurement may be traceably reused without inventing another weighing. Never copy a family total into each child, overwrite a real receipt or force unknown quantities equal. Preserve discrepancies with original values/units, measurement uncertainty, actual transfer loss, state change and responsible-owner evidence; unresolved differences block completion. Internal quantities remain unnormalized physical amounts, divided by the original reference denominator only at each card final step; parent-role sums are QA only. | kg; kWh; h; m2 | Every zone and utility/service event | Full work lot including rework and changeovers | Named project and preparation zone | per reference flow | Survey/opening schedule; supplier identity; calibrated instruments; shared-share reconciliation |

Derive powder_net_mass by calc_powder_stock. Weigh delivered/returned stock, meter recipe/cleaning water, weigh wet paste and residues; obtain named-species air evidence if applicable; separate captured dust and wash slurry. Reconcile powder and process water against wet paste, separately recorded waste/emissions and stock changes; divide each attributable node numerator by positive same-lot accepted_area without deducting recorded waste twice.

| calc_evaporation | evaporated_water | For declared balance method: evaporated_water_mass = received_surface_water + added_drying_water + opening_water_stock - closing_water_stock - retained_bound_water - residual_free_water - condensate_mass - collected_drying_slurry_water - other_evidenced_water_out. All terms use mutually exclusive same-period water ownership: closing_water_stock covers only other unaccepted end-period water stock and excludes accepted-surface retained_bound_water/residual_free_water; opening_water_stock excludes received_surface_water counted at the period entry. No retained surface water is counted again in other outlets. Water is the same measured process-water pool at all terms; exclude inherited dry-powder crystal water consistently, retain paired batch/zone moisture handoffs, and keep pre-drying losses at their producing nodes. For direct method: evaporated_water_mass = directly_measured_vapour_mass, with calibrated ventilation flow/humidity evidence. Declare method and water_balance_uncertainty; missing fates or negative unexplained balance require investigation, never clamping to zero. | cp_dry_accept; cp_mix; cp_finish; evaporation_method; directly_measured_vapour_mass; received_surface_water; added_drying_water; opening_water_stock; closing_water_stock; retained_bound_water; residual_free_water; condensate_mass; collected_drying_slurry_water; other_evidenced_water_out; water_balance_uncertainty | evaporated_water_mass before calc_dry_accept normalization |  |
| calc_finish_evaporation | finish_vapour | Balance method: finish_vapour_mass = received_paste_water + received_finish_water + opening_finish_water_stock - transferred_surface_water - residue_water - slurry_water - closing_finish_water_stock. All terms are the same process-water pool and exclude inherited dry-powder crystal water; surface handoff includes bound and free water and is paired with dry_accept received_surface_water. The dry node receives only actual transferred_surface_water remaining after finish-stage vapour, slurry and residue removal, never original paste-plus-water dosing; dry_accept cannot count those prior losses again. Opening stock excludes received inputs; closing stock excludes transferred surface and other recorded outlets. Direct method: finish_vapour_mass = directly_measured_finish_vapour_mass using calibrated ventilation-flow/humidity observations. Record finish_evaporation_method and water_balance_uncertainty; missing fates or unexplained negative residuals remain data gaps. | cp_finish; finish_evaporation_method; directly_measured_finish_vapour_mass; received_paste_water; received_finish_water; opening_finish_water_stock; transferred_surface_water; residue_water; slurry_water; closing_finish_water_stock; water_balance_uncertainty | finish_vapour_mass before calc_finish normalization |  |
| atomic_child_normalization | prep_access_access; mix_reject_stale; mix_reject_contaminated; mix_air_water_vapour; finish_access_access; finish_waste_plaster | Record independent_physical_quantity separately by atomic_flow_row_id; actual_<row_id>_quantity is its named alias only, never a copied family amount. Materials retain original CP per-identity/state gross/net stock and outward-return conventions; transfers use actual paired custody quantity; usable exits and wastes use independent actual fate quantities. Number-of-items owned asset equivalents use this PCR original job_driver/full_life_driver complete-life fraction including manufacture, maintenance, replacement and end of life, with every consumer and a positive complete denominator. Duration/h service children instead use actual attributable job hours with the matching complete-life burden per hour; never multiply hours by the fraction again. Purchased services use only actual complete physical tasks whose real contract defines Item(s), with original actual attribution; hours, days and prices cannot become event counts. atomic_child_intensity = independent_physical_quantity / accepted_area, where accepted_area is unique net finally accepted skim-coated surface area in m2 under net_area under the original acceptance rule; accepted_area=0 blocks normalization. Non-exchange parent role ledgers and original CP operands retain their stock, transfer, closure and ownership functions, without adding a second exchange or changing the method. | atomic_flow_row_id; independent_physical_quantity; exchange_property; exchange_unit; accepted_area; cp_prep; cp_mix; cp_finish | atomic_child_intensity |  |

### Data Quality Requirements

| requirement_id | Applies to | Requirement | Evidence |
| --- | --- | --- | --- |
| dq_gate | accepted_skim | Actual system, thickness, substrate and finish-quality observations plus declared dryness criterion are mandatory; no fixed manufacturer timing proves dryness. | Supplier system sheet; signed zone acceptance and moisture/visual criterion |
| dq_balance | all nodes | Reconcile batches, transfers, stock and water destinations with measurement uncertainty; never back-calculate unmeasured internal quantities merely to close a balance. | Node records, paired transfer ids and documented residuals |

| dq_period | all nodes | Represent the actual site work lot, weather and duration; document missing readings, estimation and temporal/geographic coverage. | Full-period event log and coverage statement |
| dq_ranges | all cards | Provisional ranges are investigation screens only; investigate values outside them and replace with independently reviewed comparable evidence before stronger reuse. | Raw data, explicit uncertainty and independent comparator set |
| atomic_prep_materials | prep; cp_prep | Former prep_materials is a mandatory non-exchange refinement scope and custody/closure ledger key, not a mixed quantity-bearing inventory card. Preserve the original scope: Conditional materials for local joint and edge treatment of the accepted substrate; expand the umbrella into actual identified products.

At this node use the original CP to collect each object's identity/state/medium or receiver, one fixed property/unit, independent quantity/conversion, activation or evidenced absence, source-ledger event, ownership and upstream coverage. The PCR denominator, stock/fate, allocation and closure methods remain unchanged; foreground records cannot choose a different method. Parent totals are non-exchange diagnostics, never copied to children or summed across unlike units as an exchange; do not duplicate a complete formulation/assembly/actual mixed carrier as constituents.

Named children cover only the listed conditional objects; every other real independent object remains required in the actual register. At this node use the original CP to collect each object's identity/state/medium or receiver, one fixed property/unit, independent quantity/conversion, activation or evidenced absence, source-ledger event, ownership and upstream coverage. The PCR denominator, stock/fate, allocation and closure methods remain unchanged; foreground records cannot choose a different method. Parent totals are non-exchange diagnostics, never copied to children or summed across unlike units as an exchange; do not duplicate a complete formulation/assembly/actual mixed carrier as constituents. Incomplete actual roster, quantity, identity/support, method or coverage blocks final foreground completion, never zero, implicit nonapplicability or manifest-only disclosure. | cp_prep; actual_child_register; parent_ledger_id |
| atomic_prep_waste | prep; cp_prep | Former prep_waste is a mandatory non-exchange refinement scope and custody/closure ledger key, not a mixed quantity-bearing inventory card.

The PCR denominator, stock/fate, allocation and closure methods remain unchanged; foreground records cannot choose a different method. Parent totals are non-exchange diagnostics, never copied to children or summed across unlike units as an exchange; do not duplicate a complete formulation/assembly/actual mixed carrier as constituents. Incomplete actual roster, quantity, identity/support, method or coverage blocks final foreground completion, never zero, implicit nonapplicability or manifest-only disclosure. | cp_prep; actual_child_register; parent_ledger_id |
| atomic_mix_reject | mix; cp_mix | Former mix_reject is a mandatory non-exchange refinement scope and custody/closure ledger key, not a mixed quantity-bearing inventory card. Preserve the original scope: Keep stale or contaminated paste out of accepted production; record authorised rework only when supplier instructions permit it. Named children cover only the listed conditional objects; every other real independent object remains required in the actual register. At this node use the original CP to collect each object's identity/state/medium or receiver, one fixed property/unit, independent quantity/conversion, activation or evidenced absence, source-ledger event, ownership and upstream coverage. The PCR denominator, stock/fate, allocation and closure methods remain unchanged; foreground records cannot choose a different method. Parent totals are non-exchange diagnostics, never copied to children or summed across unlike units as an exchange; do not duplicate a complete formulation/assembly/actual mixed carrier as constituents. Incomplete actual roster, quantity, identity/support, method or coverage blocks final foreground completion, never zero, implicit nonapplicability or manifest-only disclosure. | cp_mix; actual_child_register; parent_ledger_id |
| atomic_mix_packaging | mix; cp_mix | Former mix_packaging is a mandatory non-exchange refinement scope and custody/closure ledger key, not a mixed quantity-bearing inventory card. Preserve the original scope: Separate packaging by material and recycling or disposal custodian. Named children cover only the listed conditional objects; every other real independent object remains required in the actual register. At this node use the original CP to collect each object's identity/state/medium or receiver, one fixed property/unit, independent quantity/conversion, activation or evidenced absence, source-ledger event, ownership and upstream coverage. The PCR denominator, stock/fate, allocation and closure methods remain unchanged; foreground records cannot choose a different method.

Incomplete actual roster, quantity, identity/support, method or coverage blocks final foreground completion, never zero, implicit nonapplicability or manifest-only disclosure. | cp_mix; actual_child_register; parent_ledger_id |
| atomic_mix_air | mix; cp_mix | Former mix_air is a mandatory non-exchange refinement scope and custody/closure ledger key, not a mixed quantity-bearing inventory card. Preserve the original scope: Conditional measured particulate, water vapour or other named species only; mixing-stage vapour, when evidenced, belongs here and never at dry_accept; expand species and size fractions rather than assuming one generic dust UUID. Named children cover only the listed conditional objects; every other real independent object remains required in the actual register. At this node use the original CP to collect each object's identity/state/medium or receiver, one fixed property/unit, independent quantity/conversion, activation or evidenced absence, source-ledger event, ownership and upstream coverage. The PCR denominator, stock/fate, allocation and closure methods remain unchanged; foreground records cannot choose a different method. Parent totals are non-exchange diagnostics, never copied to children or summed across unlike units as an exchange; do not duplicate a complete formulation/assembly/actual mixed carrier as constituents. Incomplete actual roster, quantity, identity/support, method or coverage blocks final foreground completion, never zero, implicit nonapplicability or manifest-only disclosure. | cp_mix; actual_child_register; parent_ledger_id |
| atomic_finish_access | finish; cp_finish | Former finish_access is a mandatory non-exchange refinement scope and custody/closure ledger key, not a mixed quantity-bearing inventory card. Preserve the original scope: Record actual access service share, equipment identity and delivery mobilization; avoid duplicated preparation charges. Named children cover only the listed conditional objects; every other real independent object remains required in the actual register. At this node use the original CP to collect each object's identity/state/medium or receiver, one fixed property/unit, independent quantity/conversion, activation or evidenced absence, source-ledger event, ownership and upstream coverage. The PCR denominator, stock/fate, allocation and closure methods remain unchanged; foreground records cannot choose a different method.

Incomplete actual roster, quantity, identity/support, method or coverage blocks final foreground completion, never zero, implicit nonapplicability or manifest-only disclosure. | cp_finish; actual_child_register; parent_ledger_id |
| atomic_finish_waste | finish; cp_finish | Former finish_waste is a mandatory non-exchange refinement scope and custody/closure ledger key, not a mixed quantity-bearing inventory card. Preserve the original scope: Rejected zones return for correction to finish with repeat labour and material retained; removed plaster exits as measured waste and rejected area is excluded from accepted_area. Named children cover only the listed conditional objects; every other real independent object remains required in the actual register. At this node use the original CP to collect each object's identity/state/medium or receiver, one fixed property/unit, independent quantity/conversion, activation or evidenced absence, source-ledger event, ownership and upstream coverage. The PCR denominator, stock/fate, allocation and closure methods remain unchanged; foreground records cannot choose a different method.

Incomplete actual roster, quantity, identity/support, method or coverage blocks final foreground completion, never zero, implicit nonapplicability or manifest-only disclosure. | cp_finish; actual_child_register; parent_ledger_id |
| atomic_legacy_role_mapping | prep; mix; finish; dry_accept | Legacy roles are non-exchange stock, activity, fate or closure keys in the original CP. Independent child exchanges carry quantities; atomic_ requirements retain mandatory remaining-roster refinement and finalization blocks. Original raw fields, helpers and native-unit operands retain their responsibilities and reconcile by child identity and compatible unit, never adding parent totals or unlike units. Source-table Applies-to migration: prep_materials => atomic_prep_materials; prep_access => prep_access_access, atomic_prep_access; prep_waste => atomic_prep_waste; mix_reject => mix_reject_stale, mix_reject_contaminated, atomic_mix_reject; mix_packaging => atomic_mix_packaging; mix_air => mix_air_water_vapour, atomic_mix_air; finish_access => finish_access_access, atomic_finish_access; finish_waste => finish_waste_plaster, atomic_finish_waste | original_protocols; actual_child_register; parent_ledger_id |
| atomic_child_routing | prep; mix; finish; dry_accept | The following routes each child to its original role, node, unique unit and method CP. Independently apply that original role measurement, stock, source/fate, rework, share, conversion and normalization method to each actual identity/state child. Retain the original helper/selector role parameter as legacy_parent_role, but supply quantity operands from this child independent records; ROW_UNIT(child_row_id) is the explicit unit below. Reconcile stocks/transfers only within the same identity/state and compatible native unit, grouping different materials, media, states and units separately. Parent totals are non-exchange diagnostics, never copied as child operands or summed across unlike units. Unsupported original-helper applicability or missing actual conversion, denominator or evidence blocks finalization; field records cannot choose a new method. Original role-named formula operands remain ledger names rather than duplicate exchanges. A cross-unit legacy role executes by this mapping and actual child unit instead of inheriting a wrong fixed unit. Routing: prep_access_access => role=prep_access, node=prep, property=Duration, unit=h, CP=cp_prep; mix_reject_stale => role=mix_reject, node=mix, property=Mass, unit=kg, CP=cp_mix; mix_reject_contaminated => role=mix_reject, node=mix, property=Mass, unit=kg, CP=cp_mix; mix_air_water_vapour => role=mix_air, node=mix, property=Mass, unit=kg, CP=cp_mix; finish_access_access => role=finish_access, node=finish, property=Duration, unit=h, CP=cp_finish; finish_waste_plaster => role=finish_waste, node=finish, property=Mass, unit=kg, CP=cp_finish | actual_child_register; legacy_parent_role; atomic_flow_row_id; independent_physical_quantity; exchange_unit; original_protocols |
| atomic_range_noninheritance | prep_access_access; mix_reject_stale; mix_reject_contaminated; mix_air_water_vapour; finish_access_access; finish_waste_plaster | Retired parent numerical ranges, per-exchange screening instructions and rationales are retained only in implementation audit, applying to neither new child exchanges nor parent-family sums and never proportionally allocated. Each new child has independent evidence needs for actual quantity, identity/state, measurement/conversion, uncertainty and comparable independent observations. Add its own interval only after review confirms applicability to this independent object; never validate a batch with its own maximum. Original ranges of unchanged semantically compatible atomic objects retain their original status. | independent_child_measurement; independent_range_evidence; implementation_range_audit |
| atomic_paired_quantity_provenance | actual internal child source and recipient transfers | Internal I=F is a reconciliation condition for the same actual material/SKU, state, event, custody boundary and gate, never an assignment formula. Each child retains its own actual dispatch quantity and receipt/custody evidence. The same signed custody measurement may be traceably reused without inventing another weighing. Never copy a family total into each child, overwrite a real receipt or force unknown quantities equal. Preserve discrepancies with original values/units, measurement uncertainty, actual transfer loss, state change and responsible-owner evidence; unresolved differences block completion. Internal quantities remain unnormalized physical amounts, divided by the original reference denominator only at each card final step; parent-role sums are QA only. | source_actual_child_quantity; recipient_actual_child_quantity; signed_custody_measurement_id; source_receipt_provenance; paired_quantity_uncertainty; transfer_discrepancy_record; actual_loss_or_state_change_owner; pair_reconciliation_status |

## 9. Validation Rules

| rule_id | Applies to | Rule | source_ids |
| --- | --- | --- | --- |
| validate_reference | accepted_skim | Require positive accepted net area with openings/reveals policy, declared actual system/thickness and final dryness evidence; exclude all unresolved rejects. |  |
| validate_transfers | prep; mix; finish; dry_accept | Match paired interface, paste and set-surface transfer ids and measured quantities; explain handling losses and state changes without forcing equality to final accepted area. |  |
| validate_batch | mix; finish | Require batch/zone links, off-spec paths, wash/changeover ownership and complete attribution; no batch cleaning or failed material may disappear. |  |
| validate_shared | all nodes | Reconcile shared utilities/equipment/mobilization across every consumer and relevant period; identify one owner for every burden and prevent duplicated upstream equipment service. |  |
| validate_rework | finish; dry_accept | Require rejected-zone records and actual correction/discard paths linked to producing node; retain rework burdens while accepted area counts each accepted face once. |  |
| validate_water | mix; finish; dry_accept | Reconcile powder/water/paste and water retention, slurry, condensate and vapour with uncertainty; captured solids/liquid are waste, not invented direct emissions. |  |
| validate_binding | all cards | Verify concrete downstream UUID/support and actual qualifiers; ambiguous preparation, service, waste or pollutant umbrellas require foreground disaggregation and cannot inherit a generic UUID. |  |
| validate_range | all cards | Treat provisional reasoned screens as prompts for investigation, not universal acceptable limits, measured values or substitute inventory. |  |
| close_atomic_prep_materials | prep; cp_prep | Block final foreground completion until every actual object in atomic_prep_materials is reconciled to independent actual child exchanges or evidenced nonactivation. Check one property/unit, independent physical quantity normalized by the original reference denominator, source/fate/period, one burden owner and the original stock/WIP/rework closure. Candidate structural success cannot close this method gate. |  |
| close_atomic_prep_access | prep; cp_prep | Block final foreground completion until every actual object in atomic_prep_access is reconciled to independent actual child exchanges or evidenced nonactivation. Check one property/unit, independent physical quantity normalized by the original reference denominator, source/fate/period, one burden owner and the original stock/WIP/rework closure. Candidate structural success cannot close this method gate. |  |
| close_atomic_prep_waste | prep; cp_prep | Block final foreground completion until every actual object in atomic_prep_waste is reconciled to independent actual child exchanges or evidenced nonactivation. Check one property/unit, independent physical quantity normalized by the original reference denominator, source/fate/period, one burden owner and the original stock/WIP/rework closure. Candidate structural success cannot close this method gate. |  |
| close_atomic_mix_reject | mix; cp_mix | Block final foreground completion until every actual object in atomic_mix_reject is reconciled to independent actual child exchanges or evidenced nonactivation. Check one property/unit, independent physical quantity normalized by the original reference denominator, source/fate/period, one burden owner and the original stock/WIP/rework closure. Candidate structural success cannot close this method gate. |  |
| close_atomic_mix_packaging | mix; cp_mix | Block final foreground completion until every actual object in atomic_mix_packaging is reconciled to independent actual child exchanges or evidenced nonactivation. Check one property/unit, independent physical quantity normalized by the original reference denominator, source/fate/period, one burden owner and the original stock/WIP/rework closure. Candidate structural success cannot close this method gate. |  |
| close_atomic_mix_air | mix; cp_mix | Block final foreground completion until every actual object in atomic_mix_air is reconciled to independent actual child exchanges or evidenced nonactivation. Check one property/unit, independent physical quantity normalized by the original reference denominator, source/fate/period, one burden owner and the original stock/WIP/rework closure. Candidate structural success cannot close this method gate. |  |
| close_atomic_finish_access | finish; cp_finish | Block final foreground completion until every actual object in atomic_finish_access is reconciled to independent actual child exchanges or evidenced nonactivation. Check one property/unit, independent physical quantity normalized by the original reference denominator, source/fate/period, one burden owner and the original stock/WIP/rework closure. Candidate structural success cannot close this method gate. |  |
| close_atomic_finish_waste | finish; cp_finish | Block final foreground completion until every actual object in atomic_finish_waste is reconciled to independent actual child exchanges or evidenced nonactivation. Check one property/unit, independent physical quantity normalized by the original reference denominator, source/fate/period, one burden owner and the original stock/WIP/rework closure. Candidate structural success cannot close this method gate. |  |
| atomic_pair_provenance_complete | actual internal child source and recipient transfers | Verify actual source/receipt evidence, original physical quantities/units and ownership for the same material/state/event/gate. Traceable reuse of the same signed measurement is allowed; copied parent totals, overwritten receipts and forced unknown equality are prohibited. Unexplained differences without uncertainty, actual loss or state-transition responsibility evidence block completion; verify exactly one normalization per card. |  |
