# Existing hospital negative-pressure source-isolation suite envelope, services retrofit and validation services


## 1. Scope and Applicability

This PCR covers the completed envelope and building-services retrofit of one source-negative isolation suite in a retained hospital: patient bedroom, entry lobby and en-suite form one coordinated accepted intervention. Survey actual adjacent clinical use, retained capacities, constraints and approved multidisciplinary scope. NHS HBN 04-01 Supplement 1 (July 2025 posting, internally 2024 revision) supports route and test logic in England; actual local standards and approved deviations govern elsewhere and on each project. It provides no category-wide default ACH, Pa, service life, test consumption or kill rate.

Whole new-building methodology starts at a different condition and does not own contaminated retained-system release, hidden-envelope first-fix testing or the negative-source suite validation chain. Fan installation, sealing and cleaning are constituent tasks, not equivalent accepted suite services. Protective-positive and neutral-bedroom PPVL designs, whole wards, portable HEPA-only arrangements and later clinical use are outside this category.

| actual_state_exits | all processes | Before final data MUST instantiate usable historic removed fabric as a separate Product output in its actual native unit, with historical_receiver, historical_transfer and quality acceptance; do not merge it with unused new-supply returns or credit new purchases. Instantiate volume-measured contained effluent as a separate Waste exchange with volume unit and receiver. Instantiate actual direct water abstraction/environmental discharge as separate Elementary input/output with actual source/receiving medium, volume state and destination; do not hide these in Mass cards. Mass waste/species cards cover only their corresponding mass ledgers; whole-fluid and species views remain nonadditive. |  |
| power_boundary | clearance_electricity; envelope_services_electricity; finishing_electricity; validation_electricity | Record gross imported and gross exported electricity, actual source/retained on-site generation, construction/test circulation and losses separately under one event owner. Never net exports or future operating savings against imports. MUST instantiate any actual export as a separate measured Product output and receiver; actual generation needs its fuel/asset/releases and complete provider coverage once. |  |
| scope_start | all processes | Start with surveyed retained hospital suite, adjoining occupied clinical zones and retained-system condition; clinical/IPC teams own decanting, decontamination/release and containment approval; estates own isolation and safe old gas/water/electrical/ventilation handoff. Attribute all actual temporary clinical-continuity/containment resources. No new purchase or negative credit for the historic building. | nhs-isolation-hbn0401-supp1-2025 |
| sequence_gate | envelope_services; finishing; validation | Permanent slab-to-slab, facade, penetration, door/window and service sealing is checked at first-fix before concealment by ceilings, finishes or covers; repair and repeat the test before release to finishing. Final leakage and commissioning/validation follow finished installation; air sealers do not validate their own leakage work under the adopted NHS protocol. | nhs-isolation-hbn0401-supp1-2025 |
| negative_gate | validation | Use only the approved source-negative design: bedroom negative to lobby/corridor and en-suite negative to bedroom, with actual lobby strategy, airflow directions, stabiliser steady response, fan fault signals, gauges, pressure monitoring/alarms and actual water/fire/interface checks. Record actual adopted jurisdictional design criteria and authorised deviations. NHS England recommendations, example ACH/Pa and fire ratings are not universal defaults. | nhs-isolation-hbn0401-supp1-2025 |
| complete_resources | all processes | Own actual direct and provider/rental labour-support materials, temporary utility connections, travel/freight, tests, cleaning, spare parts, repeat works and shared asset lifecycle burdens once. A provider row needs an actual completed physical result, native quantity and full upstream coverage. Missing coverage blocks a final dataset, including undisclosed offsite work. |  |
| expand_actual | all processes | MUST expand umbrellas to concrete SKU/provider/species exchanges before final data. Preserve native Count/Area/Length/Volume/Mass supply and matched usable returns. Fuel, direct water abstraction and actual direct water/gas emissions require dedicated measured exchanges with their state and medium; do not hide them in service or waste cards. No assumed pathogen kg, VOC fraction, refrigerant loss, gas venting or wastewater fate. |  |
| scope_end | all processes | End at signed complete intervention after defect closure and project-required independent competent validation, with actual VSG/Authorising Engineer and hospital clinical/IPC/estates responsibilities documented. Exclude new whole hospital, whole ward, protective-positive/PPVL, portable HEPA-only provision, clinical treatment/equipment and later routine care, maintenance or annual verification. This is no promise of infection prevention or patient outcome. | nhs-isolation-hbn0401-supp1-2025 |

| single_suite | N is positive count of unique complete accepted suite IDs. One bedroom+lobby+en-suite is one intervention, regardless of trades, rooms, beds, attempts or time. Failures, removed rejects, rework/retests and all losses retain burden; no accepted output until closed. Recoverable fabric exits by documented destination without speculative substitution credits. |  |
| stock_ownership | S = attributed opening stock + external net-of-tare receipts - carried closing stock. Internal issues or installed activity are not new receipts. Choose gross supply with matched outward usable returns OR consumed-only with the return deducted once; disclose choice. Nonreturned waste/loss stays upstream; closing stock is not a return. Historic removed fabric has no new supply credit. |  |
| shared_lifecycle | Identify temporary containment, access, testing and rented assets, all consumers across clearance/envelope_services/finishing/validation and ALL other jobs/nodes/periods. Allocate full manufacture, maintenance, replacements and end-of-life with compatible actual job_driver / full_life_driver. Full life uses observed completed life or observed history plus evidenced remainder/replacement/termination/end-of-life, with sources, uncertainty, sensitivity and updates. Choose asset-equivalent quantity (job_driver/full_life_driver)/N OR lifecycle-complete service quantity job_driver/N with matching per-driver burden. Do not combine views or normalize twice; no invented lifespan. |  |
| periods | Index clearance, first-fix before concealment, finishing, commissioning, rework and final validation/acceptance by actual phase/period/event. Attribute each shared receipt, test and replacement once across reporting boundaries; reconcile transfers/opening/closing stock before aggregation. Unresolved termination or replacement coverage blocks finalization; do not annualize construction to a service life. |  |

### Calculation Rules

| rule_id | Applies to | Formula or rule | Inputs | Output | source_ids |
| --- | --- | --- | --- | --- | --- |
| normalize_native | all inventory rows | For each actual concrete exchange, divide attributed job quantity by N once; final suite output is 1 Item(s). Keep raw numerator and N. | native_quantity; N; cp_clearance; cp_envelope_services; cp_finishing; cp_validation | Native exchange per reference flow |  |
| stock_balance | all inventory rows | S = attributed opening stock + external net-of-tare receipts - carried closing stock. Internal issues or installed activity are not new receipts. Choose gross supply with matched outward usable returns OR consumed-only with the return deducted once; disclose choice. Nonreturned waste/loss stays upstream; closing stock is not a return. Historic removed fabric has no new supply credit. | opening_stock; external_receipts; tare; carried_closing_stock; usable_outward_return | Reconciled supply and matched return ledger |  |
| fuel_fates | all inventory rows | If fuel is actually used, supply upstream and burned fuel are distinct. Obtain measured burn OR an audited complete disjoint native-unit fate balance with uncertainty and unknown-loss investigation. Returned fuel, nonburned waste, uncontained loss and carried closing are mutually exclusive; total spill is audit only and recovered closing is already closing. Never infer burn as an unexplained residual. | measured_burn; external_receipts; opening_stock; usable_outward_return; nonburned_waste; uncontained_loss; carried_closing_stock; total_spill_audit; recovered_closing_stock | Evidence-based actual burn and other disjoint fates |  |
| species_release | actual exchanges required by `refine_clearance_actual_releases`; actual exchanges required by `refine_envelope_services_actual_releases`; actual exchanges required by `refine_finishing_actual_releases`; actual exchanges required by `refine_validation_actual_releases` | Use measured species mass OR actual matched activity times species factor OR actual whole-fluid release times evidenced composition and receiving-medium fate. Do not multiply a complete species factor by composition/fate again. Whole-fluid view is nonadditive to species; SDS, safety limits and no-VOC claims are not emission quantities. | native_quantity; activity; species_factor; composition; fate; receiving_medium; factor_source; composition_source; fate_source | Actual species mass by medium per reference flow |  |
| freight_work | clearance_freight; envelope_services_freight; finishing_freight; validation_freight | Sum actual load_mass in kg times distance in km for each leg / N; disclose carrier empty-return and upstream coverage and avoid adding fuel already covered in freight. | load_mass; load_mass_unit; distance; distance_unit; empty_return_scope; N | Freight in kg*km per reference flow |  |
| shared_asset | actual exchanges required by `refine_clearance_provider_assets`; actual exchanges required by `refine_envelope_services_provider_assets`; actual exchanges required by `refine_finishing_provider_assets`; actual exchanges required by `refine_validation_provider_assets` | Identify temporary containment, access, testing and rented assets, all consumers across clearance/envelope_services/finishing/validation and ALL other jobs/nodes/periods. Allocate full manufacture, maintenance, replacements and end-of-life with compatible actual job_driver / full_life_driver. Full life uses observed completed life or observed history plus evidenced remainder/replacement/termination/end-of-life, with sources, uncertainty, sensitivity and updates. Choose asset-equivalent quantity (job_driver/full_life_driver)/N OR lifecycle-complete service quantity job_driver/N with matching per-driver burden. Do not combine views or normalize twice; no invented lifespan. | job_driver; full_life_driver; driver_unit; observed_life; evidenced_remainder; replacement; termination; end_of_life; N | One lifecycle-complete attributable asset or service view |  |

### Data Quality Requirements

| requirement_id | Applies to | Requirement | Evidence |
| --- | --- | --- | --- |
| identity | all inventory rows | Verify concrete SKU/provider/substance, type/direction/state/gate/property/unit and support rows before final exchange; actual umbrellas are not fixed identities. | Detail rows and actual specifications |
| completeness | all inventory rows | Cover all actual phases, providers, temporary clinical continuity and shared life; record zero with evidence, unknown with blocker, and measurement uncertainty. | Coverage matrix, native records, asset life and scope reconciliation |
| gate | accepted_suite | Keep first-fix before-concealment and final independent test evidence distinct; actual hospital signatories own their responsibilities and no clinical-outcome extrapolation is allowed. | Dated tests and signed gate record |
| `refine_clearance_consumables` | `clearance_consumables_bag`; `clearance_consumables_seal` | Preserve this actual collection and closure scope as a mandatory dataset-production requirement: Expand actual SKU-specific consumables, PPE, bags, seals, test materials and spares used in this node; capture separate native exchanges where not supplied by mass. Range evidence need: Record actual node-specific consumable/PPE/seal/test/spare SKU, native supplied quantity, tare/opening/closing/matched usable returns, rejected-work consumption and measurement uncertainty; no default material use per suite. Independently establish every actual identity, state, real provider/receiver and exactly one exchange property/unit before constructing its flow card. Each actual exchange requires its own recorded quantity and applicable method, uncertainty and custody/fate coverage. Auxiliary CP units do not authorize extra exchange views. Actual occurrence unknown is not zero; never invent a material/species/provider list or split a parent total. Quantitative screening evidence must fit each actual exchange; a former family interval cannot be copied or divided into child ranges. Further actual identities not fully specified by the conditional children require mandatory refinement and prevent dataset completion; this requirement is not itself a flow exchange. Actual other consumable/PPE/test material/spare SKUs and nonmass native references require separate identities and independent quantities. Preserve node ownership, issue/stock/matched returns, rejected work and uncertainty. | `cp_clearance`; actual independent records and identity/unit evidence |
| `refine_clearance_provider_assets` | actual independently refined exchanges | Preserve this actual collection and closure scope as a mandatory dataset-production requirement: Expand completed provider physical results and temporary clinical continuity, containment/access, test and rental assets actually used. Match each native quantity to complete upstream scope; money or labour hours cannot become a counted completed service. Range evidence need: For each actual completed provider result record native service quantity/gate and upstream coverage; for shared assets record the chosen whole-asset or complete-life service view, compatible job/all-consumer full-life drivers, observed history/remainder/replacement/termination/EOL sources and uncertainty/sensitivity/update. No price/hour-to-Count or assumed life. Independently establish every actual identity, state, real provider/receiver and exactly one exchange property/unit before constructing its flow card. Each actual exchange requires its own recorded quantity and applicable method, uncertainty and custody/fate coverage. Auxiliary CP units do not authorize extra exchange views. Actual occurrence unknown is not zero; never invent a material/species/provider list or split a parent total. Quantitative screening evidence must fit each actual exchange; a former family interval cannot be copied or divided into child ranges. Further actual identities not fully specified by the conditional children require mandatory refinement and prevent dataset completion; this requirement is not itself a flow exchange. Actual complete provider function/reference/gate and uncovered resources; shared whole-asset versus compatible complete-life service view, all consumers/history/remainder/replacements/EOL/uncertainty. No money/hour-to-Count or arbitrary life. | `cp_clearance`; actual independent records and identity/unit evidence |
| `refine_clearance_usable_returns` | actual independently refined exchanges | Preserve this actual collection and closure scope as a mandatory dataset-production requirement: Only actual usable outward returns matched by SKU, state and original receipt enter; retain the same native unit as supply. Closing carried stock is not an outward return. Range evidence need: Record actual outward transfer quantity, receiving acceptance and usable condition in the matching supplied SKU/native unit; disclose gross-with-outlets or consumed-only accounting. Closing stock and usable historically removed fabric are different records; no generic return rate or credit. Independently establish every actual identity, state, real provider/receiver and exactly one exchange property/unit before constructing its flow card. Each actual exchange requires its own recorded quantity and applicable method, uncertainty and custody/fate coverage. Auxiliary CP units do not authorize extra exchange views. Actual occurrence unknown is not zero; never invent a material/species/provider list or split a parent total. Quantitative screening evidence must fit each actual exchange; a former family interval cannot be copied or divided into child ranges. Further actual identities not fully specified by the conditional children require mandatory refinement and prevent dataset completion; this requirement is not itself a flow exchange. Actual outward usable product matched to SKU/state/original receipt/native property/unit/receiver; original gross-with-outlets or consumed-only bridge, closing stock and historic removed fabric excluded. | `cp_clearance`; actual independent records and identity/unit evidence |
| `refine_clearance_contained_waste` | `clearance_contained_waste_spent_filter`; `clearance_contained_waste_contained_effluent` | Preserve this actual collection and closure scope as a mandatory dataset-production requirement: Expand measured waste by material, contamination/hazard status and actual receiving treatment; packaging, retained old fabric removed and used filters/PPE are distinguished from new-material losses. Contained effluent uses its actual native volume where measured. Range evidence need: Measure actual segregated material/contamination/state, tare-corrected waste quantity and receiver/treatment/transport coverage, keeping old versus new origins. Independently measure native-Volume effluent Waste; no default waste ratio, recovery yield or forced mass conversion. Independently establish every actual identity, state, real provider/receiver and exactly one exchange property/unit before constructing its flow card. Each actual exchange requires its own recorded quantity and applicable method, uncertainty and custody/fate coverage. Auxiliary CP units do not authorize extra exchange views. Actual occurrence unknown is not zero; never invent a material/species/provider list or split a parent total. Quantitative screening evidence must fit each actual exchange; a former family interval cannot be copied or divided into child ranges. Further actual identities not fully specified by the conditional children require mandatory refinement and prevent dataset completion; this requirement is not itself a flow exchange. Actual segregated packaging, historically removed fabric, PPE and other new-material losses require separate concrete material/whole-composite/hazard/state/receiver identities. Never force volume effluent into mass or count captured mixture as direct release. | `cp_clearance`; actual independent records and identity/unit evidence |
| `refine_clearance_actual_releases` | actual independently refined exchanges | Preserve this actual collection and closure scope as a mandatory dataset-production requirement: Expand only actual measured substances and receiving media, or valid matched activity/species factors. Include actual combustion, coating/cleaning, refrigerant or medical-gas releases if present. An infection risk is not a measured pathogen emission; sealed waste is not an elementary release. Range evidence need: Require actual event/substance/particle fraction/receiving medium and measured species mass, or matched activity with valid factor units/source, or measured whole-fluid release with evidenced composition/fate and uncertainty. Captured waste and whole-fluid/species audit views are separate; no pathogen quantity from infection risk or default leakage/emission factor. Independently establish every actual identity, state, real provider/receiver and exactly one exchange property/unit before constructing its flow card.

## 9. Validation Rules

| rule_id | applies_to | Rule | source_ids |
| --- | --- | --- | --- |
| acceptance | foreground_dataset_conformance | Reject premature acceptance, missing suite components, unknown mode, omitted first-fix evidence, self-validation where independence is required, unapproved deviations or open defects. Retain calibrated raw airflow/pressure/leakage, test conditions, first-fix/final timestamps, stabiliser and fan-fault/monitor/alarm/gauge results, water/fire/interfaces, actual independent validator scope and signed multidisciplinary release. | nhs-isolation-hbn0401-supp1-2025 |
| inventory_complete | foreground_dataset_conformance | Reconcile native receipts, stock, returns, installation and waste; separate historic removed fabric, packaging and new-material rejects. Every actual zero requires evidence, every unknown remains a gap. Verify concrete identities/property/unit upstream coverage and provider assets; expand direct water/gas/species exchanges. Check fuel fates, species factors, freight units and all shared-life consumers; no double counting or unsupported credits. |  |
| comparability | foreground_dataset_conformance | Compare only disclosed actual suite layout/volume, adjoining occupancy, retained capacities, adopted standards, mode, test convention, phasing and scope; normalize once by N. Quantities, thresholds, durations and species are project evidence, not defaults from guidance. Missing native-property support or data coverage prevents final data even if a candidate structural check passes. |  |

| `validate_atomic_exchange_unit_and_normalization` | all inventory rows | Each concrete flow card identifies exactly one actual independently supplied product/SKU/formulation, complete assembly, complete single-function or genuine complete bounded provider service, actual waste composite/state/receiver, or substance/size/receiving medium, with exactly one property and unit. Different actual identities require independent quantities and records, not a summed family exchange. A complete product/carrier includes its contents once. Same unchanged SKU/state usable supply/return pairs and matched physical internal send/receive pairs use the same selected property/unit; kg and count or MJ and kWh auxiliaries are nonadditive measurements, never duplicate exchanges. Missing identity/occurrence/quantity/native reference is a gap, not zero. An asset-equivalent formula already ending in division by N, D or A is the final quantity per reference flow. Its complete-life fraction and accepted-output normalization constitute the same normalization operation as the general normalization rule; never divide it by that denominator again. Apply the complete-life upstream burden exactly once. Actual complete provider event counts remain event quantities, not owned-asset fractions. |  |
