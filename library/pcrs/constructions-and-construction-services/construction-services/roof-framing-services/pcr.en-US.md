# Braced metal-plate-connected timber roof-truss erection services

## 1. Scope and Applicability

This PCR covers first erection of a declared factory-made metal-plate-connected timber roof-truss set on accepted existing bearing structures. The output is the complete qualified erection-stage service: the specified trusses positioned and connected, required permanent individual-member restraints and bracing installed, and temporary system stability documented and retained where needed. It is neither one loose factory truss nor complete roof-building performance. CPC 3.0 54522 includes truss framing; this PCR covers a narrower timber-truss route, excluding stick framing and metal trusses (`un-cpc3-2025`).

The actual truss design drawings, placement documents, current jobsite package, accepted bearing interfaces and engineer-approved erection, temporary-stability and permanent-bracing plans are mandatory foreground evidence. SBCA's public 2023 article establishes the installation sequence; its numerical prescriptions are not universal design values. The current BCSI landing page identifies the revised 2025 edition; citing that page does not establish access to the full guide. Record the editions and applicability of instructions actually used (`sbca-installation-2023`; `sbca-bcsi-current`; `sbca-jobsite-packages`).

Exclude factory manufacture; site cutting, notching or drilling of trusses; unapproved repairs; floor trusses; wall/bearing construction; roof sheathing, diaphragm construction, covering and waterproofing; MEP loading; building use and demolition. Suspect trusses are quarantined for manufacturer/engineer disposition. Authorized structural repair requires a separate reviewed boundary. Pre-sized specified braces and connectors are installed in this route; an independent site-fabrication operation requires boundary review.

## 4. Measurement and Unit Rules

| rule_id | Applies to | Required property | Required unit | Rule |
| --- | --- | --- | --- | --- |
| `counted_set_reference` | reference product | Number of items | Item(s) | One accepted complete set is 1 Item(s). Individual truss count is a qualifier and input quantity, never the reference set count; no conversion from roof area, timber mass or one truss is allowed without explicit set records. |
| `material_mass_evidence` | roof_trusses; `permanent_bracing_restraint`; `permanent_bracing_bracing`; `permanent_bracing_reinforcement`; `bearing_connectors_hanger`; `bearing_connectors_bearing_connection`; `transport_packaging_wrapping`; `transport_packaging_strap`; `transport_packaging_dunnage`; `reusable_returns_timber_bracing`; `reusable_returns_hanger`; `erection_waste_truss`; `erection_waste_timber_bracing` | Mass | kg | Retain actual counted pieces and material-specific measured/supplier net masses. Geometry does not supply timber density or moisture correction; any count-to-mass conversion needs actual configuration-specific records. Keep mixed materials and waste destinations separate. |
| `service_unit_evidence` | temporary_stability_service; `lifting_access_service_crane`; `lifting_access_service_hoisting`; `lifting_access_service_access`; logistics; installation_energy; actual exchanges required by `refine_direct_fuel` | Actual service property | h; t*km; kWh; kg | Preserve the measured service/fuel/energy units and provider boundary. Hours cannot replace fuel or asset manufacture. Any conversion requires the actual factor, unit and measured basis; never infer fuel from lift count or nominal capacity. |


## 5. System Boundary

### Boundary Abstraction

| Field | Value |
| --- | --- |
| declared_starting_condition | Factory-complete identified timber trusses and specified installation components at their declared supply gate, with existing bearings accepted for the actual package and lifting access available |
| starting_condition_role | Foreground erection boundary; host readiness is a documented interface, not a zero-burden substitute for construction in a whole-building model |
| product_classification_scope | Narrower timber-truss erection subset of CPC 3.0 54522; separate from roof coverings under 54530 |
| recursive_input_rule | Record factory trusses as component products, not as this erection service. If a previously erected set or subcontracted erection service enters the package, disclose its completed scope and prevent repeating the same erection or resource burden; a relocation is outside first erection. |
| upstream_dataset_requirement | Use actual supply-gate truss/component and resource datasets with declared packaging, freight, energy and temporary-asset coverage. Include upstream manufacture through these inputs; do not recreate factory production in the site node. |
| disclosure | Declare supplied-kit coverage, excluded host/diaphragm work, physical state and responsibilities at the erection gate, all shared consumers and periods, and temporary-support production/use/removal coverage and later owner. Unresolved stability or service coverage blocks a completed dataset. |

### Boundary Rules

| `document_and_host_gate` | roof_truss_erection | Before erection, reconcile actual truss design/placement/jobsite documents, approved erection/bracing plans and accepted bearings; resolve conflicts through the responsible designer/manufacturer. Record project-specific applicability rather than importing public article dimensions or tolerances. | `sbca-installation-2023`; `sbca-bcsi-current`; `sbca-jobsite-packages` |
| `erection_components` | roof_truss_erection | Own finished trusses, additional bearing fasteners/hangers, permanent brace/restraint members and their fixings, temporary-stability service, lifting/access, installation energy, freight, actual auxiliary consumption, packaging and correction losses. Identify which items are already in the supplied kit to avoid counting them twice. | `sbca-installation-2023`; `sbca-bcsi-current`; `sbca-jobsite-packages` |
| `erection_gate` | erected_roof_truss_set | Handover requires every specified truss positioned, securely connected at its accepted bearings, required permanent individual-member restraints/bracing installed, closed inspection findings and signed responsibility transfer. This is an erection-stage gate; do not claim complete roof load, weather, fire or thermal performance. | `sbca-installation-2023`; `sbca-bcsi-current`; `sbca-jobsite-packages` |
| `retained_temporary_stability` | temporary_stability_service | Where a later diaphragm is needed, retain required temporary restraint. Index erection, post-handover continuation, later stability confirmation and authorized removal/return; name custody and removal owner at each change. A bounded service must include or explicitly link asset production, installation, maintenance/use, replacement, removal, return transport and end-of-use treatment; it cannot erase these burdens. | `sbca-installation-2023`; `sbca-bcsi-current`; `sbca-jobsite-packages` |
| `external_repair_boundary` | roof_truss_erection | Placement/connection corrections loop within this node with their full resource burdens. Damaged, unsuitable or altered trusses remain quarantined; return or characterize their waste exit. Cutting/notching/drilling trusses and structural repair are not admitted operations in this PCR. | `sbca-installation-2023`; `sbca-bcsi-current`; `sbca-jobsite-packages` |
| `resource_and_release_boundary` | roof_truss_erection | For crane, access, temporary bracing and freight, identify full provider coverage and every actual consumer/period, including other work packages. If the provider includes operation fuel/emissions, do not add the same operation again. For directly controlled equipment collect fuel, energy and characterized direct releases separately; no unmeasured zero assumption. |  |


## 6. Process Inventory Structure

### Process Map

| process_id | process_name | inclusion | inclusion_condition | role | quantitative_reference |
| --- | --- | --- | --- | --- | --- |
| `roof_truss_erection` | Roof-truss placement, anchoring and braced erection-stage handover | required | Actual first erection of the declared factory timber roof-truss set on accepted bearings | Integrate finished trusses, bearing connectors and permanent braces; install/retain temporary stability; own erection corrections and disposition exits | 1 Item(s) accepted complete erection-stage set |

One node owns receipt, handling, sequential lifting/placement, fastening/bracing, inspections and local placement/fixing corrections. These operations produce one independently handed-over service, not artificial intermediate products. The site operator does not fabricate trusses. Suspect components leave this node through `rejected_truss_returns` or `erection_waste_truss`; `erection_waste_timber_bracing`; genuine unused materials/packaging use `reusable_returns_timber_bracing`; `reusable_returns_hanger`. Temporary-asset returns already covered by their service stay inside that service boundary.

## 7. Allocation and Co-product Handling

| rule_id | Applies to | Rule | source_ids |
| --- | --- | --- | --- |
| `single_accepted_service` | roof_truss_erection | There is one intended accepted erection service. Do not allocate to the existing bearing structure or later roof covering as a co-product. Rejected trusses, waste and returns are not accepted erection output; retain all attributable failed-attempt and replacement burdens. |  |
| `local_corrections_and_exits` | roof_truss_erection | Local repositioning/refastening repeats within this node. Link each correction to the original event and retain its extra materials, power and equipment. Link quarantine to product return or waste exit with actual receiver/status. Retained stock is reconciled separately; gross inputs, stock and returns must not be netted twice. No default recycling or biogenic-carbon credit is awarded. | `sbca-installation-2023` |
| `shared_resource_attribution` | temporary_stability_service; `lifting_access_service_crane`; `lifting_access_service_hoisting`; `lifting_access_service_access`; logistics; installation_energy; actual exchanges required by `refine_direct_fuel` | Identify asset/service IDs, roof_truss_erection and every other consuming work package or reporting period. Prefer separately metered activity and directly attributable trips; split inseparable common burdens by a documented causal driver suited to the actual resource, retaining the whole consumer denominator, standby/mobilization treatment and sensitivity. Record rejected alternatives and inventory coverage; do not divide by this PCR output alone when other consumers exist. |  |
| `support_phase_attribution` | temporary_stability_service | Index P1 erection to signed gate, P2 retained support pending the separately owned diaphragm/stability gate, and P3 authorized removal/return/end-of-use. Attach each asset, replacement, maintenance, transport and removal event to its actual phase and consumer. Allocate production and termination burdens once across the documented service cycle; phase shares and receiving dataset responsibilities must reconcile to that whole cycle. Provider ownership does not remove burdens. Missing termination owner or service coverage blocks finalization. | `sbca-bcsi-current` |
| `provider_and_direct_operations` | `lifting_access_service_crane`; `lifting_access_service_hoisting`; `lifting_access_service_access`; temporary_stability_service; logistics; installation_energy; actual exchanges required by `refine_direct_fuel`; actual exchanges required by `refine_direct_releases` | For each actual provider boundary, choose service-inclusive inventory or underlying disaggregated operation. Explicitly mark which fuel, electricity, asset and release burdens are included and which require separate exchanges. Counting service duration alone is insufficient. Material returns already included inside a service must not appear again as separate return outputs. |  |

Record each actual child/refined exchange independently by identity, physical event, state, gate and period. Retain all original obligations even where a corresponding exchange identity is not yet known. Do not allocate a family total or copy its numerical Range to children, count a carrier and its contained material twice, or turn missing occurrence/quantity/native reference into zero.

Distinguish fuel and electricity, include compressor/tools and correction events, and allocate shared operation using measured consumption or documented causal use with complete denominator; record factors for any actual conversion. Record each actual child/refined exchange independently by identity, physical event, state, gate and period. Retain all original obligations even where a corresponding exchange identity is not yet known. Do not allocate a family total or copy its numerical Range to children, count a carrier and its contained material twice, or turn missing occurrence/quantity/native reference into zero.

Reconcile usable return dispatch to receiving custody; quarantine rejected trusses until written disposition; use waste tickets for discarded material. Keep retained stock and service-internal asset returns separate, with gross supply and stock/return adjustment made once. Record each actual child/refined exchange independently by identity, physical event, state, gate and period. Retain all original obligations even where a corresponding exchange identity is not yet known. Do not allocate a family total or copy its numerical Range to children, count a carrier and its contained material twice, or turn missing occurrence/quantity/native reference into zero.

### Calculation Rules

| rule_id | Applies to | Formula or rule | Inputs | Output | source_ids |
| --- | --- | --- | --- | --- | --- |
| `normalize_complete_set` | all inventory rows | Aggregate actual attributable material, resource, residual and service quantities for the declared complete package; where one measured campaign covers several accepted sets, retain each configuration and allocate with its actual records before expressing quantities per reference flow. Do not divide individual truss counts into a new reference product. | actual records; accepted complete set ledger; allocation evidence | per reference flow inventory quantities |  |
| `component_closure` | roof_trusses; `permanent_bracing_restraint`; `permanent_bracing_bracing`; `permanent_bracing_reinforcement`; `bearing_connectors_hanger`; `bearing_connectors_bearing_connection`; `transport_packaging_wrapping`; `transport_packaging_strap`; `transport_packaging_dunnage`; `reusable_returns_timber_bracing`; `reusable_returns_hanger`; rejected_truss_returns; `erection_waste_truss`; `erection_waste_timber_bracing` | Reconcile opening stock plus receipts to installed/consumed quantities, genuine product returns, characterized waste and closing stock by actual material or truss ID. Record unresolved balance gaps and correction supply explicitly; do not use an output service count as a material mass. | cp_components; cp_residuals | material-specific count/mass reconciliation |  |
| `shared_cycle_closure` | temporary_stability_service; `lifting_access_service_crane`; `lifting_access_service_hoisting`; `lifting_access_service_access`; logistics; installation_energy; actual exchanges required by `refine_direct_fuel` | For each event/resource, apply its evidenced allocation share to the full covered inventory, not just billed hours. Reconcile all consumer and P1/P2/P3 shares to the complete resource/service boundary, then retain each accepted set attribution once. | cp_services; cp_logistics; cp_resources; all-consumer and phase ledger | complete allocated underlying burden with service activity |  |
| `release_calculation` | actual exchanges required by `refine_direct_releases` | Use measured released mass or actual measured activity with a source-specific documented factor, retaining unit conversion, capture assumptions and uncertainty. List the actual external factor reference in the constructed dataset; do not invent a factor in this PCR. | cp_releases; actual activity/factor or measurements | substance- and compartment-specific released mass |  |

### Data Quality Requirements

| requirement_id | Applies to | Requirement | Evidence |

| `supply_and_quantity_quality` | all component and residual cards | Retain material identity and state, actual gross/stock/return amounts, net mass/count evidence, moisture basis and uncertainty. Candidate numerical ranges require independently reviewed comparable evidence; a batch maximum cannot validate itself. | cp_components; cp_residuals |
| `phase_and_service_completeness` | temporary_stability_service; `lifting_access_service_crane`; `lifting_access_service_hoisting`; `lifting_access_service_access` | Declare P1/P2/P3 dates/owners and full service coverage; reconcile capital materials, maintenance/use, replacements and termination once across all consumers. Unconfirmed later removal is a gap rather than zero. | cp_services; provider inventory; responsibility transfer |
| `resource_release_quality` | installation_energy; actual exchanges required by `refine_direct_fuel`; actual exchanges required by `refine_direct_releases`; logistics | Use actual supply, fuel, technology/mode and receiving media; retain meter/stock/distance evidence and applicable factors. Disclose unmeasured resources/releases and provider exclusions. | cp_resources; cp_releases; cp_logistics |
| `identity_and_range_gaps` | all cards | Resolve each concrete exchange identity, support property/unit and actual-evidence Range needs before final TIDAS publication. A conditional umbrella becomes zero, one or several exchanges from foreground evidence; absence of evidence is not zero. | actual lookup/support verification and foreground collection package |
| `refine_permanent_bracing` | `permanent_bracing_restraint`; `permanent_bracing_bracing`; `permanent_bracing_reinforcement` | Preserve this actual collection and closure scope as a mandatory dataset-production requirement: Include the actual members and reinforcements installed at this erection gate. Separate components supplied in the truss kit from additional purchases; no site transformation of trusses is permitted. Range evidence need: Actual engineer-approved brace schedule, pieces and measured/supplier masses are needed; no generic brace spacing, timber density, loss fraction or force capacity is supplied. Independently establish every actual identity, state, real provider/receiver and exactly one exchange property/unit before constructing its flow card. Each actual exchange requires its own recorded quantity and applicable method, uncertainty and custody/fate coverage. Auxiliary CP units do not authorize extra exchange views. Actual occurrence unknown is not zero; never invent a material/species/provider list or split a parent total. Quantitative screening evidence must fit each actual exchange; a former family interval cannot be copied or divided into child ranges. Further actual identities not fully specified by the conditional children require mandatory refinement and prevent dataset completion; this requirement is not itself a flow exchange. Actual different design/grade/SKU members require own records; a physical member serving several roles is counted once, kit-included members not bought again, no site transformation of trusses. | `cp_components`; actual independent records and identity/unit evidence |
| `refine_bearing_connectors` | `bearing_connectors_hanger`; `bearing_connectors_bearing_connection` | Preserve this actual collection and closure scope as a mandatory dataset-production requirement: Record actual hangers, bearing connections, brace fixings and fasteners not already included in the factory product or other service input.

Range evidence need: Obtain actual approved connection schedule and item-specific mass evidence; no standard nail count, anchor capacity or generic steel substitution is valid. Independently establish every actual identity, state, real provider/receiver and exactly one exchange property/unit before constructing its flow card. Each actual exchange requires its own recorded quantity and applicable method, uncertainty and custody/fate coverage. Auxiliary CP units do not authorize extra exchange views. Actual occurrence unknown is not zero; never invent a material/species/provider list or split a parent total. Quantitative screening evidence must fit each actual exchange; a former family interval cannot be copied or divided into child ranges. Further actual identities not fully specified by the conditional children require mandatory refinement and prevent dataset completion; this requirement is not itself a flow exchange. Actual brace-fixing and other fastener functions/SKUs/material/corrosion-protection identities need separate records; factory product/provider included components not duplicated. | `cp_components`; actual independent records and identity/unit evidence |
| `refine_lifting_access_service` | `lifting_access_service_crane`; `lifting_access_service_hoisting`; `lifting_access_service_access` | Preserve this actual collection and closure scope as a mandatory dataset-production requirement: Identify actual crane/rigging, hoisting and access systems serving the erection. For each provider disclose included mobilization, equipment production/maintenance, operation and demobilization; separate direct-operation inputs only when absent from that service. Range evidence need: Obtain actual lift plan and equipment/service logs, provider coverage and whole-period consumer denominator; no fuel-per-lift or capacity/time defaults are specified. Independently establish every actual identity, state, real provider/receiver and exactly one exchange property/unit before constructing its flow card. Each actual exchange requires its own recorded quantity and applicable method, uncertainty and custody/fate coverage. Auxiliary CP units do not authorize extra exchange views. Actual occurrence unknown is not zero; never invent a material/species/provider list or split a parent total. Quantitative screening evidence must fit each actual exchange; a former family interval cannot be copied or divided into child ranges. Further actual identities not fully specified by the conditional children require mandatory refinement and prevent dataset completion; this requirement is not itself a flow exchange. Actual separate rigging provision/functions and different native references require concrete unit/scope; a complete crane service including rigging/hoisting is one provider boundary, not duplicate internal activities. Mobilization, capital/maintenance, operation and demobilization ownership all retained. | `cp_services`; actual independent records and identity/unit evidence |
| `refine_direct_fuel` | actual independently refined exchanges | Preserve this actual collection and closure scope as a mandatory dataset-production requirement: Conditional umbrella for actual combustion fuel identities crossing the site boundary. Use this card only for operation not already included in crane/access/logistics services; keep fuel types and supply forms separate. Range evidence need: Obtain actual equipment, fuel specification, consumed quantities and provider exclusions; fuel identity, density and consumption cannot be inferred from lifting requirements. Independently establish every actual identity, state, real provider/receiver and exactly one exchange property/unit before constructing its flow card. Each actual exchange requires its own recorded quantity and applicable method, uncertainty and custody/fate coverage. Auxiliary CP units do not authorize extra exchange views. Actual occurrence unknown is not zero; never invent a material/species/provider list or split a parent total. Quantitative screening evidence must fit each actual exchange; a former family interval cannot be copied or divided into child ranges. Further actual identities not fully specified by the conditional children require mandatory refinement and prevent dataset completion; this requirement is not itself a flow exchange. Each actual carrier/grade/native unit and equipment/event outside provider-inclusive crane/access/freight coverage; upstream nonreturned unburned loss remains supplied fuel burden, combustion activity independent. | `cp_resources`; actual independent records and identity/unit evidence |
| `refine_ancillary_materials` | `ancillary_materials_lubricant` | Preserve this actual collection and closure scope as a mandatory dataset-production requirement: Conditional umbrella for genuinely consumed supplementary materials such as equipment lubricants when attributable and absent from provider inputs. No coating, adhesive, truss repair chemical or water-consuming route is presumed. Range evidence need: Actual purchase/use/stock records and material identity are needed; a zero, one or multiple exchange outcome depends on the job and cannot use a generic chemical factor. Independently establish every actual identity, state, real provider/receiver and exactly one exchange property/unit before constructing its flow card. Each actual exchange requires its own recorded quantity and applicable method, uncertainty and custody/fate coverage. Auxiliary CP units do not authorize extra exchange views. Actual occurrence unknown is not zero; never invent a material/species/provider list or split a parent total. Quantitative screening evidence must fit each actual exchange; a former family interval cannot be copied or divided into child ranges. Further actual identities not fully specified by the conditional children require mandatory refinement and prevent dataset completion; this requirement is not itself a flow exchange. Other actual supplementary consumable functions/SKUs require actual identity/quantity; no presumed coating/adhesive/truss-repair chemical/water-consuming route, no provider duplicate. | `cp_components`; actual independent records and identity/unit evidence |
| `refine_transport_packaging` | `transport_packaging_wrapping`; `transport_packaging_strap`; `transport_packaging_dunnage` | Preserve this actual collection and closure scope as a mandatory dataset-production requirement: Identify actual wrapping, straps, dunnage and reusable packaging at the declared supply gate. Activate a separate burden-bearing input only for separately supplied packaging or the portion not covered by the upstream product dataset. Supplier-included packaging still requires physical custody/exit records, without a second upstream material-production burden. Reusable temporary-bracing assets remain in their service. Range evidence need: Obtain supplier packaging declarations and site counts/weighing with actual custody; no universal packaging intensity or return rate is established. Independently establish every actual identity, state, real provider/receiver and exactly one exchange property/unit before constructing its flow card. Each actual exchange requires its own recorded quantity and applicable method, uncertainty and custody/fate coverage. Auxiliary CP units do not authorize extra exchange views. Actual occurrence unknown is not zero; never invent a material/species/provider list or split a parent total. Quantitative screening evidence must fit each actual exchange; a former family interval cannot be copied or divided into child ranges. Further actual identities not fully specified by the conditional children require mandatory refinement and prevent dataset completion; this requirement is not itself a flow exchange. Actual reusable containers/other packaging and different material/ownership references require exact custody/life records; upstream-embedded manufacture physical ledger only, reusable temporary-bracing assets stay service. | `cp_residuals`; actual independent records and identity/unit evidence |
| `refine_reusable_returns` | `reusable_returns_timber_bracing`; `reusable_returns_hanger` | Preserve this actual collection and closure scope as a mandatory dataset-production requirement: Conditional product-output umbrella for genuine unused connectors/braces and reusable packaging leaving to a named supplier or store. Record separate materials and destinations; retained site stock is a ledger state rather than an invented exit. Do not place rejected trusses here. Range evidence need: Obtain actual return acceptance, custody and mass records; no default reusable fraction or avoided-production credit is assumed. Independently establish every actual identity, state, real provider/receiver and exactly one exchange property/unit before constructing its flow card. Each actual exchange requires its own recorded quantity and applicable method, uncertainty and custody/fate coverage. Auxiliary CP units do not authorize extra exchange views. Actual occurrence unknown is not zero; never invent a material/species/provider list or split a parent total. Quantitative screening evidence must fit each actual exchange; a former family interval cannot be copied or divided into child ranges. Further actual identities not fully specified by the conditional children require mandatory refinement and prevent dataset completion; this requirement is not itself a flow exchange. Actual other connectors/restraints/reinforcements/packaging require original SKU/state/native unit/recipient, stock not outward and rejected truss separate Count product/waste state. | `cp_residuals`; actual independent records and identity/unit evidence |
| `refine_erection_waste` | `erection_waste_truss`; `erection_waste_timber_bracing` | Preserve this actual collection and closure scope as a mandatory dataset-production requirement: Conditional waste-output umbrella for actual discarded connectors, braces, damaged trusses and packaging; segregate by material, hazardous status and receiving treatment. Retain failed-attempt and correction burdens. This route does not assume truss-cutting sawdust. Range evidence need: Obtain actual waste tickets, segregation and treatment evidence; no generic installation loss or recycling yield is imposed. Independently establish every actual identity, state, real provider/receiver and exactly one exchange property/unit before constructing its flow card. Each actual exchange requires its own recorded quantity and applicable method, uncertainty and custody/fate coverage. Auxiliary CP units do not authorize extra exchange views. Actual occurrence unknown is not zero; never invent a material/species/provider list or split a parent total. Quantitative screening evidence must fit each actual exchange; a former family interval cannot be copied or divided into child ranges. Further actual identities not fully specified by the conditional children require mandatory refinement and prevent dataset completion; this requirement is not itself a flow exchange. Actual discarded connectors, other members/packaging and material/hazard/receiver distinctions need independent identities; no presumed truss-cutting sawdust, failed/corrective work burdens retained. | `cp_residuals`; actual independent records and identity/unit evidence |
| `refine_direct_releases` | actual independently refined exchanges | Preserve this actual collection and closure scope as a mandatory dataset-production requirement: Conditional elementary-output umbrella for actual directly operated equipment combustion species and measured installation particles or other releases. Establish substance, receiving medium and particle class/basis before selecting each concrete flow; provider-included releases are not repeated. Range evidence need: Obtain actual equipment/fuel/emission-factor or sampling evidence and receiving medium; no generic VOC, particulate or exhaust quantity is fabricated. Independently establish every actual identity, state, real provider/receiver and exactly one exchange property/unit before constructing its flow card. Each actual exchange requires its own recorded quantity and applicable method, uncertainty and custody/fate coverage. Auxiliary CP units do not authorize extra exchange views. Actual occurrence unknown is not zero; never invent a material/species/provider list or split a parent total. Quantitative screening evidence must fit each actual exchange; a former family interval cannot be copied or divided into child ranges. Further actual identities not fully specified by the conditional children require mandatory refinement and prevent dataset completion; this requirement is not itself a flow exchange. Actual substance, disjoint particle-size fraction and air/water/soil receiving compartment; matched measurement or species/activity factor, whole-fluid composition/fate audit, capture and uncertainty; unknown is not zero. | `cp_releases`; actual independent records and identity/unit evidence |
| `atomic_exchange_identity_unit` | all inventory rows | Each concrete flow card identifies exactly one actual independently supplied product/SKU/formulation, complete assembly, complete single-function or genuine complete bounded provider service, actual waste composite/state/receiver, or substance/size/receiving medium, with exactly one property and unit. Different actual identities require independent quantities and records, not a summed family exchange. A complete product/carrier includes its contents once. Same unchanged SKU/state usable supply/return pairs and matched physical internal send/receive pairs use the same selected property/unit; kg and count or MJ and kWh auxiliaries are nonadditive measurements, never duplicate exchanges. Missing identity/occurrence/quantity/native reference is a gap, not zero. Any pooled denominator retains original configuration strata, accepted state/gate and actual causal attribution; no unlike jobs/branches/routes treated as equivalent. | actual identity, unit, custody and independent quantity evidence |
| `asset_final_normalization_once` | all inventory rows | An asset-equivalent formula already ending in division by N, D or A is the final quantity per reference flow. Its complete-life fraction and accepted-output normalization constitute the same normalization operation as the general normalization rule; never divide it by that denominator again. Apply the complete-life upstream burden exactly once. Actual complete provider event counts remain event quantities, not owned-asset fractions. | actual identity, unit, custody and independent quantity evidence |
