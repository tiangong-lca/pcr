# Mortared prefabricated firebrick firebox lining installation services

## 1. Scope and Applicability

This PCR covers the first mortared installation of a factory-made refractory firebrick lining set in an accepted compatible, unlined, single-opening ornamental masonry fireplace firebox. The service includes host-interface preparation, wetting, installation, supported cold cure, authorized temporary-holder removal, defect closure and signed lining-stage handover. It is a narrower category within CPC 3.0 54590; the classification does not define the PCR identity.

Exclude see-through fireplaces, optional arches/notching, combustion-air-hole drilling or air-kit installation, custom brick cutting, new shell/foundation/chimney construction, industrial furnace whole-lining services, first firing or operating commissioning, later relining and demolition. The accepted output carries no ready-to-fire, whole-fireplace, heating-efficiency or fire-rating claim. Use actual current compatible model, host and mortar instructions; the researched Mason-Lite document is printed REV 20090301a despite the URL filename2015 and upload path2022. It establishes an observed route, not universal current design applicability.

Actual initial lining cure/removal remains within this job cycle; later reusable-asset periods belong only to declared provision attribution, not fireplace operation. Unresolved replacement or terminal responsibility blocks a finalized data package. |  |

## 7. Allocation and Co-product Handling

| rule_id | Applies to | Rule | source_ids |
| --- | --- | --- | --- |
| single_service | install_lining | Assign all attributable receipts, preparation, installation, cure/support/removal and correction burdens to accepted complete lining service. Unresolved rejects are not accepted output; failed attempts are retained in actual job attribution. No useful co-product is presumed. |  |

Retained closing stock carries its disclosed upstream burden forward and is not an outward exchange. Never net a return in input then subtract/count it again. |  |
| rework_owner | install_lining | Link each off-spec panel/adhesion/seam/void failure to its corrective loop or actual product return/waste exit and producing-node event. Preserve replacement, cleanup, support extension and repeat logistics burdens; no automatic recovery or avoided-product credit. |  |
| shared_provision | `holders_tools_temporary_holder`; `holders_tools_trowel`; `holders_tools_reusable_sponge`; `holders_tools_mallet`; energy; logistics | For each reusable asset/provider, declare all job/period consumers and bounded provision service life, measured physical use driver and evidence. Allocate production/upkeep/removal/terminal provision once by target physical use over total compatible service capacity. State uncertainty and owner of future termination; supplier-included provision/energy/logistics must not be counted twice. |  |
| period_allocation | `holders_tools_temporary_holder`; `holders_tools_trowel`; `holders_tools_reusable_sponge`; `holders_tools_mallet`; logistics | Record period-specific provision shares and their physical-use/capacity evidence for production, service-use, upkeep/replacement and terminal events. Reconcile target-job and other-consumer shares to the complete bounded provision lifecycle; count each event once across periods. No universal asset lifetime or annualization is imposed, and no initial cure/removal duty is transferred out of the lining acceptance gate. |  |

### Calculation Rules

| rule_id | Applies to | Formula or rule | Inputs | Output | source_ids |
| --- | --- | --- | --- | --- | --- |
| job_attribution | all inventory rows | Collect the full declared initial job cycle, including correction and retained-support/removal burdens. Attribute each physical event once to its actual accepted complete lining output; retain rejected attempt burdens and report stock carry-forward separately. Express each resulting exchange per reference flow without assuming panel count or mass equivalence. | Actual node-specific protocols; acceptance ledger; event ownership | Exchange amounts per reference flow |  |

### Data Quality Requirements

| requirement_id | Applies to | Requirement | Evidence |
| --- | --- | --- | --- |
| current_compatibility | install_lining | Check actual host/lining/mortar instruction applicability; historical source revision alone is insufficient. Keep model strata and no universal cure/time/fire-rating conversion. | Manufacturer compatibility and project authorization; cp_acceptance |
| closure_quality | all inventory rows | Retain whole-cycle receipts/issues/returns/stock, defects, cure extension, holder removal and all receiver coverage. Missing quantity, Range evidence or actual identity remains an explicit data gap, never assumed zero. | Node-specific protocols and custody balances |
| support_quality | energy; logistics; `holders_tools_temporary_holder`; `holders_tools_trowel`; `holders_tools_reusable_sponge`; `holders_tools_mallet` | Confirm actual exchange property/unit and provider boundaries; Count support does not verify Energy, Duration or Transport. Retain uncertain provision life and shared-driver sensitivity. | Support rows, asset register, supplier coverage matrix and meter/trip records |
| `refine_panels` | `panels_complete_set`; `panels_hearth_replacement`; `panels_rear_replacement`; `panels_left_replacement`; `panels_right_replacement` | Preserve this actual collection and closure scope as a mandatory dataset-production requirement: Record the actual hearth, rear, left and right panel part identities, complete supplied set and any replacement panels. Count panel IDs for completeness but model their actual supplied mass; upstream panel production is included once. Range evidence need: Supplier model-specific part masses or calibrated receipts/issues, replacement count and uncertainty are required; the instruction provides no panel mass or universal material interval. Independently establish every actual identity, state, real provider/receiver and exactly one exchange property/unit before constructing its flow card. Each actual exchange requires its own recorded quantity and applicable method, uncertainty and custody/fate coverage. Auxiliary CP units do not authorize extra exchange views. Actual occurrence unknown is not zero; never invent a material/species/provider list or split a parent total. Quantitative screening evidence must fit each actual exchange; a former family interval cannot be copied or divided into child ranges. Further actual identities not fully specified by the conditional children require mandatory refinement and prevent dataset completion; this requirement is not itself a flow exchange. Any other actual supplied packet/part identities need complete SKU/state/native-unit records; count panel IDs for completeness but quantity remains independently established supplied kg. | `cp_materials`; actual independent records and identity/unit evidence |
| `refine_holders_tools` | `holders_tools_temporary_holder`; `holders_tools_trowel`; `holders_tools_reusable_sponge`; `holders_tools_mallet` | Preserve this actual collection and closure scope as a mandatory dataset-production requirement: Includes actual curing placeholders, trowels, sponges/mallets and access equipment as used. Identify owner, deployment, cure retention, authorized removal, reuse and terminal provision responsibility. Other jobs/periods share reusable assets only under a complete declared denominator. Range evidence need: Actual asset IDs, purchased/rented condition, lifespan/use-capacity evidence, use shares and replacement/removal records are needed; source shows support duty but supplies no item lifetime or allocation factor. Independently establish every actual identity, state, real provider/receiver and exactly one exchange property/unit before constructing its flow card. Each actual exchange requires its own recorded quantity and applicable method, uncertainty and custody/fate coverage. Auxiliary CP units do not authorize extra exchange views. Actual occurrence unknown is not zero; never invent a material/species/provider list or split a parent total. Quantitative screening evidence must fit each actual exchange; a former family interval cannot be copied or divided into child ranges. Further actual identities not fully specified by the conditional children require mandatory refinement and prevent dataset completion; this requirement is not itself a flow exchange. Actual access-equipment functions/other tools and different native references need exact identity/unit and complete bounded lifecycle, cure retention/authorized removal owner and terminal coverage. | `cp_assets`; actual independent records and identity/unit evidence |
| `refine_consumables` | `consumables_protective_sheet`; `consumables_wipe` | Preserve this actual collection and closure scope as a mandatory dataset-production requirement: Conditional umbrella for actual protective sheeting, wipes or cleaning materials. Supplied panel/mortar packaging is recorded physically with receipts and residuals, but its included upstream burden is not duplicated by creating a second purchase. Range evidence need: Actual material identities, invoices/issues, stock and cleanup records are required; no universal consumable or packaging mass interval is established. Independently establish every actual identity, state, real provider/receiver and exactly one exchange property/unit before constructing its flow card. Each actual exchange requires its own recorded quantity and applicable method, uncertainty and custody/fate coverage. Auxiliary CP units do not authorize extra exchange views. Actual occurrence unknown is not zero; never invent a material/species/provider list or split a parent total.

Further actual identities not fully specified by the conditional children require mandatory refinement and prevent dataset completion; this requirement is not itself a flow exchange. Actual other cleaning formulations/products require exact native identities/quantities; panel/mortar embedded packaging stays physical receipt/residual audit without a second purchase. | `cp_materials`; actual independent records and identity/unit evidence |
| `refine_material_returns` | `material_returns_complete_panel_set`; `material_returns_mortar` | Preserve this actual collection and closure scope as a mandatory dataset-production requirement: Only actual outward product custody movements qualify. Rejected components returned to supplier retain actual product/waste legal state and declared upstream burden treatment. Retained closing stock is an internal balance with carried-forward burden, never this exchange. Range evidence need: Actual return weigh tickets, part/state identity, destination, supplier acceptance and burden disposition are needed; no return fraction or universal reuse credit is supported. Independently establish every actual identity, state, real provider/receiver and exactly one exchange property/unit before constructing its flow card. Each actual exchange requires its own recorded quantity and applicable method, uncertainty and custody/fate coverage. Auxiliary CP units do not authorize extra exchange views. Actual occurrence unknown is not zero; never invent a material/species/provider list or split a parent total. Quantitative screening evidence must fit each actual exchange; a former family interval cannot be copied or divided into child ranges. Further actual identities not fully specified by the conditional children require mandatory refinement and prevent dataset completion; this requirement is not itself a flow exchange. Actual individually returned hearth/rear/side panels, consumables and changed/recovered product states need exact original component/state/native unit/receiver/burden bridge. Product/waste legal state documented, retained closing stock not output. | `cp_materials`; actual independent records and identity/unit evidence |
| `refine_solid_residuals` | `solid_residuals_panel`; `solid_residuals_hardened_mortar`; `solid_residuals_wet_mortar` | Preserve this actual collection and closure scope as a mandatory dataset-production requirement: Record damaged irrecoverable panels, cured/unused mortar discarded, packaging and contaminated consumables when actual. Corrections are linked to install_lining; internal rework is not an outward waste. No useful coproduct or avoided production is assumed. Range evidence need: Actual segregation/weighing, hazard classification, receiver and replacement records are needed; no default breakage, mortar loss or packaging interval is evidenced. Independently establish every actual identity, state, real provider/receiver and exactly one exchange property/unit before constructing its flow card. Each actual exchange requires its own recorded quantity and applicable method, uncertainty and custody/fate coverage. Auxiliary CP units do not authorize extra exchange views. Actual occurrence unknown is not zero; never invent a material/species/provider list or split a parent total. Quantitative screening evidence must fit each actual exchange; a former family interval cannot be copied or divided into child ranges. Further actual identities not fully specified by the conditional children require mandatory refinement and prevent dataset completion; this requirement is not itself a flow exchange. Actual packaging/contaminated supplies and actual composition/hazard/receiver splits need exact records; internal corrections not outward waste, no useful co-product or credit. | `cp_residuals`; actual independent records and identity/unit evidence |
| `refine_releases` | actual independently refined exchanges | Preserve this actual collection and closure scope as a mandatory dataset-production requirement: Conditional umbrella for demonstrated fugitive material or direct wastewater release; no drilling/cutting dust, combustion emission or generic VOC is presumed in this uncut cold route. Each actual elementary exchange needs verified substance identity and medium. Range evidence need: Actual material safety/composition, measured release characterization, species/size fraction, medium and uncertainty are required; no emission factor or generic dust amount is evidenced. Independently establish every actual identity, state, real provider/receiver and exactly one exchange property/unit before constructing its flow card. Each actual exchange requires its own recorded quantity and applicable method, uncertainty and custody/fate coverage. Auxiliary CP units do not authorize extra exchange views. Actual occurrence unknown is not zero; never invent a material/species/provider list or split a parent total. Quantitative screening evidence must fit each actual exchange; a former family interval cannot be copied or divided into child ranges. Further actual identities not fully specified by the conditional children require mandatory refinement and prevent dataset completion; this requirement is not itself a flow exchange. Actual substance, disjoint particle-size fraction and air/water/soil receiving compartment; matched measurement or species/activity factor, whole-fluid composition/fate audit, capture and uncertainty; unknown is not zero. | `cp_releases`; actual independent records and identity/unit evidence |
| `atomic_exchange_identity_unit` | all inventory rows | Each concrete flow card identifies exactly one actual independently supplied product/SKU/formulation, complete assembly, complete single-function or genuine complete bounded provider service, actual waste composite/state/receiver, or substance/size/receiving medium, with exactly one property and unit. Different actual identities require independent quantities and records, not a summed family exchange. A complete product/carrier includes its contents once. Same unchanged SKU/state usable supply/return pairs and matched physical internal send/receive pairs use the same selected property/unit; kg and count or MJ and kWh auxiliaries are nonadditive measurements, never duplicate exchanges. Missing identity/occurrence/quantity/native reference is a gap, not zero. Any pooled denominator retains original configuration strata, accepted state/gate and actual causal attribution; no unlike jobs/branches/routes treated as equivalent. | actual identity, unit, custody and independent quantity evidence |
| `asset_final_normalization_once` | all inventory rows | An asset-equivalent formula already ending in division by N, D or A is the final quantity per reference flow. Its complete-life fraction and accepted-output normalization constitute the same normalization operation as the general normalization rule; never divide it by that denominator again. Apply the complete-life upstream burden exactly once. Actual complete provider event counts remain event quantities, not owned-asset fractions. | actual identity, unit, custody and independent quantity evidence |

| `atomization_solid_residuals_complete` | `solid_residuals_panel`; `solid_residuals_hardened_mortar`; `solid_residuals_wet_mortar` | Require independent actual quantity, identity/state/gate and one property/unit for each applicable exchange in this scope; preserve full original protocol, normalization, stock, returns, waste/releases and shared-resource ownership. Reject completion on an unknown required child, unsupported native reference or missing quantity; evidenced nonoccurrence is separate from missing data. No family-total allocation, copied family Range or duplicate carrier/constituent/bundled-part exchange. Completion requires satisfying `refine_solid_residuals` with actual records; unresolved required expansion blocks the dataset. |  |
| `atomization_releases_complete` | actual independently refined exchanges | Require independent actual quantity, identity/state/gate and one property/unit for each applicable exchange in this scope; preserve full original protocol, normalization, stock, returns, waste/releases and shared-resource ownership. Reject completion on an unknown required child, unsupported native reference or missing quantity; evidenced nonoccurrence is separate from missing data. No family-total allocation, copied family Range or duplicate carrier/constituent/bundled-part exchange. Completion requires satisfying `refine_releases` with actual records; unresolved required expansion blocks the dataset. |  |
| `validate_atomic_exchange_unit_and_normalization` | all inventory rows | Each concrete flow card identifies exactly one actual independently supplied product/SKU/formulation, complete assembly, complete single-function or genuine complete bounded provider service, actual waste composite/state/receiver, or substance/size/receiving medium, with exactly one property and unit. Different actual identities require independent quantities and records, not a summed family exchange. A complete product/carrier includes its contents once. Same unchanged SKU/state usable supply/return pairs and matched physical internal send/receive pairs use the same selected property/unit; kg and count or MJ and kWh auxiliaries are nonadditive measurements, never duplicate exchanges. Missing identity/occurrence/quantity/native reference is a gap, not zero. An asset-equivalent formula already ending in division by N, D or A is the final quantity per reference flow. Its complete-life fraction and accepted-output normalization constitute the same normalization operation as the general normalization rule; never divide it by that denominator again. Apply the complete-life upstream burden exactly once. Actual complete provider event counts remain event quantities, not owned-asset fractions. |  |
