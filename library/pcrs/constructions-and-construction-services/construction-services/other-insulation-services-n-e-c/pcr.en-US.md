# Mechanically fixed plastic-pipe wall firestop collar installation services

## 1. Scope and Applicability

This PCR covers first mechanical installation of factory-made steel-housed intumescent collars around one existing plastic-pipe wall penetration. The wall, pipe and any required annular seal have already been installed and accepted; their documented compatibility with the chosen firestop system is an entry condition. The installer checks that interface, cleans the collar contact area, marks and drills fixing holes, closes and latches the collars, fits hooks and approved mechanical fixings, inspects, identifies and hands over the completed stage. The service includes every wall face required by the actual system.

Exclude construction of the wall, pipe or core opening; application or repair of annular sealant; floor penetrations; metal pipes; powder-actuated fastening; and later building use. A failed prior seal or incompatible configuration stops this route and requires a separately bounded corrective service. Hilti CP 643N is a route example, not an exclusive supplier prescription. W-L-2078 (drawing revision 17 April 2018) demonstrates a specific gypsum-wall/plastic-pipe system with seal and fastening conditions; it does not establish that all wall systems or preseals are interchangeable. Retain the actual matching approval and current instructions applicable to the supplied collar and fixings. Their latest applicability must be checked for each job; an accessible historical drawing is not proof of current project approval.

## 5. System Boundary

### Boundary Abstraction

| Field | Value |
| --- | --- |
| declared_starting_condition | Accepted existing wall and installed plastic pipe, with an already accepted annular seal where the selected system requires or permits the declared seal; available access and approved working conditions. Record actual configuration and seal custody. |
| starting_condition_role | Customer-owned building interface supplied for collar fitting, not a newly purchased wall/pipe/seal input. Its earlier construction burdens are outside this installation-stage dataset and must be added once by the wider model owner. |
| product_classification_scope | Narrow fireproofing installation service within CPC 3.0 54659; classification alone does not authorize any physical system. |
| recursive_input_rule | Do not use another complete collar-installation service as a recursive proxy for the present stage. A subcontracted operation must have an explicit nonoverlapping service boundary and ownership ledger. |
| upstream_dataset_requirement | Link actual collar package, separate fixings/consumables, electricity and bounded provider services to compatible upstream datasets; disclose packaging, hooks, transport and energy coverage and every unresolved identity. |
| disclosure | Declare installation-stage start/end, prior-interface acceptance evidence, actual approval/instruction versions, custody, included deliveries/returns/waste-service gates and supplier service coverage. |

Their latest applicability must be checked for each job; an accessible historical drawing is not proof of current project approval. |  |
| b_interface | collar_install | Before installation, match actual wall, pipe, annular geometry and preseal to the selected tested/approved system and current supplied instructions. Record the seal acceptance and inspect it for damage; absence of compatibility evidence blocks output. | hilti-wl2078-2018 |
| b_route | collar_install | Include cleaning, drilling and dust control, collar latching, hooks/fixings, identification, inspection, corrective mechanical refitting and cleanup through signed handover. Keep wet sealing and damaged-interface repair outside this stage and reopen only after separately documented acceptance. | hilti-firestop-guide-2016 |
| b_components | collar_install | The component roles are factory steel/intumescent collars, hooks and anchor/washer sets, plus identification material where used. Supply records identify kit coverage; record extra components only where not supplied in the kit. Never replace the collar with raw steel or raw intumescent compound. | hilti-wl2078-2018 |
| b_services | collar_install | Include actual energy, cleaning supplies and bounded supplier-owned drilling/extraction/access services. The same drill, extractor, charger and access service may serve collar_install across initial and corrective visits and other jobs; enumerate the service periods and all consumers in cp_resources. The provider owns equipment production/maintenance allocation within the documented service. Record separately purchased energy or delivery only outside that coverage. |  |
| b_exits | collar_install | Record each physical packaging, dust, damaged part and cleaning-residue exit at its actual receiving gate; document the owner of later transport/treatment. A material is a usable return only with confirmed reusable condition and recipient/stock custody, otherwise classify the actual waste route. |  |


## 6. Process Inventory Structure

### Process Map

| process_id | process_name | inclusion | inclusion_condition | role | quantitative_reference |
| --- | --- | --- | --- | --- | --- |
| collar_install | Mechanical collar fitting, inspection and handover | required | Compatible accepted preseal and actual matching wall/pipe/collar/fixing system established | assembly integration of factory collar components with existing customer wall interface; rework/reject and shared infrastructure responsibilities | 1 Item(s) accepted complete penetration stage |

One bounded node owns all mechanical fitting and inspection. A loose latch, wrong hook/anchor arrangement or failed visual inspection returns to collar_install for correction and reinspection with all resource burdens retained. Damaged components leave by the actual return or waste card; incompatible or damaged prior seals block this route and leave for separate interface correction. No failed stage is an additional accepted item. Conditional cards apply only to recorded actual resources/exits; their absence requires documented non-use, not assumed zero quantities.

### Process: Mechanical collar fitting, inspection and handover (`collar_install`)

#### Inputs

##### Product flows

###### Factory steel-housed intumescent plastic-pipe firestop collars (`collars`)

Receive the actual finished collar model/size for every required wall face, including issue for failed attempts. Identify supplied hook/packaging coverage explicitly; steel and intumescent material are constituents, not alternative finished-collar identities.

- Selected flow: Factory steel-housed intumescent plastic-pipe firestop collars
- Flow property / unit: Number of items `01846770-4cfe-4a25-8ad9-919d8d378345` / Item(s)
- Amount rule: Gross issued collar count by exact model for the declared work-order lot, attributed to accepted complete stages; keep unused return and stock change separate.

##### Elementary flows

## 7. Allocation and Co-product Handling

| rule_id | Applies to | Rule | source_ids |
| --- | --- | --- | --- |
| a_rework | collar_install | Retain failed attempts, extra visits, replacement parts and cleanup in the responsible work-order burden. Only accepted complete stages form the denominator; unresolved rejects remain pending, with their incurred resources reported and not hidden by an inflated output count. |  |
| a_shared | `tool_access_service_drill`; `tool_access_service_extractor`; `tool_access_service_charger`; installation_electricity; logistics_service | Index shared drill/extractor/charger/access and transport services by provider, service period and every consuming job/visit, including collar_install initial and corrective visits. Attribute measured use directly where possible; otherwise use documented task time within that same complete service period. Reconcile shares to the full billed/metered resource and disclose other jobs. Count each service or energy component once. |  |
| a_returns | `usable_returns_collar`; `usable_returns_hook`; `usable_returns_anchor`; `usable_returns_screw`; `usable_returns_washer`; `packaging_waste_carton`; `packaging_waste_plastic_bag`; `packaging_waste_insert`; `component_waste_collar` | Use a gross issue and separate exit ledger: issued components/packaging = installed or consumed + usable returns + waste + stock change. Record actual returned product identity and destination separately; never both subtract it from gross inputs and give an avoided-production credit. Recovery or recycling credit requires a separately declared study method and receiving route, not a material label. |  |
| a_products | accepted_collar_installation | The accepted installation is the sole intended product. Usable surplus/packaging returns are custody transfers, not a second installation output; no automatic co-product split or future fire-performance credit is assigned. |  |


## 8. Foreground Data Collection, Calculation, and Quality Rules

### Data Collection Protocols

| protocol_id | process_id | flow_role | record_type | raw_fields | collection_method | unit | frequency | temporal_coverage | site_scope | aggregation_rule | quality_evidence |

Retain kit contents and split cleaning/label inputs by actual identity. Keep gross issue separate from returns and stock change. Divide attributable lot quantities by accepted same-configuration stages after reconciliation. Record each actual child/refined exchange independently by identity, physical event, state, gate and period. Retain all original obligations even where a corresponding exchange identity is not yet known. Do not allocate a family total or copy its numerical Range to children, count a carrier and its contained material twice, or turn missing occurrence/quantity/native reference into zero. Each concrete exchange has one property and one unit; other CP readings are auxiliary and require evidenced conversion. Missing required refinement blocks dataset completion. | Item(s); kg | each issue/return and work-order close | all installation and correction visits | work-order store and point of use | per reference flow | Invoices, batch/model labels, calibrated scale or traceable net mass, physical count and custody reconciliation |
| cp_resources | collar_install | electricity, shared tool/access and logistics services | meter and provider service ledger | resource_id; provider; service_start; service_end; consumer_job_ids; visit_ids; billed_hours; task_hours; meter_kWh; charge_sessions; included_energy; included_transport; route; load; distance; receiving_gate; concrete_exchange_id; physical_event_id; actual_identity_id; actual_state; receiver_or_provider_gate; native_quantity; native_unit; unique_property; measurement_method_id; uncertainty | Read actual metered drilling/extraction/charging use and bounded supplier service hours. Identify all consumers and periods, allocate shared amounts using measured consumption or documented task-time shares and reconcile to total. Record actual delivery/return movements and provider coverage. Retain actual transport load/distance metadata for later service matching, without a generic trip factor. Record each actual child/refined exchange independently by identity, physical event, state, gate and period. Retain all original obligations even where a corresponding exchange identity is not yet known. Do not allocate a family total or copy its numerical Range to children, count a carrier and its contained material twice, or turn missing occurrence/quantity/native reference into zero. Each concrete exchange has one property and one unit; other CP readings are auxiliary and require evidenced conversion. Missing required refinement blocks dataset completion. | kWh; h | each meter/service period and visit | supply to final correction and cleanup | all consumers of each declared service period | per reference flow | Meter calibration/readings, provider scope, time sheets, full denominator, shares sum to one and no duplicate included energy/transport |

Reconcile issued stock, installed materials and exits; verify usable returns with receiving custody. Allocate only the declared work-order share to accepted stages; retain pending/reject burdens. Record each actual child/refined exchange independently by identity, physical event, state, gate and period. Retain all original obligations even where a corresponding exchange identity is not yet known. Do not allocate a family total or copy its numerical Range to children, count a carrier and its contained material twice, or turn missing occurrence/quantity/native reference into zero. Each concrete exchange has one property and one unit; other CP readings are auxiliary and require evidenced conversion. Missing required refinement blocks dataset completion. | kg; Item(s) | each exit and work-order close | all installation/correction/cleanup visits | declared installation and receiving gates | per reference flow | Calibrated weights, transfer notes, recipient acceptance, material/waste classification and mass reconciliation |
| cp_releases | collar_install | actual elementary air or other environmental release | measurement or reviewed emission calculation | substance_or_particle; composition; size_fraction; compartment; measured_mass; sampling_period; activity_record; factor_reference; capture_efficiency; uncertainty; controls; concrete_exchange_id; physical_event_id; actual_identity_id; actual_state; receiver_or_provider_gate; native_quantity; native_unit; unique_property; measurement_method_id | Characterize actual uncollected drilling particles and any cleaning-related release separately by substance/particle identity and receiving compartment, with measured mass or a reviewed task-specific emission calculation. Retain control and capture evidence. Captured debris is waste, not emitted mass; VOC content is not an emission factor. Absence of measurement/factor is a data gap, not zero. Record each actual child/refined exchange independently by identity, physical event, state, gate and period. Retain all original obligations even where a corresponding exchange identity is not yet known. Do not allocate a family total or copy its numerical Range to children, count a carrier and its contained material twice, or turn missing occurrence/quantity/native reference into zero. Each concrete exchange has one property and one unit; other CP readings are auxiliary and require evidenced conversion. Missing required refinement blocks dataset completion. | kg | each relevant operation or representative measured period | all drilling, cleaning and corrections | actual foreground operation and environment boundary | per reference flow | Sampling/analysis, reviewed factor applicability, particle/chemical identity, measured activity, uncertainty and non-duplication with captured waste |

### Calculation Rules

| rule_id | Applies to | Formula or rule | Inputs | Output | source_ids |
| --- | --- | --- | --- | --- | --- |
| lot_attribution | all inventory rows | For each homogeneous accepted-stage lot, reconcile the attributable gross resource or exit amount including corrective work, then divide by its accepted complete-stage count. Report unresolved jobs and associated burdens separately; do not mix configurations without declared equivalence. | cp_acceptance; cp_materials; cp_resources; cp_exits; cp_releases | inventory per reference flow |  |
| stock_balance | collars; `additional_fixings_hook`; `additional_fixings_anchor`; `additional_fixings_screw`; `additional_fixings_washer`; `usable_returns_collar`; `usable_returns_hook`; `usable_returns_anchor`; `usable_returns_screw`; `usable_returns_washer`; `component_waste_collar`; `packaging_waste_carton`; `packaging_waste_plastic_bag`; `packaging_waste_insert` | Reconcile gross issues with installed/consumed quantity, usable returns, waste and stock change for each material and compatible unit. Use measured net unit mass when reconciling count and kg; packaging is separate from component net mass. | cp_materials; cp_exits | material-specific reconciliation |  |
| shared_share | `tool_access_service_drill`; `tool_access_service_extractor`; `tool_access_service_charger`; installation_electricity; logistics_service | Use measured task resource where available; otherwise allocate the bounded shared service by documented task time divided by total consumer task time within that service period. Reconcile every share to the actual billed/metered amount and provider coverage. | cp_resources | attributable service/resource amount |  |

### Data Quality Requirements

| requirement_id | Applies to | Requirement | Evidence |
| --- | --- | --- | --- |
| q_configuration | reference product | Keep actual approvals and current chosen instructions, material configurations and installed faces traceable. Product family marketing and historic rating maxima are insufficient for job acceptance. | cp_acceptance and source applicability review |
| q_completeness | all inventory rows | Record drilling, extraction/charging, cleaning, shared access, logistics, packaging and corrective work; distinguish documented non-use, provider-included coverage and missing data. | cp_materials; cp_resources; cp_exits |
| q_ranges | all inventory rows | Collect observed variability and uncertainty for the actual configuration. No manufacturer expansion ratio, thermal limit, rating duration or VOC content supplies an installation inventory Range. | Per-card Range evidence needs and actual lot records |
| q_identities | all inventory rows | Resolve every actual product/waste/elementary exchange and its support property/unit chain before final TIDAS dataset emission; split conditional aggregate roles into concrete identities. | Verified detail and support evidence; explicit unresolved manifest entries |
| q_releases | actual exchanges required by `refine_air_releases` | Distinguish released particles/substances from captured dust and disposed wipes; never claim generic zero emissions from absence of wet sealing. | cp_releases and cp_exits |
| `refine_additional_fixings` | `additional_fixings_hook`; `additional_fixings_anchor`; `additional_fixings_screw`; `additional_fixings_washer` | Preserve this actual collection and closure scope as a mandatory dataset-production requirement: Record only hooks, approved mechanical anchors/screws and washers not already supplied within the collar kit, plus actual replacements. Split each actual component identity and net mass when required; the selected system governs its suitability. Range evidence need: Obtain actual package bill of materials, required hook/fixing arrangement and extra/replacement issue records. Different pipe sizes and substrates require different compatible quantities; the W-L-2078 example cannot supply a generic quantity or loss Range. Independently establish every actual identity, state, real provider/receiver and exactly one exchange property/unit before constructing its flow card. Each actual exchange requires its own recorded quantity and applicable method, uncertainty and custody/fate coverage. Auxiliary CP units do not authorize extra exchange views. Actual occurrence unknown is not zero; never invent a material/species/provider list or split a parent total. Quantitative screening evidence must fit each actual exchange; a former family interval cannot be copied or divided into child ranges. Further actual identities not fully specified by the conditional children require mandatory refinement and prevent dataset completion; this requirement is not itself a flow exchange. Other actual component/SKU and assembly-specific suitability need exact records; actual kit-included parts not new purchase, measured mass is nonadditive auxiliary. | `cp_materials`; actual independent records and identity/unit evidence |
| `refine_cleaning_supplies` | `cleaning_supplies_cleaner`; `cleaning_supplies_cloth`; `cleaning_supplies_water` | Preserve this actual collection and closure scope as a mandatory dataset-production requirement: Conditional on actual use: record each cleaning product, cloth or water supply and identification material separately by exact product and mass. Cleaning the pipe contact zone and identifying the stage do not authorize new wet annular sealing. Range evidence need: Collect actual cleaning method, supply identity, mass and variability from job records; no generic solvent, water or label consumption is prescribed. If the existing interface needs sealant repair, leave this route for separate corrective work. Independently establish every actual identity, state, real provider/receiver and exactly one exchange property/unit before constructing its flow card. Each actual exchange requires its own recorded quantity and applicable method, uncertainty and custody/fate coverage. Auxiliary CP units do not authorize extra exchange views. Actual occurrence unknown is not zero; never invent a material/species/provider list or split a parent total. Quantitative screening evidence must fit each actual exchange; a former family interval cannot be copied or divided into child ranges. Further actual identities not fully specified by the conditional children require mandatory refinement and prevent dataset completion; this requirement is not itself a flow exchange. Other actual identification forms/cleaning products need exact product identity and independent quantity; no new wet annular sealing or whole prewetted carrier constituent duplicate. | `cp_materials`; actual independent records and identity/unit evidence |
| `refine_tool_access_service` | `tool_access_service_drill`; `tool_access_service_extractor`; `tool_access_service_charger` | Preserve this actual collection and closure scope as a mandatory dataset-production requirement: Record actual supplier-owned drill, extractor, charger and access equipment services by provider and bounded hire/service period. They may serve this node across initial and corrective visits and other work orders; provider production/maintenance burdens remain within the disclosed service scope. Range evidence need: Obtain billed scope, actual service hours, consumer job/visit ledger and observed variability. No tool lifetime, replacement frequency or standalone Duration support identity is inferred; a different own-capital route requires additional multi-period review. Independently establish every actual identity, state, real provider/receiver and exactly one exchange property/unit before constructing its flow card. Each actual exchange requires its own recorded quantity and applicable method, uncertainty and custody/fate coverage. Auxiliary CP units do not authorize extra exchange views. Actual occurrence unknown is not zero; never invent a material/species/provider list or split a parent total. Quantitative screening evidence must fit each actual exchange; a former family interval cannot be copied or divided into child ranges. Further actual identities not fully specified by the conditional children require mandatory refinement and prevent dataset completion; this requirement is not itself a flow exchange. Actual access-equipment functions/other models and different native service references require precise complete service/property/unit, all consuming work orders/visits and bounded provider production/maintenance coverage. | `cp_resources`; actual independent records and identity/unit evidence |
| `refine_usable_returns` | `usable_returns_collar`; `usable_returns_hook`; `usable_returns_anchor`; `usable_returns_screw`; `usable_returns_washer` | Preserve this actual collection and closure scope as a mandatory dataset-production requirement: Conditional: each unused collar/fixing or reusable packaging item is a separate product identity only when usable condition and receiving supplier/store custody are documented. This card describes exit roles, not a generic mixed-material product. Provider-owned tools return within their service contract and are not material coproducts here. Range evidence need: Obtain physical condition, actual component/packaging identity, receiving acceptance, mass and variability. Do not assume all packaging is reusable or give an avoided-production credit merely because it leaves the site. Independently establish every actual identity, state, real provider/receiver and exactly one exchange property/unit before constructing its flow card. Each actual exchange requires its own recorded quantity and applicable method, uncertainty and custody/fate coverage. Auxiliary CP units do not authorize extra exchange views. Actual occurrence unknown is not zero; never invent a material/species/provider list or split a parent total. Quantitative screening evidence must fit each actual exchange; a former family interval cannot be copied or divided into child ranges. Further actual identities not fully specified by the conditional children require mandatory refinement and prevent dataset completion; this requirement is not itself a flow exchange. Actual reusable packaging and other returned products require exact state/recipient and inbound matching native unit; provider tools return within service, not material co-products. | `cp_exits`; actual independent records and identity/unit evidence |
| `refine_component_waste` | `component_waste_collar` | Preserve this actual collection and closure scope as a mandatory dataset-production requirement: Conditional: components damaged or rejected during fitting leave collar_install for the documented receiving waste route when not accepted as a usable return. Keep steel housing/intumescent composite and other materials separate where classification or destination differs; do not relabel a rejected whole installation as an accepted service. Range evidence need: Obtain rejected-part records, material classification, actual receiver and measured variability. No standard scrap rate, automatic recycled-metal identity or recovery percentage is prescribed. Independently establish every actual identity, state, real provider/receiver and exactly one exchange property/unit before constructing its flow card. Each actual exchange requires its own recorded quantity and applicable method, uncertainty and custody/fate coverage. Auxiliary CP units do not authorize extra exchange views. Actual occurrence unknown is not zero; never invent a material/species/provider list or split a parent total. Quantitative screening evidence must fit each actual exchange; a former family interval cannot be copied or divided into child ranges. Further actual identities not fully specified by the conditional children require mandatory refinement and prevent dataset completion; this requirement is not itself a flow exchange. Actual separate discarded fixing components and different hazard/receiver states need separate exact identity/quantity; do not disaggregate contained collar material without a real separately dispatched stream. | `cp_exits`; actual independent records and identity/unit evidence |
| `refine_packaging_waste` | `packaging_waste_carton`; `packaging_waste_plastic_bag`; `packaging_waste_insert` | Preserve this actual collection and closure scope as a mandatory dataset-production requirement: Conditional: record actual cartons, plastic bags, inserts or other discarded packaging by material and destination. Incoming collar package coverage includes packaging supply burdens where declared; output mass does not create a second packaging input. Confirmed reusable packaging belongs to the independent packaging-return requirement in refine_usable_returns. Establish its own actual packaging identity, usable state, recipient and same inbound native property/unit with an independently measured outward quantity before dataset completion. Never record packaging on collar, hook, anchor, screw or washer return cards, and never subtract returned packaging as returned installed components. Range evidence need: Obtain packaging composition, mass, recovery eligibility and actual receiving records. No default packaging ratio or recycling credit is supported by the collar product specification. Independently establish every actual identity, state, real provider/receiver and exactly one exchange property/unit before constructing its flow card. Each actual exchange requires its own recorded quantity and applicable method, uncertainty and custody/fate coverage. Auxiliary CP units do not authorize extra exchange views. Actual occurrence unknown is not zero; never invent a material/species/provider list or split a parent total. Quantitative screening evidence must fit each actual exchange; a former family interval cannot be copied or divided into child ranges. Further actual identities not fully specified by the conditional children require mandatory refinement and prevent dataset completion; this requirement is not itself a flow exchange. Other actual materials/composites/receiver splits need real roster; kit-included packaging manufacture already owned upstream and output does not create second input; reusable product returns excluded. | `cp_exits`; actual independent records and identity/unit evidence |
| `refine_cleaning_waste` | `cleaning_waste_cloth`; `cleaning_waste_loose_residue`; `cleaning_waste_wastewater` | Preserve this actual collection and closure scope as a mandatory dataset-production requirement: Conditional: used cloths, cleaning residues or collected wastewater leave to their actual receiving waste/treatment gate. Separate solid and liquid identities, including contamination; no wastewater is assumed for a dry-cleaning task. Range evidence need: Collect cleaning method, actual residue composition, contaminated-material classification, mass and receiver. No generic water use, wastewater volume or hazardous status is inferred. Independently establish every actual identity, state, real provider/receiver and exactly one exchange property/unit before constructing its flow card. Each actual exchange requires its own recorded quantity and applicable method, uncertainty and custody/fate coverage. Auxiliary CP units do not authorize extra exchange views. Actual occurrence unknown is not zero; never invent a material/species/provider list or split a parent total. Quantitative screening evidence must fit each actual exchange; a former family interval cannot be copied or divided into child ranges. Further actual identities not fully specified by the conditional children require mandatory refinement and prevent dataset completion; this requirement is not itself a flow exchange. Actual different formulations/states/hazard/receivers or other spent supplies need precise records; solid/liquid and captured/direct-release fates exclusive. | `cp_exits`; actual independent records and identity/unit evidence |
| `refine_air_releases` | actual independently refined exchanges | Preserve this actual collection and closure scope as a mandatory dataset-production requirement: Conditional on actual release: instantiate each uncollected drilling-particle fraction or cleaning-related substance with its exact composition, particle fraction and compartment. If other environmental releases occur, identify their actual receiving compartment separately. Captured dust and waste are excluded from emitted mass. Range evidence need: Obtain actual particle/substance identification, measured release or applicable emission factor, control/capture evidence and uncertainty. Product VOC content, low-emitting marketing, or absence of wet sealant cannot be converted into installation emitted mass. Independently establish every actual identity, state, real provider/receiver and exactly one exchange property/unit before constructing its flow card. Each actual exchange requires its own recorded quantity and applicable method, uncertainty and custody/fate coverage. Auxiliary CP units do not authorize extra exchange views. Actual occurrence unknown is not zero; never invent a material/species/provider list or split a parent total. Quantitative screening evidence must fit each actual exchange; a former family interval cannot be copied or divided into child ranges. Further actual identities not fully specified by the conditional children require mandatory refinement and prevent dataset completion; this requirement is not itself a flow exchange. Actual substance, disjoint particle-size fraction and air/water/soil receiving compartment; matched measurement or species/activity factor, whole-fluid composition/fate audit, capture and uncertainty; unknown is not zero. | `cp_releases`; actual independent records and identity/unit evidence |
| `atomic_exchange_identity_unit` | all inventory rows | Each concrete flow card identifies exactly one actual independently supplied product/SKU/formulation, complete assembly, complete single-function or genuine complete bounded provider service, actual waste composite/state/receiver, or substance/size/receiving medium, with exactly one property and unit. Different actual identities require independent quantities and records, not a summed family exchange. A complete product/carrier includes its contents once. Same unchanged SKU/state usable supply/return pairs and matched physical internal send/receive pairs use the same selected property/unit; kg and count or MJ and kWh auxiliaries are nonadditive measurements, never duplicate exchanges. Missing identity/occurrence/quantity/native reference is a gap, not zero. Any pooled denominator must retain the original accepted configuration strata, state/gate and causal attribution; do not divide unlike circuits, routes, products or jobs as if they were equivalent. | actual identity, unit, custody and independent quantity evidence |
| `asset_final_normalization_once` | all inventory rows | An asset-equivalent formula already ending in division by N, D or A is the final quantity per reference flow. Its complete-life fraction and accepted-output normalization constitute the same normalization operation as the general normalization rule; never divide it by that denominator again. Apply the complete-life upstream burden exactly once. Actual complete provider event counts remain event quantities, not owned-asset fractions. | actual identity, unit, custody and independent quantity evidence |


## 9. Validation Rules

| rule_id | Applies to | Rule | source_ids |
| --- | --- | --- | --- |
| v_entry | collar_install | Reject reference completion when actual wall/pipe/seal/collar/fixing configuration lacks a matching approval and current applicable instructions, or prior seal compatibility/condition is unconfirmed. | hilti-wl2078-2018 |
| v_handover | accepted_collar_installation | Verify required faces, latched collars, hook/fastener arrangement, undamaged prior seal, identification and signed inspection. Count one whole penetration stage once; a generic fire-hour promise is not an acceptance test. | hilti-firestop-guide-2016 |
| v_rework | collar_install | Trace each failure to mechanical correction and reinspection, confirmed product return, classified waste exit or separately bounded interface repair; never count unresolved failures as accepted output. |  |
| v_shared | `tool_access_service_drill`; `tool_access_service_extractor`; `tool_access_service_charger`; installation_electricity; logistics_service | Check all consuming jobs/periods and resource-share totals; reject duplicate equipment/energy/transport burdens already included in the supplier service. No inferred equipment lifetime is permitted. |  |
