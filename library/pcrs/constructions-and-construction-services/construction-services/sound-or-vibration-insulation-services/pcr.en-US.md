# Dry-laid neoprene equipment isolation pad installation services

## 1. Scope and Applicability

This PCR covers a separately contracted first installation of single-layer, unbonded, modular neoprene vibration-isolation pads beneath one indoor machine on an existing accepted support surface. The actual equipment and pad supplier must permit an unanchored dry-laid arrangement at the declared location. Equipment arrives at the installation position, stopped and isolated, with lifting points and loading information available. The installer surveys supports, confirms the approved pad schedule, hand-cuts complete modules where needed, lifts locally, places pads, lowers the equipment, inspects the loaded arrangement, corrects defects and hands over the accepted isolation installation.

Exclude equipment manufacture or general equipment installation, long-distance positioning, floor or foundation construction, anchoring and seismic restraint, adhesives or grout, stacked pads or added shims, spring mounts, wall/ceiling acoustic finishes, old-pad removal, powered cutting, chemical cleaning, operating-performance tests and subsequent operation. If any excluded activity is necessary, this category alone is insufficient; do not omit it from a larger system. This gate establishes installation conformity, not a numerical vibration reduction or an operating-machine commissioning result. Mason SW illustrates modular neoprene supply and some unbolted applications, not a universal no-anchor design (`mason-super-w-2014`).

## 4. Measurement and Unit Rules

| rule_id | Applies to | Required property | Required unit | Rule |
| --- | --- | --- | --- | --- |
| accepted_count | accepted_isolation | Number of items `01846770-4cfe-4a25-8ad9-919d8d378345` | Item(s) | D is the independently recorded count of completed accepted same-configuration installations in cp_gate. Count one entire installation, not individual pads or supports. |
| mass_records | neoprene_pads; actual exchanges required by `refine_packaging`; `usable_returns_pad_module`; `usable_returns_usable_offcut`; `installation_waste_neoprene` | Mass `93a60a56-a3c8-11da-a746-0800200b9a66` | kg | Weigh actual material by grade and custody state. Piece-to-mass conversion requires the actual SKU and verified unit mass; rated supported load, gross shipping weight and pad plan area are not pad net mass. |
| interface_count | equipment_interface | Number of items `01846770-4cfe-4a25-8ad9-919d8d378345` | Item(s) | Record actual equipment custody once, including unsuccessful jobs; do not fix its input count to the final reference or purchase the customer equipment again. |

A service packet is countable only with a defined scope and quantity; hourly hire keeps its duration unit and verified support chain. |


## 5. System Boundary

### Boundary Abstraction

| Field | Value |
| --- | --- |
| declared_starting_condition | Customer equipment stopped and isolated at the prepared position; accepted existing support surface, approved loading and pad schedule, authorized lifting arrangement and verified permission for unanchored dry placement |
| starting_condition_role | Customer equipment and existing substrate are physical interfaces; supplied pads enter as new consumables |
| product_classification_scope | Isolation installation only, a narrow part of CPC 54651; excludes machinery installation and acoustic finishing services |
| recursive_input_rule | A purchased isolation subcontract is either a documented external service package or disaggregated foreground work, never both; do not recursively add another complete copy of the same isolation service |
| upstream_dataset_requirement | Supply-chain data for actually consumed pads, packaging, electricity, owned-resource shares and external services at matching gates; no second manufacture of customer equipment or existing building |
| disclosure | Declare which party owns equipment, lifting tools, transport, packaging, rejects and external treatment. Link to a wider project when excluded work is necessary; no claim of a whole machine or building life cycle |

## 6. Process Inventory Structure

### Process Map

| process_id | process_name | inclusion | inclusion_condition | role | quantitative_reference |
| --- | --- | --- | --- | --- | --- |
| place_inspect | Dry placement and loaded inspection | required | Eligible first installation with approved unanchored single-layer neoprene layout | Integrate pads with customer equipment; inspect and retain all correction burdens; release only accepted isolation installation | accepted_isolation |

One node owns local lifting, hand cutting, placement and inspection. Incorrect pad grade, damaged modules, unstable support, an unapproved load distribution or rigid bridging is an off-spec state. Correct within place_inspect and repeat inspection, or classify actual material exit under `usable_returns_pad_module`; `usable_returns_usable_offcut` or `installation_waste_neoprene`. Unresolved rejects have no accepted reference output.

### Process: Dry placement and loaded inspection (`place_inspect`)

#### Inputs

##### Product flows

###### Customer equipment at pad-placement interface (`equipment_interface`)

Record the actual customer-owned machine received for local pad placement and its return at handover. This is an interface/custody exchange; its upstream manufacture is outside this separately declared service and is not an additional purchased machine.

- Selected flow: Customer equipment at pad-placement interface
- Flow property / unit: Number of items / Item(s)
- Amount rule: Actual machines entering the work order, including unaccepted jobs, divided by D
- Value mode: `foreground_record`
- Specificity: `site_specific`
- Normalization basis: per reference flow
- Basis kind: `reference_flow`
- Evidence kind: `collected_record`
- Collection protocol: `cp_gate`

Range evidence need: retain actual machine IDs, receipts and final status. A universal one-input-per-accepted-output ratio would hide unsuccessful work.

###### Modular neoprene vibration-isolation pads at site supply (`neoprene_pads`)

Actual selected neoprene grade and module geometry for single-layer compression placement. Include gross material drawn into the work order, hand-cut losses and replacements. Separate unused returns and waste so receipts are not netted twice.

###### Complete contract-defined local support service package (`contracted_services`)

Apply only when this specific exchange actually occurs within the existing work boundary. Record its exact material or device identity, supplied/current state, native quantity and actual recipient or upstream coverage. Do not infer occurrence, quantity, a new process or a UUID. A complete supplied assembly and its already included components are mutually exclusive purchase views. Activate only for an actual provider-defined complete counted package. This Item(s) card never represents hourly hire or freight workload. Record actual scope and covered burdens once.

## 7. Allocation and Co-product Handling

| rule_id | Applies to | Rule | source_ids |
| --- | --- | --- | --- |
| retain_rework | place_inspect | Keep every repeated lift, cut, replacement and inspection in the originating work order. Unaccepted equipment does not increase D. If D is zero, retain a failed-job inventory without division; connect its burden to an evidenced subsequent service or report it separately. |  |
| materials_and_returns | neoprene_pads; actual exchanges required by `refine_packaging`; `usable_returns_pad_module`; `usable_returns_usable_offcut`; `installation_waste_neoprene` | Track stock and exits by material and ownership. Net procurement may exclude genuinely returned unused supplies only with consistent upstream inventory adjustment; never subtract the same return from input mass and again as avoided production. No displacement credit is supplied here. A genuine sold co-product requires a separately reviewed allocation decision. |  |
| shared_life | `owned_resources_jack`; `owned_resources_sling`; `owned_resources_hand_cutter`; `owned_resources_gauge` | For each actual resource packet, enumerate all consuming nodes, jobs and periods, maintenance/replacement/retirement events and measured causal use. Assign s_j = u_j / sum(u_all); shares over all beneficiaries sum to 1. Do not assign the full purchase to every period or use job-only hours as the whole-life denominator. Missing lifetime activity remains a disclosed blocker, not an assumed default. |  |
| service_ownership | contracted_services; `local_support_hourly_service_handling`; `local_support_hourly_service_access`; installation_electricity | Separate provider-owned resources from owned-resource packets; a packaged service and its embedded energy/assets are mutually exclusive representations of the same burden. Physical custody of reusable packaging does not scale with its upstream burden share. |  |


## 8. Foreground Data Collection, Calculation, and Quality Rules


Use Item(s) only for an actual complete counted provider package and h only for an actual matching hourly service; the same event may use one representation. Actual freight and waste-treatment services retain their own verified physical reference units and separate concrete service exchanges, never a conversion from hours, distance or mass to a fictitious counted event. Shared/provider inclusions and all-consumer attribution remain required.

Retain all original obligations even where a corresponding exchange identity is not yet known. Do not allocate a family total or copy its numerical Range to children, count a carrier and its contained material twice, or turn missing occurrence/quantity/native reference into zero. Each concrete exchange has one property and one unit; other CP readings are auxiliary and require evidenced conversion.

Do not allocate a family total or copy its numerical Range to children, count a carrier and its contained material twice, or turn missing occurrence/quantity/native reference into zero. Each concrete exchange has one property and one unit; other CP readings are auxiliary and require evidenced conversion. Missing required refinement blocks dataset completion. | Item(s) per defined packet; original service unit retained; Item(s); h | each asset or service event | work order and documented whole resource life | all shared consuming sites/jobs and target node | per reference flow | Whole-life packet evidence, shares sum to 1; count packet shares or actual service quantities and divide by D; retain unknown retirement/lifetime evidence as unresolved |
| cp_energy | place_inspect | installation_electricity | meter or charging record | meter_id; start; end; session; owner; charging_losses; attribution_basis; allocated_kWh | Read actual installation-only meters or allocate shared charging using measured session use; exclude separately inventoried provider energy. | kWh | each use or charging session | sessions causally assigned to work order | site supply or evidenced offsite charging | per reference flow | Calibrated readings and session ownership; sum allocated_kWh including losses then divide by D; absent use needs explicit records, not assumed zero |
| cp_exits | place_inspect | `usable_returns_pad_module`; `usable_returns_usable_offcut`; `installation_waste_neoprene` | custody and receiving record | material; condition; quantity; tare; ticket; owner; destination; receiver; treatment_scope; correction_id; concrete_exchange_id; physical_event_id; actual_identity_id; actual_state; receiver_or_provider_gate; native_quantity; native_unit; unique_property; measurement_method_id; uncertainty | Weigh and reconcile separate reusable returns and waste at release, link to actual recipient and originating work-order material. Record each actual child/refined exchange independently by identity, physical event, state, gate and period. Retain all original obligations even where a corresponding exchange identity is not yet known. Do not allocate a family total or copy its numerical Range to children, count a carrier and its contained material twice, or turn missing occurrence/quantity/native reference into zero. Each concrete exchange has one property and one unit; other CP readings are auxiliary and require evidenced conversion. Missing required refinement blocks dataset completion. | kg | each exit | work order and linked later exit | node release and declared receiver gate | per reference flow | Signed tickets and material balance; sum each classified exit mass and divide by D; do not recategorize waste as product for a UUID match |

### Calculation Rules

| rule_id | Applies to | Formula or rule | Inputs | Output | source_ids |
| --- | --- | --- | --- | --- | --- |
| normalization | all non-reference cards | For actual work-order quantity Q_i, q_i = Q_i / D; D > 0. Keep separate quantities for each material, asset packet and real service unit. | Q_i; D; cp_gate; cp_materials; cp_resources; cp_energy; cp_exits | quantity per reference flow |  |
| stock_closure | neoprene_pads; actual exchanges required by `refine_packaging` | For each material, opening stock + receipts = closing unused stock + retained installation material + usable returns + waste + documented discrepancy. Correct attribution and weighing differences; do not force discrepancies into emissions. | cp_materials; cp_exits; installation records | reconciled material inventory |  |
| resource_share | `owned_resources_jack`; `owned_resources_sling`; `owned_resources_hand_cutter`; `owned_resources_gauge` | For each declared whole-life packet, s_j = u_j / sum(u_all); q_resource = s_j / D. Require positive complete denominator, period ownership and no overlapping maintenance or retirement packet. | cp_resources; cp_gate | resource packet share per reference flow |  |

### Data Quality Requirements

| requirement_id | Applies to | Requirement | Evidence |
| --- | --- | --- | --- |
| configuration | accepted_isolation | Keep grade, load distribution, module geometry and design-approved eligibility; separate different designs rather than claiming equal performance. | supplier/project design and signed gate records |
| range_evidence | all cards | Develop quantitative guardrails only from comparable independent measured jobs or verified SKU data. Manufacturer supported-load tables are neither consumed material masses nor installation yields. | card-specific actual evidence and independent sample scope |
| identity | all cards | Resolve actual exchange identity, state, provider/destination, property and unit before final dataset production. A conditional umbrella expands into actual exchanges and never receives an assumed universal UUID. | full matching flow and property/unit evidence |
| periods | `owned_resources_jack`; `owned_resources_sling`; `owned_resources_hand_cutter`; `owned_resources_gauge`; contracted_services; `local_support_hourly_service_handling`; `local_support_hourly_service_access` | Close ownership and period allocations, replacements and retirement; prevent duplicate burdens across jobs and services. | resource life and all-consumer ledger |
| `refine_packaging` | actual independently refined exchanges | Preserve this actual collection and closure scope as a mandatory dataset-production requirement: Expand by actual material and single-use or returnable custody. Do not count packaging already included in a supplier inventory again. Returnable packaging physical mass remains separate from its allocated upstream burden. Range evidence need: actual packing specification, weighing and reuse/custody evidence; gross delivery mass is insufficient. Independently establish every actual identity, state, real provider/receiver and exactly one exchange property/unit before constructing its flow card. Each actual exchange requires its own recorded quantity and applicable method, uncertainty and custody/fate coverage. Auxiliary CP units do not authorize extra exchange views. Actual occurrence unknown is not zero; never invent a material/species/provider list or split a parent total. Quantitative screening evidence must fit each actual exchange; a former family interval cannot be copied or divided into child ranges. Further actual identities not fully specified by the conditional children require mandatory refinement and prevent dataset completion; this requirement is not itself a flow exchange. Actual material/SKU one-use or reusable packaging receipts, retained stock, returns and waste; physical mass and life/burden share separate, supplier-included manufacture once. | `cp_materials`; actual independent records and identity/unit evidence |
| `refine_owned_resources` | `owned_resources_jack`; `owned_resources_sling`; `owned_resources_hand_cutter`; `owned_resources_gauge` | Preserve this actual collection and closure scope as a mandatory dataset-production requirement: For actually used jacks, slings, hand cutters, gauges and other owned assets, define each whole-resource-life packet including procurement, maintenance, replacements and retirement. Allocate its burden using measured causal use across every job/node/period; retain physical asset IDs and avoid recounting provider-owned equipment. Range evidence need: asset-specific whole-life service evidence and actual use logs; no assumed lifetime or fixed equipment-consumption fraction. Independently establish every actual identity, state, real provider/receiver and exactly one exchange property/unit before constructing its flow card. Each actual exchange requires its own recorded quantity and applicable method, uncertainty and custody/fate coverage. Auxiliary CP units do not authorize extra exchange views. Actual occurrence unknown is not zero; never invent a material/species/provider list or split a parent total. Quantitative screening evidence must fit each actual exchange; a former family interval cannot be copied or divided into child ranges. Further actual identities not fully specified by the conditional children require mandatory refinement and prevent dataset completion; this requirement is not itself a flow exchange. Other actual asset functions/models require exact whole-life reference; actual provider-owned equipment excluded. Each equivalent explicitly uses resource_share, not whole purchase per job. | `cp_resources`; actual independent records and identity/unit evidence |
| `refine_local_support_hourly_service` | `local_support_hourly_service_handling`; `local_support_hourly_service_access` | Preserve this actual collection and closure scope as a mandatory dataset-production requirement: Apply only when this specific exchange actually occurs within the existing work boundary. Record its exact material or device identity, supplied/current state, native quantity and actual recipient or upstream coverage. Do not infer occurrence, quantity, a new process or a UUID. A complete supplied assembly and its already included components are mutually exclusive purchase views. Activate only when the actual provider dataset is referenced to service hours with matching scope and complete lifecycle coverage. Do not also count the same event as a whole service package. Time is not a material count. Range evidence need: actual contract scope, trips or hire records and upstream inclusion; no universal count, hours or distance. Independently establish every actual identity, state, real provider/receiver and exactly one exchange property/unit before constructing its flow card. Each actual exchange requires its own recorded quantity and applicable method, uncertainty and custody/fate coverage. Auxiliary CP units do not authorize extra exchange views. Actual occurrence unknown is not zero; never invent a material/species/provider list or split a parent total. Quantitative screening evidence must fit each actual exchange; a former family interval cannot be copied or divided into child ranges. Further actual identities not fully specified by the conditional children require mandatory refinement and prevent dataset completion; this requirement is not itself a flow exchange. Other functions or native references require their actual identity/unit; complete counted and timed views are mutually exclusive for same event. | `cp_resources`; actual independent records and identity/unit evidence |
| `refine_usable_returns` | `usable_returns_pad_module`; `usable_returns_usable_offcut` | Preserve this actual collection and closure scope as a mandatory dataset-production requirement: Conditional actual reusable offcuts, uninstalled pad modules and returnable packaging leaving the work order for a named owner and destination. Distinguish contamination and damage; no automatic sale, co-product or recycling credit. Range evidence need: weighed return tickets, condition and ownership; no assumed recoverable fraction. Independently establish every actual identity, state, real provider/receiver and exactly one exchange property/unit before constructing its flow card. Each actual exchange requires its own recorded quantity and applicable method, uncertainty and custody/fate coverage. Auxiliary CP units do not authorize extra exchange views. Actual occurrence unknown is not zero; never invent a material/species/provider list or split a parent total. Quantitative screening evidence must fit each actual exchange; a former family interval cannot be copied or divided into child ranges. Further actual identities not fully specified by the conditional children require mandatory refinement and prevent dataset completion; this requirement is not itself a flow exchange. Actual reusable packaging products and other returned grades/states require exact identities/receivers; retained work-order stock is not boundary exit. | `cp_exits`; actual independent records and identity/unit evidence |
| `refine_installation_waste` | `installation_waste_neoprene` | Preserve this actual collection and closure scope as a mandatory dataset-production requirement: Expand actual waste by neoprene/material identity, contamination, condition and named receiving treatment gate. Include irrecoverable corrections and captured debris; solid offcuts are waste, not automatically airborne elementary emissions. Disposal services and waste-transfer mass must have compatible nonduplicated treatment ownership. Range evidence need: actual cutting plan, waste tickets and correction history; no preset scrap or recycling fraction. Independently establish every actual identity, state, real provider/receiver and exactly one exchange property/unit before constructing its flow card. Each actual exchange requires its own recorded quantity and applicable method, uncertainty and custody/fate coverage. Auxiliary CP units do not authorize extra exchange views. Actual occurrence unknown is not zero; never invent a material/species/provider list or split a parent total. Quantitative screening evidence must fit each actual exchange; a former family interval cannot be copied or divided into child ranges. Further actual identities not fully specified by the conditional children require mandatory refinement and prevent dataset completion; this requirement is not itself a flow exchange. Actual discarded packaging, other captured debris and contamination/receiver differences need actual roster and independent quantities; no automatic airborne release or recycling credit. | `cp_exits`; actual independent records and identity/unit evidence |
| `atomic_exchange_identity_unit` | all inventory rows | Each concrete flow card identifies exactly one actual independently supplied product/SKU/formulation, complete assembly, complete single-function or genuine complete bounded provider service, actual waste composite/state/receiver, or substance/size/receiving medium, with exactly one property and unit. Different actual identities require independent quantities and records, not a summed family exchange. A complete product/carrier includes its contents once. Same unchanged SKU/state usable supply/return pairs and matched physical internal send/receive pairs use the same selected property/unit; kg and count or MJ and kWh auxiliaries are nonadditive measurements, never duplicate exchanges. Missing identity/occurrence/quantity/native reference is a gap, not zero. Any pooled denominator must retain the original accepted configuration strata, state/gate and causal attribution; do not divide unlike circuits, routes, products or jobs as if they were equivalent. | actual identity, unit, custody and independent quantity evidence |
| `asset_final_normalization_once` | all inventory rows | An asset-equivalent formula already ending in division by N, D or A is the final quantity per reference flow. Its complete-life fraction and accepted-output normalization constitute the same normalization operation as the general normalization rule; never divide it by that denominator again. Apply the complete-life upstream burden exactly once. Actual complete provider event counts remain event quantities, not owned-asset fractions. | actual identity, unit, custody and independent quantity evidence |


## 9. Validation Rules

| rule_id | Applies to | Rule | source_ids |
| --- | --- | --- | --- |
| gate_complete | accepted_isolation | Check supplier/project authorization for no restraint, approved per-support loads and layout, actual contact/level/stability/bridge criteria and correction closure. Missing design approval or inspection criteria blocks acceptance; do not assert a numerical operating attenuation. |  |
| row_completeness | all cards | Verify each actual input, return, waste and conditional service at place_inspect; reconcile material and equipment custody. Actual excluded activities require boundary extension, not silent deletion. |  |
| resource_closure | `owned_resources_jack`; `owned_resources_sling`; `owned_resources_hand_cutter`; `owned_resources_gauge`; contracted_services; `local_support_hourly_service_handling`; `local_support_hourly_service_access` | All consumers and periods must be represented; shares sum to 1 and owned/provider burdens do not overlap. Unknown lifetime, replacement or retirement allocation blocks finalization. |  |
| normalization_check | all cards | D must be positive and exclude rejected jobs. Reference output is exactly 1 Item(s); other quantities come from actual records and are not fixed to one. Preserve real service units, energy and mass conversions. |  |
| exchange_readiness | all cards | Require exact verified identities, property/unit chains and traceable quantities for final exchanges; no checker result substitutes for these records. |  |
| `atomization_packaging_complete` | actual independently refined exchanges | Require independent actual quantity, identity/state/gate and one property/unit for each applicable exchange in this scope; preserve full original protocol, normalization, stock, returns, waste/releases and shared-resource ownership. Reject completion on an unknown required child, unsupported native reference or missing quantity; evidenced nonoccurrence is separate from missing data. No family-total allocation, copied family Range or duplicate carrier/constituent/bundled-part exchange. Completion requires satisfying `refine_packaging` with actual records; unresolved required expansion blocks the dataset. |  |

Reject completion on an unknown required child, unsupported native reference or missing quantity; evidenced nonoccurrence is separate from missing data. No family-total allocation, copied family Range or duplicate carrier/constituent/bundled-part exchange. Completion requires satisfying `refine_local_support_hourly_service` with actual records; unresolved required expansion blocks the dataset. |  |
| `atomization_usable_returns_complete` | `usable_returns_pad_module`; `usable_returns_usable_offcut` | Require independent actual quantity, identity/state/gate and one property/unit for each applicable exchange in this scope; preserve full original protocol, normalization, stock, returns, waste/releases and shared-resource ownership. Reject completion on an unknown required child, unsupported native reference or missing quantity; evidenced nonoccurrence is separate from missing data. No family-total allocation, copied family Range or duplicate carrier/constituent/bundled-part exchange. Completion requires satisfying `refine_usable_returns` with actual records; unresolved required expansion blocks the dataset. |  |
| `atomization_installation_waste_complete` | `installation_waste_neoprene` | Require independent actual quantity, identity/state/gate and one property/unit for each applicable exchange in this scope; preserve full original protocol, normalization, stock, returns, waste/releases and shared-resource ownership. Reject completion on an unknown required child, unsupported native reference or missing quantity; evidenced nonoccurrence is separate from missing data. No family-total allocation, copied family Range or duplicate carrier/constituent/bundled-part exchange. Completion requires satisfying `refine_installation_waste` with actual records; unresolved required expansion blocks the dataset. |  |
| `validate_atomic_exchange_unit_and_normalization` | all inventory rows | Each concrete flow card identifies exactly one actual independently supplied product/SKU/formulation, complete assembly, complete single-function or genuine complete bounded provider service, actual waste composite/state/receiver, or substance/size/receiving medium, with exactly one property and unit. Different actual identities require independent quantities and records, not a summed family exchange. A complete product/carrier includes its contents once. Same unchanged SKU/state usable supply/return pairs and matched physical internal send/receive pairs use the same selected property/unit; kg and count or MJ and kWh auxiliaries are nonadditive measurements, never duplicate exchanges. Missing identity/occurrence/quantity/native reference is a gap, not zero. An asset-equivalent formula already ending in division by N, D or A is the final quantity per reference flow. Its complete-life fraction and accepted-output normalization constitute the same normalization operation as the general normalization rule; never divide it by that denominator again. Apply the complete-life upstream burden exactly once. Actual complete provider event counts remain event quantities, not owned-asset fractions. |  |
