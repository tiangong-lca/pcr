# Existing asphalt runway wet saw-cut transverse grooving services

## 1. Scope and Applicability

This PCR covers wet diamond-saw cutting of transverse rectangular grooves in a qualified existing asphalt runway, with integrated continuous slurry collection, continuous cleanup, attributable setup/control-strip work, actual job-induced defect remediation and accepted maintenance handback. It applies where the actual project adopts FAA AC 150/5370-10H Item P-621 rectangular geometry and testing, with documented project choices. It excludes concrete, plastic-formed or trapezoidal grooves, diamond grinding, major pre-existing pavement rehabilitation, manufacture of a new runway or asphalt layer, drainage and lighting installation, chemical surfacing, and subsequent aircraft or airport operation. Groove acceptance alone does not warrant a friction coefficient, service life or all-weather safety.

## 4. Measurement and Unit Rules

| rule_id | Applies to | Required property | Required unit | Rule |
| --- | --- | --- | --- | --- |
| `accepted_area` | `accepted_grooving` | Area `93a60a56-a3c8-19da-a746-0800200c9a66` | m2 | Survey A as the union of accepted grooved plan-view polygons, excluding omitted edge/light/joint zones, unresolved rejects and untreated gaps. Count repeated passes once. The output amount is exactly 1 m2 per reference flow; all attributable campaign quantities divide by positive A. |
| `groove_geometry` | `accepted_grooving` | Length | mm | Record the adopted project unit system and exact specification. P-621 SI nominal width 6 mm (+2/-0), depth 6 mm (±2), spacing 38 mm (-3/+0), transverse perpendicular orientation; retain actual zone acceptance distributions and alignment criteria instead of using nominal dimensions as resource factors. The printed nominal SI spacing 38 mm (-3/+0) and separately printed acceptance minimum 34 mm are distinct source clauses with an arithmetic discrepancy; retain both verbatim and obtain the adopted project criterion hierarchy/resolution from the responsible engineer before acceptance. Do not silently equate rounded SI/inch clauses or invent a universal corrected limit. |
| `quantity_custody` | actual exchanges required by `refine_fuel_supply`, `diamond_blades_complete_blade`; `diamond_blades_replacement_segment`, `lubricant_supply`, `remedy_materials_asphalt_mixture`; `remedy_materials_binder`; `remedy_materials_sealant`, actual exchanges required by `refine_packaging_supply`, actual exchanges required by `refine_unused_returns` | Mass | kg | Measure product gross issue quantity before outward return netting with vehicle/container tare removed. Record true outward returns, retained closing stocks and consumed/transformed or released amounts by identity. Volume-to-mass needs actual product density at declared temperature; no assumed water or fuel density. |
| `freight_units` | `freight_service` | mass*distance | kg*km | Use net cargo kg times actual route-leg km; conversion from listed t*km uses factor 1000 kg*km per t*km. Do not confuse vehicle distance with cargo transport service. |
| `energy_units` | `electricity_supply` | Energy | kWh | Retain measured electrical kWh and actual supply boundary. Do not substitute heating-value energy for generic electrical Energy identity; fuel mass and electrical energy remain separate physical quantities. |


## 5. System Boundary

### Boundary Abstraction

| Field | Value |
| --- | --- |
| declared_starting_condition | Existing sound stable asphalt runway at authorized airside possession; pre-existing bumps, depressed, badly cracked/spalled or defective zones already repaired by declared owner and accepted for grooving. |
| starting_condition_role | Retained host interface; not a newly supplied complete runway or burden-free incremental work. |
| product_classification_scope | Narrow runway alteration service within CPC 3.0 54213, independent of classification-derived identity. |
| recursive_input_rule | A separately purchased same-category grooving service is recorded at its actual accepted area and supply gate with upstream dataset; do not recursively invent retained-runway manufacture or duplicate subcontractor resources. |
| upstream_dataset_requirement | Actual supplied water, fuels, blades, lubricant, repair products, electricity, transport, packaging, distinct asset service and external treatment use verified compatible upstream/downstream datasets and declared boundary coverage. |
| disclosure | Incoming substrate/condition and prior-repair owner; project adopted P-621 and unit system; campaign/work-window limits; setup/control-strip inclusion; actual remedy responsibility; assets/coverage, supply and receiver gates; omitted areas, weather and stock carry-forward. |

### Boundary Rules

| rule_id | Applies to | Rule | source_ids |
| --- | --- | --- | --- |
| `scope_eligibility` | foreground_system_boundary | This PCR covers wet diamond-saw cutting of transverse rectangular grooves in a qualified existing asphalt runway, with integrated continuous slurry collection, continuous cleanup, attributable setup/control-strip work, actual job-induced defect remediation and accepted maintenance handback. It applies where the actual project adopts FAA AC 150/5370-10H Item P-621 rectangular geometry and testing, with documented project choices. It excludes concrete, plastic-formed or trapezoidal grooves, diamond grinding, major pre-existing pavement rehabilitation, manufacture of a new runway or asphalt layer, drainage and lighting installation, chemical surfacing, and subsequent aircraft or airport operation. Groove acceptance alone does not warrant a friction coefficient, service life or all-weather safety. |  |
| `retained_host` | `groove_finish` | Retain the existing asphalt host without a new whole-runway upstream charge or avoided-replacement credit. Include incremental possession, guides, control strip, wet cutting, capture, cleanup, transport and job-induced remedies. Prior major rehabilitation is separately bounded with explicit responsibility. | `faa-p621-2018` |
| `continuous_capture` | `groove_finish` | Use actual wet diamond-saw cutting with integrated continuous slurry vacuum and continuous cleanup. Account water supply and actual approved residual disposition. No routine slurry entry to airport storm sewer; freezing conditions that prevent immediate debris removal/water drainage preclude this route. | `faa-p621-2018` |
| `equipment_blades` | `diamond_blades_complete_blade`; `diamond_blades_replacement_segment` | Record machine/head and blade configuration appropriate to asphalt hardness, one-pass groove capability, depth/alignment control and uniform blade wear/diameter. P-621 minimum 0.5 m multi-groove pass capability is equipment qualification, not area productivity or water consumption. | `faa-p621-2018` |
| `airside_gate` | `accepted_grooving` | End only after measured geometry/zone acceptance, continuous cleanup complete, residual custody documented, directed damage remedies accepted and signed maintenance handback. Later airport/aircraft operation and friction/service-life claims are outside this output. | `faa-p621-2018` |
| `campaign_asset_boundary` | `capital_service_saw`; `capital_service_vacuum`; `capital_service_recovery`; `capital_service_tanker`; `capital_service_cleaner`; `capital_service_generator`; `capital_service_instrument` | Index campaign possession/work windows, setup/control-strip/rework, manufacturing and service periods of every actual asset, maintenance, replacements and end of life. Saw/vacuum/cleaner/tanker/generator/metrology and actual access/protection/containment/remedy equipment, including bounded provider physical resources, shared with other jobs require complete-life attribution and explicit exclusion of direct fuel, electricity and tool rows from their capital coverage. |  |
| `actual_exchange_expansion` | all inventory rows | Conditional material/service/substance cards are foreground collection obligations. Expand each into distinct actual identity/gate/provider/receiver/property exchange; never bind or add unlike products, wastes, or species together. Record substantiated absence; unknown activity is not zero. |  |


## 6. Process Inventory Structure

### Process Map

| process_id | process_name | inclusion | inclusion_condition | role | quantitative_reference |
| --- | --- | --- | --- | --- | --- |
| `groove_finish` | Coupled wet saw grooving and slurry recovery | `required` | Qualified existing asphalt and approved work possession | Surface finishing from retained sound asphalt to accepted clean grooved area; cutting and recovery are physically coupled | 1 m2 accepted unique footprint |

The campaign consists of recorded daily work windows and passes. Setup, guide lines, off-traffic control strip, cutting, integrated capture, cleanup, zone measurement and actual damage remedies share one responsibility. A cut surface awaiting slurry removal or acceptance is work in progress. It is never an independently handed-over product. No additional node is created solely for documents or testing.

###### Accepted rectangular transverse wet saw grooving service on existing asphalt runway (`accepted_grooving`)

Measure accepted unique plan-view grooved footprint A using georeferenced boundaries and signed zone acceptance; exclusions, rejected areas and unfinished areas do not enter A. Repeated passes cannot increase the footprint. The control strip outside the traffic area has assigned burdens and is not an invented saleable co-product. Range evidence need: The exact 1 m2 quantity defines the reference and is not an empirical yield range. Actual campaign A and measurement uncertainty require surveyed boundaries and acceptance records; no minimum campaign size is asserted.

## 7. Allocation and Co-product Handling

| rule_id | Applies to | Rule | source_ids |
| --- | --- | --- | --- |
| `campaign_attribution` | all inventory rows | Attribute direct campaign records to the accepted footprint A. Setup, approved control strip, machine alignment, cleaning, stoppages and rework retain burdens even when their areas are not accepted saleable output. For mixed work orders, separately meter where feasible, otherwise document causal machine-time/service evidence and sensitivity; price is not a default allocation key. |  |
| `run_attribution` | `groove_finish` | Link every issue, water/energy demand, waste collection, changeover, blade replacement and remedy to machine/head/day/run and work window. Shared setup/cleaning is assigned once to its actual beneficiary runs before campaign summation. Accepted polygons are deduplicated across passes and runs. |  |
| `asset_complete_life` | `capital_service_saw`; `capital_service_vacuum`; `capital_service_recovery`; `capital_service_tanker`; `capital_service_cleaner`; `capital_service_generator`; `capital_service_instrument` | For each asset enumerate all jobs/nodes/reporting periods and complete manufacture, maintenance, replacement and EOL coverage. Use actual campaign service divided by complete-life service with consistent driver, before dividing by A; observed history for completed lives, justified prospective remaining-service/replacement/termination/EOL scenario for in-service assets. Label observed/forecast components, sensitivity, denominator evidence and update triggers; missing coverage or denominator blocks finalization. |  |
| `no_duplicate_burden` | all inventory rows | Retained host is not a newly produced asset. Machine fuel/electricity, diamond blades, lubrication, freight and treatment are owned once: disclose supplier/dataset inclusions and remove overlaps from capital or bundled services. No avoided construction/recycling credit or co-product allocation is assumed. |  |
| `reject_retention` | `groove_finish` | Off-spec geometry, uncleared slurry and damaged pavement remain WIP/reject until directed remedy and acceptance. Rework loops to groove_finish retain all original and repeat burdens; discarded material leaves as identified waste. Unresolved/abandoned zones contribute burdens but never accepted footprint. | `faa-p621-2018` |
| `custody_and_stocks` | all inventory rows | Gross net-tare material/fuel issue is not reduced by outward returns if those returns are outputs. Transfer opening-stock physical quantity and its unconsumed upstream burden from the prior custody/period ledger exactly once; charge newly issued products at their actual supply gate. Attribute used/transformed quantities and actual outward returns/waste/releases without recharging the transferred opening stock. Retained closing-stock physical quantity and its unconsumed upstream burden carry forward to the next period/custody ledger; they do not create outward exchanges. State how the normalized campaign inventory and stock transfers preserve total upstream burden across periods, without losing opening-stock burden or charging closing stock again. Product returns, collected waste and actual environmental release are mutually exclusive outlets; incident spill total is partitioned and not subtracted twice. |  |

P-621 SI alignment ±38 mm over 23 m with realignment every 150 m; retain printed nominal SI spacing 38 mm (-3/+0) and separately printed minimum acceptance spacing 34 mm as distinct clauses; obtain documented adopted project hierarchy/resolution of this discrepancy before accepting spacing. Do not silently harmonize rounded SI/inch values. Zone distributions apply under that declared criterion. Width/depth instruments range ≥12 mm and resolution ≤0.13 mm; spacing range ≥80 mm and resolution ≤0.5 mm. Record actual equivalent inch criteria if adopted, without interchanging rounded thresholds. | m2; mm; m; degree | Every pass spot check and adopted zone-testing frequency; each final acceptance | Entire campaign plus attributable setup/control strip/rework and stock handover | Declared runway, machines/heads, work windows and supply/receiver gates | per reference flow | Calibrated survey and gauges; five zones and five consecutive grooves/head with ≥3 rounds/day; P-621 depth/width distribution ≥90% at least 5 mm, ≥60% at least 6 mm, ≤10% beyond 8 mm under adopted SI system; retain exact specified threshold conventions and corrective adjustments, edge/light/joint exclusions and signatures.

Divide external entries by A; use actual density/temperature only where mass-volume conversion is required. Record each actual child/refined exchange independently by identity, physical event, state, gate and period. Retain all original obligations even where a corresponding exchange identity is not yet known. Do not allocate a family total or copy its numerical Range to children, count a carrier and its contained material twice, or turn missing occurrence/quantity/native reference into zero. Each concrete exchange has one property and one unit; other CP readings are auxiliary and require evidenced conversion. Missing required refinement blocks dataset completion. | m3; kg; kg/m3; degC | Each fill/withdrawal/work window and campaign closure | Entire campaign plus attributable setup/control strip/rework and stock handover | Declared runway, machines/heads, work windows and supply/receiver gates | per reference flow | Meter calibration, tank checks, source/permit/provider documents, paired wet/dry sample and water closure; investigate residuals instead of assuming emission. |

Burned kg = opening + issues - closing - usable outward returns - collected waste - actual environmental release; collected spill appears once within waste and released spill once within release. Total spill is an audit partition, not another subtraction. Normalize input/output and burned activity separately by A. Record each actual child/refined exchange independently by identity, physical event, state, gate and period. Retain all original obligations even where a corresponding exchange identity is not yet known.

Compute campaign service/complete-life service for each asset, then divide by A; service driver must match numerator/denominator. Retired assets use observed full history; operating assets use observed history plus justified remaining service and replacement/termination/EOL scenarios. Record each actual child/refined exchange independently by identity, physical event, state, gate and period.

Record method, engine/load/fuel and uncertainty; air particles require size/composition. Incidents partition total into collected and released; actual water discharge/evaporation needs outlet/measurement and density where converted. Divide actual species mass by A. Record each actual child/refined exchange independently by identity, physical event, state, gate and period. Retain all original obligations even where a corresponding exchange identity is not yet known. Do not allocate a family total or copy its numerical Range to children, count a carrier and its contained material twice, or turn missing occurrence/quantity/native reference into zero. Each concrete exchange has one property and one unit; other CP readings are auxiliary and require evidenced conversion. Missing required refinement blocks dataset completion. | kg; um; declared factor unit; kg/m3; degC | Each applicable work window/test and each incident | Entire campaign plus attributable setup/control strip/rework and stock handover | Declared runway, machines/heads, work windows and supply/receiver gates | per reference flow | Method/factor provenance and applicability; species/compartment resolution; no residual-as-emission, generic NOx/VOC identity or duplication of supplier electricity/freight emissions. |

### Calculation Rules

| rule_id | Applies to | Formula or rule | Inputs | Output | source_ids |
| --- | --- | --- | --- | --- | --- |
| `campaign_normalization` | all inventory rows | Each distinct attributable campaign exchange quantity divided by positive accepted polygon-union A gives its quantity per 1 m2. Reference service is exactly 1 m2. Repeated passes do not enlarge A; failed/abandoned-zone and control-strip burdens remain assigned with disclosed causality. | cp_acceptance; relevant row protocol; distinct campaign exchange quantity; A | Distinct reference-normalized exchange |  |
| `burned_fuel_balance` | actual exchanges required by `refine_fuel_supply`, actual exchanges required by `refine_combustion_emissions`, `spent_fluids_fuel`; `spent_fluids_lubricant`; `spent_fluids_absorbent`; `spent_fluids_wipe`, actual exchanges required by `refine_unused_returns`, actual exchanges required by `refine_liquid_release` | By actual grade burned fuel = opening stock + gross net-tare issues - closing stock - usable outward returns - collected waste - actual release. Total spill partitions into collected and released portions and is not another subtraction. | cp_fuel; cp_materials; cp_residuals; cp_emissions | Burned fuel kg for applicable factors; separate gross input and outlets per reference flow |  |
| `asset_share` | `capital_service_saw`; `capital_service_vacuum`; `capital_service_recovery`; `capital_service_tanker`; `capital_service_cleaner`; `capital_service_generator`; `capital_service_instrument` | Asset-equivalent share = campaign service divided by complete-life service; reference quantity = share divided by A. Use same physical driver and complete life across all jobs/periods, observed plus justified forecast when operating; include complete coverage and exclude direct rows. | cp_assets; cp_acceptance | Item(s) of each concrete asset-equivalent per reference flow |  |
| `cargo_leg_service` | `freight_service` | For each actual provider/mode sum net cargo kg times leg km then divide by A; convert t*km using factor 1000 only. Empty-leg service follows documented actual vehicle dataset boundary. | cp_transport; cp_acceptance | kg*km by actual freight identity per reference flow |  |
| `combustion_species` | actual exchanges required by `refine_combustion_emissions` | For each actual engine/fuel/species, species kg = burned fuel kg times applicable factor kg species/kg fuel, or actual measured species kg; divide by A. Other factor units require evidenced compatible activity conversion before use, not an assumed heating value. | cp_fuel; cp_emissions; cp_acceptance | kg of each identified species/air compartment per reference flow |  |
| `wet_residual_closure` | `captured_slurry`, `spent_blades_complete_blade`; `spent_blades_segment`, actual exchanges required by `refine_liquid_release`, actual exchanges required by `refine_fugitive_particles` | Net wet slurry = measured water + dry solids for the same outgoing lot. Reconcile removed host dry material and blade wear with captured solids, actual escaped particles and residual stock; water balance separately tracks external supply, host moisture, weather, slurry, stock and actual release/evaporation. Unknown residual remains investigation. | cp_water; cp_materials; cp_residuals; cp_emissions | Distinct mass/water closures and flagged uncertainty; no invented emission |  |

Bounded third-party provider physical resources are included once with documented coverage, rather than treating approval paperwork as physical supply. Assets used in several work periods/jobs have complete manufacture, maintenance, replacements and end-of-life coverage; separate direct fuel/electricity and diamond-tool rows are excluded from capital coverage. Range evidence need: Measured service history plus evidenced remaining-service/replacement/termination/EOL scenarios and sensitivity are needed for in-service assets; observed completed life applies to retired assets. Unknown life denominators block finalization. Independently establish every actual identity, state, real provider/receiver and exactly one exchange property/unit before constructing its flow card. Each actual exchange requires its own recorded quantity and applicable method, uncertainty and custody/fate coverage. Auxiliary CP units do not authorize extra exchange views.

Independently establish every actual identity, state, real provider/receiver and exactly one exchange property/unit before constructing its flow card. Each actual exchange requires its own recorded quantity and applicable method, uncertainty and custody/fate coverage. Auxiliary CP units do not authorize extra exchange views.

Different actual identities require independent quantities and records, not a summed family exchange. A complete product/carrier includes its contents once. Same unchanged SKU/state usable supply/return pairs and matched physical internal send/receive pairs use the same selected property/unit; kg and count or MJ and kWh auxiliaries are nonadditive measurements, never duplicate exchanges. Missing identity/occurrence/quantity/native reference is a gap, not zero. Any pooled denominator must retain the original accepted configuration strata, state/gate and causal attribution; do not divide unlike circuits, routes, products or jobs as if they were equivalent. | actual identity, unit, custody and independent quantity evidence |
| `asset_final_normalization_once` | all inventory rows | An asset-equivalent formula already ending in division by N, D or A is the final quantity per reference flow. Its complete-life fraction and accepted-output normalization constitute the same normalization operation as the general normalization rule; never divide it by that denominator again. Apply the complete-life upstream burden exactly once. Actual complete provider event counts remain event quantities, not owned-asset fractions. | actual identity, unit, custody and independent quantity evidence |


## 9. Validation Rules

| rule_id | Applies to | Rule | source_ids |
| --- | --- | --- | --- |
| `check_scope_start` | `groove_finish` | Verify retained existing asphalt scope, incoming soundness, explicit owner of prior repair, current project adoption, approved method/guides/control strip, possession dates and actual weather suitability. Do not import the new-pavement 30-day cure clause as a universal waiting rule for existing qualified asphalt. | `faa-p621-2018` |
| `check_geometry_zone` | `accepted_grooving` | Check documented project resolution/criterion hierarchy for the printed nominal spacing 38 mm (-3/+0) versus separately printed 34 mm minimum acceptance; retain both original clauses without universal correction or silent SI/inch equivalence. Check project-adopted P-621 geometry/alignment, omitted edge/light/joint zones and actual signed sampling results. P-621 uses five widthwise zones, five consecutive grooves near middle blade of every head, each machine/day, at least three measurement rounds/day. Record selected-unit instrument range/resolution and actual acceptance/adjustment thresholds; surface variability can require more tests. | `faa-p621-2018` |
| `check_unique_area` | `accepted_grooving` | Require positive accepted polygon-union A, excluded zones and accepted/rejected/WIP reconciliation, not blade length, void cross section, summed multiple passes or control-strip co-product. Reference/output property is Area, amount 1 m2, support chain verified independently; service UUID unresolved blocks final exchange binding. |  |
| `check_custody_balance` | all inventory rows | Reconcile opening-stock physical quantity/upstream-burden transfer and retained closing-stock carryforward across periods exactly once, then reconcile net-tare gross issues plus opening stocks against outward usable returns, closing stocks, transformation/consumption, collected waste and evidenced release per distinct identity. Burned fuel derives from mutually exclusive outlets. Slurry wet mass, dry solids, water and blade wear reconcile with actual removed asphalt and moisture/weather terms; unknown residual is investigated, not automatic emission. |  |

| `validate_atomic_exchange_unit_and_normalization` | all inventory rows | Each concrete flow card identifies exactly one actual independently supplied product/SKU/formulation, complete assembly, complete single-function or genuine complete bounded provider service, actual waste composite/state/receiver, or substance/size/receiving medium, with exactly one property and unit. Different actual identities require independent quantities and records, not a summed family exchange. A complete product/carrier includes its contents once. Same unchanged SKU/state usable supply/return pairs and matched physical internal send/receive pairs use the same selected property/unit; kg and count or MJ and kWh auxiliaries are nonadditive measurements, never duplicate exchanges. Missing identity/occurrence/quantity/native reference is a gap, not zero. An asset-equivalent formula already ending in division by N, D or A is the final quantity per reference flow. Its complete-life fraction and accepted-output normalization constitute the same normalization operation as the general normalization rule; never divide it by that denominator again. Apply the complete-life upstream burden exactly once. Actual complete provider event counts remain event quantities, not owned-asset fractions. |  |
