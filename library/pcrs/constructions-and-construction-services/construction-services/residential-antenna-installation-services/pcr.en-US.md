# Passive outdoor terrestrial TV antenna installation services

## 1. Scope and Applicability

This PCR covers first installation of a fixed passive outdoor directional antenna for residential terrestrial television reception. The accepted configuration comprises the antenna and matching balun, actual mast/mount, a continuous coax lead-in to one receiver interface, and installation-specific mast and coax grounding or bonding to a declared suitable existing building grounding interface. Aiming, documented acceptance testing and installer handover complete the service. The technical design and locally applicable requirements govern actual work; representative manufacturer guidance supplies route evidence rather than a universal installation layout.

Satellite dishes, indoor antennas, cable-TV supply networks, multiple-outlet distribution, amplifiers, rotators, towers, new lightning-protection systems, new earth electrodes, painting, removal of earlier equipment and subsequent reception/maintenance services are excluded. A reception distance, channel count or lifetime guarantee is not the output. An incompatible site condition or expanded design requires a separately reviewed scope.

## 2. Product Category Identity

| --- | --- |
| canonical_pcr_id | pcr.constructions-and-construction-services.construction-services.residential-antenna-installation-services |
| classification_refs | cpc:3.0:54614; narrower subset only |
| covered_products | Accepted first-installed passive outdoor directional residential terrestrial-TV antenna configuration and single receiver lead-in |
| excluded_products | Satellite, indoor, powered or rotating reception; distribution networks; whole lightning protection and later operation |
| representative_product | Channel Master Advantage 30-series illustrates passive antenna assembly, supplied balun, mast fixing and aiming; actual compatible model governs, without a brand requirement |
| production_route | Receipt and interface verification; antenna assembly; mast and antenna fixing; coax routing/termination/weatherproofing; design-required mast/coax bonding; aiming/testing; correction and retest; accepted handover |
| market_state | Complete site installation at signed installer handover, with actual configuration and tested endpoint |

## 3. Reference Flow

| Field | Value |
| --- | --- |
| What | One complete accepted installation of the disclosed configuration at installer handover |
| How much | 1 Item(s); D is the independently counted positive number of actual complete accepted installations before normalization |
| How well | Declared model, substrate/mount, single lead-in, separate mast/coax bonding design and receiving endpoint satisfy the recorded acceptance criterion; materially different configurations require separate packages or demonstrated equivalence |
| How long or cycle | One receipt-to-acceptance job cycle, including failed work and corrections/retests. Resource acquisition, service/reporting periods, maintenance/replacement and retirement are separately indexed; no operating-year service is claimed |
| reference_flow_link | `accepted_installation` |

| Reference amount | 1 |
| Reference product flow | Accepted passive outdoor directional residential terrestrial-TV antenna installation |
| Reference flow property | Number of items `01846770-4cfe-4a25-8ad9-919d8d378345` |
| Reference unit group | Units of items `5beb6eed-33a9-47b8-9ede-1dfe8f679159` |
| Reference unit | Item(s) |
| Required qualifiers | Actual antenna and balun model/inclusions; passive fixed directional state; mast/mount geometry and substrate; coax SKU/length/route and single receiver endpoint; weatherproofing products; separate mast/coax bonding design and existing grounding interface; jurisdiction/design; target transmitter, actual reception test and acceptance criterion; site/date; signed handover |

Declare every qualifier in the foreground package. Count D from signed complete installations rather than from purchased antennas, visits or tests. Missing acceptance or configuration equivalence prevents normalization.

## 4. Measurement and Unit Rules

| rule_id | Applies to | Required property | Required unit | Rule |
| --- | --- | --- | --- | --- |
| `accepted_count` | reference product | Number of items `01846770-4cfe-4a25-8ad9-919d8d378345` | Item(s) | Use actual independent complete-installation acceptance count D > 0; the final normalized output is 1 Item(s). |
| `material_mass` | mass inventory rows | Mass `93a60a56-a3c8-11da-a746-0800200b9a66` | kg | Measure net supply, return, waste and identified release masses with calibrated records. Count/length-to-mass conversion requires matching SKU and state evidence, not a heterogeneous installation weight. Units of mass `93a60a57-a4c8-11da-a746-0800200c9a66`. |
| `metered_energy` | installation_electricity | Energy | kWh | Preserve actual meter-based electricity and its consumer boundary; power rating, battery Ah, NCV and duration do not measure electrical energy. Exact support identity remains unresolved. |
| `counted_resource` | `owned_equipment_attribution_charger`; `owned_equipment_attribution_rf_tester`; `owned_equipment_attribution_electrical_tester`; `hired_support_service_transport`; `hired_support_service_access`; `hired_support_service_test` | Number of items `01846770-4cfe-4a25-8ad9-919d8d378345` | Item(s) | A reusable asset fraction addresses one identified asset lifecycle packet; a hired event must be a genuine complete contracted service. Actual hourly hire requires Duration support and review. |

## 5. System Boundary

### Boundary Abstraction

| Field | Value |
| --- | --- |
| declared_starting_condition | Materials received and mounting substrate, safe access/power-line clearance, receiver endpoint and suitable existing building grounding interface verified for the actual design. Existing-condition acceptance is readiness, not a new product input or credit. |
| starting_condition_role | Explicit prepared interface at which installer integration responsibility starts |
| product_classification_scope | Selected passive residential terrestrial reception installation is narrower than cpc:3.0:54614; the subclass also covers other antenna/cable/lightning services |
| recursive_input_rule | If a same-category prior installation is purchased, record its actual state and upstream boundary and isolate only genuine new installer work. An unresolved recursive overlap blocks acceptance; do not trace indefinitely or double count the earlier service. |
| upstream_dataset_requirement | Use matching component and service packets with manufacture, inbound delivery, packaging and provider capital inclusions explicitly stated. Include each actual upstream burden once. |
| disclosure | Site/interface approvals, installer supply and handover responsibility, job/period scope, received material custody, actual resource ownership and upstream inclusions/exclusions |

### Boundary Rules

| rule_id | Applies to | Rule | source_ids |
| --- | --- | --- | --- |
| `scope_eligibility` | foreground_system_boundary | This PCR covers first installation of a fixed passive outdoor directional antenna for residential terrestrial television reception. The accepted configuration comprises the antenna and matching balun, actual mast/mount, a continuous coax lead-in to one receiver interface, and installation-specific mast and coax grounding or bonding to a declared suitable existing building grounding interface. Aiming, documented acceptance testing and installer handover complete the service. The technical design and locally applicable requirements govern actual work; representative manufacturer guidance supplies route evidence rather than a universal installation layout. Satellite dishes, indoor antennas, cable-TV supply networks, multiple-outlet distribution, amplifiers, rotators, towers, new lightning-protection systems, new earth electrodes, painting, removal of earlier equipment and subsequent reception/maintenance services are excluded. A reception distance, channel count or lifetime guarantee is not the output. An incompatible site condition or expanded design requires a separately reviewed scope. |  |
| `installer_gate` | install_accept | Own material receipt, assembly/fixing, lead-in termination and weatherproofing, design-required separate mast/coax bonding, aiming, testing, correction/retest and signed handover. The existing grounding system is an interface; new earth electrodes and whole lightning-protection construction are outside scope. | `channelmaster-advantage-installation`; `channelmaster-advantage-support`; `channelmaster-advantage-product` |
| `component_boundary` | component inputs and packaging | Reconcile antenna-included balun/hardware against separate mast, coax, connectors and bonding supplies. Keep physical incoming packaging in the custody ledger even if manufacture is embedded upstream; separately burden only an upstream exclusion. | `channelmaster-advantage-installation`; `channelmaster-advantage-support`; `channelmaster-advantage-product` |
| `resource_boundary` | owned equipment and hired service | Identify actual installer-owned tools, chargers, testers and access equipment and all consumers over each resource lifecycle packet. Contract providers own their asset lifecycle. Distinguish acquisition, service/reporting, maintenance/replacement and termination periods and document missing remaining-use evidence. |  |
| `rework_boundary` | failed work and material exits | A failed aim, fixing or reception test is an unaccepted state within install_accept until corrected/retested. Trace actual repair loop or usable return, downgrade/recovery/discard exit to its originating job and node; an unreviewed downgrade has no accepted output identity. | `channelmaster-advantage-installation`; `channelmaster-advantage-support`; `channelmaster-advantage-product` |
| `posthandover` | receiver operation and later service | End at accepted handover; do not incorporate operational reception electricity, later maintenance or marketing reception guarantees. | `channelmaster-advantage-installation`; `channelmaster-advantage-support`; `channelmaster-advantage-product` |

## 6. Process Inventory Structure

### Process Map

| process_id | process_name | inclusion | inclusion_condition | role | quantitative_reference |
| --- | --- | --- | --- | --- | --- |
| `install_accept` | Install, aim, test and accept passive outdoor antenna | required | Every included job | Integrate independent antenna, mount, coax and bonding roles into the declared accepted installation; own correction/retest and original-event-linked exits | D actual accepted complete installations; normalized output 1 Item(s) |

The sole node owns joining and installation, access and test support. These are responsibilities within one physical service, not fictitious phase outputs. Foreground evidence determines zero, one or multiple concrete exchanges for conditional umbrella cards. Expand actual SKU/state/receiver or substance/air-compartment streams before binding; a mixed material or generic VOC/dust name cannot receive one UUID. Absence requires explicit activity and custody evidence, while missing records remain a gap.

## 7. Allocation and Co-product Handling

No intended co-product is assumed. Keep failed assembly, aiming, tests and corrections with the original installation burden; neither unchanged returns nor discarded parts receive an avoided-production credit. Record every actual reject state and destination, including in-node repair, actual usable return, recovery/discard or a separately reviewed downgrade. Unfinished or failed installations never enter D.

| rule_id | Applies to | Rule | source_ids |
| --- | --- | --- | --- |
| `job_specific` | job materials and corrective work | Assign traceable job-specific supplies, losses, energy and test/retest to that job. Shared actual costs require a documented causal pool; do not allocate by accepted count where physical activities differ. |  |
| `resource_share` | shared equipment and contracted event pools | For resource r and job j, a_rj = A_rj / sum(A_rk) over all benefiting jobs k in the same defined lifecycle/resource packet. Use a consistent causal activity basis, complete consumer coverage, positive denominator and sum(a_rj) = 1. Attribute a_rj / D Item(s) and burden B_r * a_rj / D; uncertain remaining use prevents a final unsupported fraction. |  |
| `period_ownership` | all resource and event packets | Index acquisition/manufacture, each service/reporting period, maintenance, replacement and retirement/termination. Link every input, asset, output and event to period and job and retain the period-specific attribution decision/evidence. A replacement is its own actual event packet. Reconcile each source pool and resource owner once, including other jobs; never duplicate provider capital or annualize without resource evidence. |  |

## 8. Foreground Data Collection, Calculation, and Quality Rules

### Data Collection Protocols

| protocol_id | process_id | flow_role | record_type | raw_fields | collection_method | unit | frequency | temporal_coverage | site_scope | aggregation_rule | quality_evidence |

Retain all original obligations even where a corresponding exchange identity is not yet known. Do not allocate a family total or copy its numerical Range to children, count a carrier and its contained material twice, or turn missing occurrence/quantity/native reference into zero. Each concrete exchange has one property and one unit; other CP readings are auxiliary and require evidenced conversion. Missing required refinement blocks dataset completion. | kg | Each receipt, issue, installation and return | All job receipts and stock movements in stated periods | Installer custody and actual job site | per reference flow | Calibration; SKU/state conversion provenance; upstream inclusion ledger; receiver tickets |
| `cp_energy` | `install_accept` | installation electricity | meter and shared-load activity record | job/period; provider/voltage/site; meter boundary; start/end kWh; tool/test/charger activity; all shared consumers; provider inclusions | Read actual meter or validated submeter; match charging/tests and shared consumers to the same job/period and causal boundary | kWh | Every relevant meter interval and shared activity | All included pre-handover electricity intervals | Actual supply/meter boundary | per reference flow | Meter validity; load-coverage checks; no power/capacity proxy; disclosed exact support gap |

Retain all original obligations even where a corresponding exchange identity is not yet known. Do not allocate a family total or copy its numerical Range to children, count a carrier and its contained material twice, or turn missing occurrence/quantity/native reference into zero. Each concrete exchange has one property and one unit; other CP readings are auxiliary and require evidenced conversion. Missing required refinement blocks dataset completion. | Item(s); actual physical activity units retained | Each resource use, contract event and lifecycle change | Whole resource lifecycle packet plus indexed service/reporting periods | Current installer and all benefiting consumer jobs/nodes | per reference flow | Complete consumer denominator; positive activity; share closure; provider boundaries; unresolved life/Duration disclosure |

Missing required refinement blocks dataset completion. | kg | Each waste exit or release-producing activity | All relevant original/rework events through handover | Actual work location and receiver or receiving-air compartment | per reference flow | Destination tickets; method and uncertainty; species/size/medium support; material balance residual disclosure |

### Calculation Rules

| rule_id | Applies to | Formula or rule | Inputs | Output | source_ids |
| --- | --- | --- | --- | --- | --- |
| `normalize_actual` | all non-reference inventory rows | q_i = n_i / D; n_i is the independently retained actual attributable numerator for the concrete exchange; D is positive actual complete acceptance count. Never backsolve n_i from the reference output. | n_i; D; cp_acceptance; corresponding material/energy/service/release protocol | q_i per reference flow |  |
| `sku_mass` | mass inventory rows | Use measured net kg; when only count or length exists, multiply actual quantity by a traceable matching SKU/state mass factor and preserve its uncertainty. A heterogeneous total is a diagnostic rather than a concrete exchange. | cp_materials; cp_releases; matched conversion evidence | actual kg numerator |  |
| `custody_closure` | identifiable material source pools | Opening stock + receipts = retained installed material + closing stock + usable returns + actual waste + identified releases + disclosed residual. Reconcile each material/source pool, never assign the residual to dust or fill missing data with zero. | cp_materials; cp_releases; original-event and receiver ledger | material pool closure and unresolved residual |  |
| `asset_attribution` | `owned_equipment_attribution_charger`; `owned_equipment_attribution_rf_tester`; `owned_equipment_attribution_electrical_tester`; shared `hired_support_service_transport`; `hired_support_service_access`; `hired_support_service_test` | Apply resource_share to each exact resource pool, retaining A_rj, all A_rk, B_r, consumer/node/period indexing and ownership; divide the attributable actual packet quantity by D. No service-to-mass equivalence exists. | cp_services; cp_acceptance; exact activity and lifecycle evidence | resource fraction or genuine event per reference flow |  |

### Data Quality Requirements

| requirement_id | Applies to | Requirement | Evidence |
| --- | --- | --- | --- |
| `configuration_quality` | accepted output | Document every reference qualifier and configuration equivalence. Product point specifications apply only to the matching model and are not universal service amounts or reception guarantees. | cp_acceptance; manufacturer model instructions |
| `custody_quality` | materials and exits | Retain exact identity, units, calibrated quantities, event/receiver and upstream manufacture/delivery/packaging inclusions; report stock and mass-balance residuals. | cp_materials; cp_releases |
| `resource_quality` | assets and shared services | Complete consumer/period indexing and causal allocation with replacement/termination ownership. Unknown remaining life or incomplete consumers remain explicit finalization blockers. | cp_services; resource_share; period_ownership |
| `conditional_quality` | conditional umbrella exchanges | Require actual activity/custody proof for an absent flow; missing supply, electricity, waste or release evidence is a gap. Actual SKU/species/medium and support must be verified before binding. | All actual protocols; no zero imputation |
| `quantity_quality` | all inventories | Collect actual temporal/site coverage, conversion provenance and uncertainty. Manufacturer sources supply no universal installation Range; preserve card-specific evidence needs rather than inventing bounds. | Calibrations; matched source packets; declared gaps |
| `refine_mast_mount_hardware` | `mast_mount_hardware_mast`; `mast_mount_hardware_bracket`; `mast_mount_hardware_u_bolt`; `mast_mount_hardware_anchor` | Preserve this actual collection and closure scope as a mandatory dataset-production requirement: Expand the actual mast, brackets, U-bolts, anchors and fixings into their own material/SKU exchanges. The accepted substrate and mount geometry control the supply; subtract nothing by guess and do not repeat antenna-bundled hardware. Quantity evidence gap: Actual mounting design, per-SKU conversion and issue/return records are needed; no universal mount mass is supplied. Independently establish every actual identity, state, real provider/receiver and exactly one exchange property/unit before constructing its flow card. Each actual exchange requires its own recorded quantity and applicable method, uncertainty and custody/fate coverage. Auxiliary CP units do not authorize extra exchange views. Actual occurrence unknown is not zero; never invent a material/species/provider list or split a parent total. Quantitative screening evidence must fit each actual exchange; a former family interval cannot be copied or divided into child ranges. Further actual identities not fully specified by the conditional children require mandatory refinement and prevent dataset completion; this requirement is not itself a flow exchange. Other actual fixing SKUs and actual substrate/design-specific material/grade require separate measurement; never duplicate antenna bundled hardware. | `cp_materials`; actual independent records and identity/unit evidence |
| `refine_coax_balun_connectors` | `coax_balun_connectors_coax`; `coax_balun_connectors_connector`; `coax_balun_connectors_extra_balun`; `coax_balun_connectors_receiver_fitting` | Preserve this actual collection and closure scope as a mandatory dataset-production requirement: Expand the actual 75-ohm continuous coax SKU, connectors and receiver fitting for the single declared receiver endpoint. A balun is a separate input only if it is genuinely additional to the antenna packet; record the original inclusion explicitly. Quantity evidence gap: Cable route/length, termination waste and model-specific mass evidence are missing from universal sources and must be collected. Independently establish every actual identity, state, real provider/receiver and exactly one exchange property/unit before constructing its flow card. Each actual exchange requires its own recorded quantity and applicable method, uncertainty and custody/fate coverage. Auxiliary CP units do not authorize extra exchange views. Actual occurrence unknown is not zero; never invent a material/species/provider list or split a parent total. Quantitative screening evidence must fit each actual exchange; a former family interval cannot be copied or divided into child ranges. Further actual identities not fully specified by the conditional children require mandatory refinement and prevent dataset completion; this requirement is not itself a flow exchange. Distinct actual connector models/receiving-interface parts must be separately identified; same cable metres/kg are one physical supply with auxiliary conversion, not two flows. | `cp_materials`; actual independent records and identity/unit evidence |
| `refine_bonding_components` | `bonding_components_conductor`; `bonding_components_clamp`; `bonding_components_coax_ground_block` | Preserve this actual collection and closure scope as a mandatory dataset-production requirement: Expand each actual conductor, clamp and coax grounding block or protective fitting required by the approved design. Document mast/support bonding and coax-entry bonding separately to the suitable existing building grounding interface. This is not a new earth electrode or a whole lightning-protection system. Quantity evidence gap: Site-approved interface/design, actual conductor and fitting SKUs and net supply records must establish any bounds. Independently establish every actual identity, state, real provider/receiver and exactly one exchange property/unit before constructing its flow card. Each actual exchange requires its own recorded quantity and applicable method, uncertainty and custody/fate coverage. Auxiliary CP units do not authorize extra exchange views. Actual occurrence unknown is not zero; never invent a material/species/provider list or split a parent total. Quantitative screening evidence must fit each actual exchange; a former family interval cannot be copied or divided into child ranges. Further actual identities not fully specified by the conditional children require mandatory refinement and prevent dataset completion; this requirement is not itself a flow exchange. Other actual approved protective fittings and different conductor/clamp SKUs require exact product records; mast and coax bonding duties do not duplicate the same issued conductor. No new earth electrode or whole lightning-protection system. | `cp_materials`; actual independent records and identity/unit evidence |
| `refine_weatherproofing_materials` | actual independently refined exchanges | Preserve this actual collection and closure scope as a mandatory dataset-production requirement: Where the installed method uses sealing or weatherproofing, expand each actual product with formulation/SDS and application point. Separate retained material, containers and losses; application does not imply complete evaporation. Quantity evidence gap: Product-specific issue, retained mass and SDS constituent evidence are needed; no generic use or emission interval is supported. Independently establish every actual identity, state, real provider/receiver and exactly one exchange property/unit before constructing its flow card. Each actual exchange requires its own recorded quantity and applicable method, uncertainty and custody/fate coverage. Auxiliary CP units do not authorize extra exchange views. Actual occurrence unknown is not zero; never invent a material/species/provider list or split a parent total. Quantitative screening evidence must fit each actual exchange; a former family interval cannot be copied or divided into child ranges. Further actual identities not fully specified by the conditional children require mandatory refinement and prevent dataset completion; this requirement is not itself a flow exchange. Actual separate complete weatherproofing formulation/SKU and application gate; retained, container and actual release fates, no all-supply evaporation. | `cp_materials`; actual independent records and identity/unit evidence |
| `refine_incoming_packaging` | actual independently refined exchanges | Preserve this actual collection and closure scope as a mandatory dataset-production requirement: Keep the physical packaging receipt in custody accounting for every antenna/component shipment. Expand by actual material. If its manufacture is embedded in landed component supply, do not add that burden again; a separate burden requires evidence that the upstream packet excludes it. Quantity evidence gap: Shipment-specific weights and supplier packaging boundary disclosures must replace any assumed packaging percentage. Independently establish every actual identity, state, real provider/receiver and exactly one exchange property/unit before constructing its flow card. Each actual exchange requires its own recorded quantity and applicable method, uncertainty and custody/fate coverage. Auxiliary CP units do not authorize extra exchange views. Actual occurrence unknown is not zero; never invent a material/species/provider list or split a parent total. Quantitative screening evidence must fit each actual exchange; a former family interval cannot be copied or divided into child ranges. Further actual identities not fully specified by the conditional children require mandatory refinement and prevent dataset completion; this requirement is not itself a flow exchange. Actual packaging custody receipt by material/SKU; retain physical mass if supplier-included, separately charge only uncovered upstream burden, treat durable containers through compatible resource life. | `cp_materials`; actual independent records and identity/unit evidence |
| `refine_owned_equipment_attribution` | `owned_equipment_attribution_charger`; `owned_equipment_attribution_rf_tester`; `owned_equipment_attribution_electrical_tester` | Preserve this actual collection and closure scope as a mandatory dataset-production requirement: Expand every used tool, external charger, RF/electrical tester and access asset by exact model/serial. Its lifecycle packet spans acquisition, service/reporting periods, actual maintenance/replacement and retirement; all benefiting jobs/nodes and periods must be listed, including those outside this package. Quantity evidence gap: Exact resource life and all-consumer activity evidence are required; no generic lifetime, remaining-use assumption or fixed per-job asset fraction is available. Independently establish every actual identity, state, real provider/receiver and exactly one exchange property/unit before constructing its flow card. Each actual exchange requires its own recorded quantity and applicable method, uncertainty and custody/fate coverage. Auxiliary CP units do not authorize extra exchange views. Actual occurrence unknown is not zero; never invent a material/species/provider list or split a parent total. Quantitative screening evidence must fit each actual exchange; a former family interval cannot be copied or divided into child ranges. Further actual identities not fully specified by the conditional children require mandatory refinement and prevent dataset completion; this requirement is not itself a flow exchange. An actual multitype tool/access roster still requires exact model and lifecycle packet; each independent model separate. No lifecycle allocation without actual all-consumer drivers, observed history/remainder/maintenance/replacements/retirement/EOL. Installation tool functions and access-asset types are not a finite single-object roster; require their own actual function/model before a card. | `cp_services`; actual independent records and identity/unit evidence |
| `refine_hired_support_service` | `hired_support_service_transport`; `hired_support_service_access`; `hired_support_service_test` | Preserve this actual collection and closure scope as a mandatory dataset-production requirement: Expand each genuinely purchased complete transport, access or testing event with its contracted reference and configuration. The provider owns its asset lifecycle; disclose included fuel/electricity and inbound delivery. Hourly hire needs real Duration support and review rather than conversion into a fictional event. Quantity evidence gap: Actual contracts, service reference and burden-inclusion records are needed before a service envelope can be stated. Independently establish every actual identity, state, real provider/receiver and exactly one exchange property/unit before constructing its flow card. Each actual exchange requires its own recorded quantity and applicable method, uncertainty and custody/fate coverage. Auxiliary CP units do not authorize extra exchange views. Actual occurrence unknown is not zero; never invent a material/species/provider list or split a parent total. Quantitative screening evidence must fit each actual exchange; a former family interval cannot be copied or divided into child ranges. Further actual identities not fully specified by the conditional children require mandatory refinement and prevent dataset completion; this requirement is not itself a flow exchange. Hourly hire and other actual service references need their own exact identity/property/unit, not event conversion; disclose provider lifecycle/energy/delivery scope. | `cp_services`; actual independent records and identity/unit evidence |
| `refine_unused_product_return` | actual independently refined exchanges | Preserve this actual collection and closure scope as a mandatory dataset-production requirement: Record only actual usable unchanged supplies leaving installer custody. Preserve source SKU and receipt-to-return identifiers and receiver; an internal stock movement is not this boundary exit. No avoided manufacture credit is inferred. Quantity evidence gap: Original issue and receiver-confirmed return evidence must justify the quantity and any bounds. Independently establish every actual identity, state, real provider/receiver and exactly one exchange property/unit before constructing its flow card. Each actual exchange requires its own recorded quantity and applicable method, uncertainty and custody/fate coverage. Auxiliary CP units do not authorize extra exchange views. Actual occurrence unknown is not zero; never invent a material/species/provider list or split a parent total. Quantitative screening evidence must fit each actual exchange; a former family interval cannot be copied or divided into child ranges. Further actual identities not fully specified by the conditional children require mandatory refinement and prevent dataset completion; this requirement is not itself a flow exchange. Actual usable outward product transfer by matching original SKU/receipt/native unit; retained stock and credit excluded. | `cp_materials`; actual independent records and identity/unit evidence |
| `refine_installation_waste` | actual independently refined exchanges | Preserve this actual collection and closure scope as a mandatory dataset-production requirement: Expand packaging, offcuts and removed failed components by material, physical state, hazard and authorised receiving route. Link each discard or recovery to the original install_accept issue/rework event; electronics or battery rejects require their actual identity and lifecycle owner. Do not merge heterogeneous waste into one concrete flow. Quantity evidence gap: Event-linked weighing and destination tickets are needed; unrecorded loss is not zero waste. Independently establish every actual identity, state, real provider/receiver and exactly one exchange property/unit before constructing its flow card. Each actual exchange requires its own recorded quantity and applicable method, uncertainty and custody/fate coverage. Auxiliary CP units do not authorize extra exchange views. Actual occurrence unknown is not zero; never invent a material/species/provider list or split a parent total. Quantitative screening evidence must fit each actual exchange; a former family interval cannot be copied or divided into child ranges. Further actual identities not fully specified by the conditional children require mandatory refinement and prevent dataset completion; this requirement is not itself a flow exchange. Actual segregated solid waste, contaminated carriers, packaging, failed/new and historic origins by independent dispatch; retain native-volume effluent separately when it occurs. | `cp_releases`; actual independent records and identity/unit evidence |
| `refine_contaminated_solid_waste` | `contaminated_solid_waste_container`; `contaminated_solid_waste_wipe`; `contaminated_solid_waste_sealing_residue` | Preserve this actual collection and closure scope as a mandatory dataset-production requirement: Where actually produced, expand chemistry, physical state, hazardous status and receiving route for contaminated containers, wipes and sealing residues. Separate clean packaging already owned by actual exchanges required by `refine_installation_waste` and material retained at joints. Quantity evidence gap: Actual material/SDS, residual weighing and receiver classification are required to establish waste bounds. Independently establish every actual identity, state, real provider/receiver and exactly one exchange property/unit before constructing its flow card. Each actual exchange requires its own recorded quantity and applicable method, uncertainty and custody/fate coverage. Auxiliary CP units do not authorize extra exchange views. Actual occurrence unknown is not zero; never invent a material/species/provider list or split a parent total. Quantitative screening evidence must fit each actual exchange; a former family interval cannot be copied or divided into child ranges. Further actual identities not fully specified by the conditional children require mandatory refinement and prevent dataset completion; this requirement is not itself a flow exchange. Different actual chemistry/hazard/receiver records require separate stream identities; no duplicate retained sealant or clean packaging. | `cp_releases`; actual independent records and identity/unit evidence |
| `refine_airborne_particulate` | actual independently refined exchanges | Preserve this actual collection and closure scope as a mandatory dataset-production requirement: Activate only with evidence of drilling/mounting and actual airborne release. Expand the reported substance and particle-size fraction with receiving-air compartment; captured dust is waste and retained substrate is neither an emission nor unexplained loss assigned to air. Quantity evidence gap: Task/capture records and measured or justified species/size release evidence are needed; generic dust is not an identity or emission factor. Independently establish every actual identity, state, real provider/receiver and exactly one exchange property/unit before constructing its flow card. Each actual exchange requires its own recorded quantity and applicable method, uncertainty and custody/fate coverage. Auxiliary CP units do not authorize extra exchange views. Actual occurrence unknown is not zero; never invent a material/species/provider list or split a parent total. Quantitative screening evidence must fit each actual exchange; a former family interval cannot be copied or divided into child ranges. Further actual identities not fully specified by the conditional children require mandatory refinement and prevent dataset completion; this requirement is not itself a flow exchange. Actual substance, disjoint particle-size fraction and air/water/soil receiving compartment; matched measurement or species/activity factor, whole-fluid composition/fate audit, capture and uncertainty; unknown is not zero. | `cp_releases`; actual independent records and identity/unit evidence |
| `refine_weatherproofing_constituent_to_air` | actual independently refined exchanges | Preserve this actual collection and closure scope as a mandatory dataset-production requirement: Where an actual product releases an identified constituent, record species, formulation/SDS, application conditions, mass-balance or measurement and receiving-air compartment. Neither an unspecified VOC label nor total supplied sealant mass supports a concrete emission. Quantity evidence gap: Species-specific content and release evidence must separate retained, captured, wasted and airborne fractions; no 100 percent emission assumption is supported. Independently establish every actual identity, state, real provider/receiver and exactly one exchange property/unit before constructing its flow card. Each actual exchange requires its own recorded quantity and applicable method, uncertainty and custody/fate coverage. Auxiliary CP units do not authorize extra exchange views. Actual occurrence unknown is not zero; never invent a material/species/provider list or split a parent total. Quantitative screening evidence must fit each actual exchange; a former family interval cannot be copied or divided into child ranges. Further actual identities not fully specified by the conditional children require mandatory refinement and prevent dataset completion; this requirement is not itself a flow exchange. Actual substance, disjoint particle-size fraction and air/water/soil receiving compartment; matched measurement or species/activity factor, whole-fluid composition/fate audit, capture and uncertainty; unknown is not zero. | `cp_releases`; actual independent records and identity/unit evidence |
| `atomic_exchange_identity_unit` | all inventory rows | Each concrete flow card identifies exactly one actual independently supplied product/SKU/formulation, complete assembly, complete single-function or genuine complete bounded provider service, actual waste composite/state/receiver, or substance/size/receiving medium, with exactly one property and unit. Different actual identities require independent quantities and records, not a summed family exchange. A complete product/carrier includes its contents once. Same unchanged SKU/state usable supply/return pairs and matched physical internal send/receive pairs use the same selected property/unit; kg and count or MJ and kWh auxiliaries are nonadditive measurements, never duplicate exchanges. Missing identity/occurrence/quantity/native reference is a gap, not zero. Any pooled denominator must retain the original accepted configuration strata, state/gate and causal attribution; do not divide unlike circuits, routes, products or jobs as if they were equivalent. | actual identity, unit, custody and independent quantity evidence |
| `asset_final_normalization_once` | all inventory rows | An asset-equivalent formula already ending in division by N, D or A is the final quantity per reference flow. Its complete-life fraction and accepted-output normalization constitute the same normalization operation as the general normalization rule; never divide it by that denominator again. Apply the complete-life upstream burden exactly once. Actual complete provider event counts remain event quantities, not owned-asset fractions. | actual identity, unit, custody and independent quantity evidence |

## 9. Validation Rules

| rule_id | Applies to | Rule | source_ids |
| --- | --- | --- | --- |
| `acceptance_gate` | reference and install_accept | Verify actual scope/interfaces, all qualifiers, positive independent D, signed complete output and correction/retest closure. Match reference link/name/property/unit to accepted_installation and require explicit 1 Item(s). Failed/unfinished work stays outside D. | `channelmaster-advantage-installation`; `channelmaster-advantage-support`; `channelmaster-advantage-product` |
| `stream_gate` | inventory and material exits | Check every actual SKU/state/receiver stream, material-pool custody closure and original reject/rework/exit linkage. Separate retained weatherproofing, captured waste and identified airborne species/size/medium; generic dust/VOC is insufficient. Missing evidence is inconclusive, not zero. |  |
| `resource_gate` | resource and period packets | Check all consuming jobs/nodes and periods, actual activity denominators and share closure, period-specific decisions and replacement/termination evidence. Reconcile acquisition, provider capital, delivery, packaging and shared energy once; unresolved remaining use blocks finalization. |  |
| `binding_gate` | reference and concrete exchanges | Verify exact identity and compatible support chain before each final exchange. Register unresolved identities separately; confirm bilingual semantics, source/protocol/calculation links and projection fingerprints. Report performed/skipped checks, findings and completeness distinctly; a mechanical check does not establish publication readiness or resolved UUIDs. |  |
