# Power plant construction and handover

## 1. Scope and Applicability

This PCR addresses the physical construction and agreed acceptance handover of complete heavy electrical generating plants, including nuclear plants, as identified by UN CPC 3.0 53262. Select the actual thermal, nuclear, hydro, wind or solar configuration and declare plant/site interfaces; a code alone does not define construction technology. The reference is the delivered construction entity, not a construction service, manufactured material, generator alone or electricity generation. (`un-cpc-power-plants-2025`)

Factory manufacture of supplied materials/equipment is linked upstream. Standalone industrial buildings, dams, water-treatment works and external long-distance/local grid networks have their own boundaries; integrate an actual component once without duplicating its standalone dataset. The core covers actual civil/mechanical/electrical completion and cold testing, with hot/fuelled acceptance and all later operating/maintenance/demolition stages explicitly outside or separately extended. Handover before fuel loading is not commercial readiness.

## 4. Measurement and Unit Rules

| rule_id | Applies to | Required property | Required unit | Rule |
| --- | --- | --- | --- | --- |
| reference_count | reference product | Number of items `01846770-4cfe-4a25-8ad9-919d8d378345` | item | cp_handover records one accepted complete plant with consistent identity, actual configuration and declared stage; all quantities retain the same declared reference flow. |
| geometry_capacity | reference configuration | Area `93a60a56-a3c8-19da-a746-0800200c9a66` | m2 | Survey footprint/building/foundation and route-specific waterway geometry from as-built records in cp_handover; capacity, AC/DC basis, head, discharge and dimensions remain separate actual qualifiers. No assumed kg per plant, area or MW conversion. |
| material_mass | fresh_concrete; rebar; structural_section; hydraulic_grout; diesel; sea_intake | Mass `93a60a56-a3c8-11da-a746-0800200b9a66` | kg | Use actual mass; convert a measured volume only with independently supported density for the exact material, temperature, salinity/moisture and state. Sea intake retains primary Mass and a parallel volume balance. cp_civil, cp_utilities and cp_environment preserve original measurements. |
| electricity_energy | lv_power; mv_power | Net calorific value `93a60a56-a3c8-11da-a746-0800200c9a66` | MJ | Retain Net calorific value and exact 3.6 MJ/kWh conversion, actual CN supply and specified voltage; actual on-site generation does not inherit this grid identity. |
| water_volume | supplied_water; river_intake; groundwater_intake; freshwater_discharge; sea_return; washout_liquid | Volume `93a60a56-a3c8-22da-a746-0800200c9a66` | m3 | Measure actual volume and preserve source/destination, physical state, internal transfers and pollution sampling. Resource, supplied product, liquid waste and discharge are not interchangeable. |
| module_area | poly_module; mono_module | Area `93a60a56-a3c8-19da-a746-0800200c9a66` | m2 | Preserve module Area/m2, with actual gross-area definition, dimensions/count and rating. The linked upstream dataset must use the same module-area convention or an independently evidenced conversion; unknown gross/aperture/cell-area relationship requires review. Secondary property meanValue=1 does not imply one module equals 1 m2. Area does not identify station area or permit rewriting the public property to Mass. |
| cable_length | lv_cable | Length `838aaa23-0117-11db-92e3-0800200c9a66` | m | Preserve measured cable Length/m and actual supplied specification; do not use a generic copper mass conversion. |
| freight_quantity | road_freight | mass*distance `118f2a40-50ec-457c-aa60-9bc6b6af9931` | t*km | Actual cargo tonnes times actual route kilometres using cp_transport; preserve the public mass*distance group reference kg*km and its documented t*km unit, 1 t*km = 1000 kg*km. Road freight is not the reference product mass. |

## 5. System Boundary

### Boundary Abstraction

| Field | Value |
| --- | --- |
| declared_starting_condition | Actual surveyed site before attributable construction, with received materials and components at explicit supplier/site interfaces and original condition documented |
| starting_condition_role | foreground_starting_point |
| product_classification_scope | Complete constructed power-plant entity with integral actual generating works; CPC provides category context only |
| recursive_input_rule | Existing plant or reused component enters once in its actual inherited state; record inherited burdens and new measured work without recursively reconstructing the same plant category |
| upstream_dataset_requirement | Separate compatible manufacture, supplied-state and transport links; disclose every gap and included gate |
| disclosure | Actual construction and cold-test handover foreground; upstream full coverage not presumed; hot/fuelled tests, routine generation, maintenance and later demolition excluded unless separately defined |

| rule_id | applies_to | rule | source_ids |
| --- | --- | --- | --- |
| construction_scope | dataset; inventory | Include the actual complete agreed plant construction from surveyed starting site through signed civil/mechanical/electrical handover, with integral foundation and generating equipment. Record delivery gate and cold-test stage; this is a construction entity, not a building service or bag of materials. | `un-cpc-power-plants-2025`; `iaea-nuclear-construction-2011` |
| route_completeness | dataset; inventory | Use the installed design branch, not every example row. Complete its work-package BOM: foundation and material state, generating unit, auxiliary cooling/water/fuel handling, pollution-control hardware, electrical/control/safety, connections, tests and temporary removal. Add every missing specific atomic exchange and supplier link before claiming complete inventory; unsupported branches remain a review gap. | `iaea-nuclear-construction-2011`; `ifc-thermal-power-2008`; `ifc-hydropower-2018`; `doe-wind-siting-2021` |
| upstream_interfaces | dataset; inventory | Separate supplier manufacturing, attributable supply transport and measured site construction. Received components carry their actual delivered state; raw metal is not added again when a purchased fabricated assembly includes it. Upstream datasets are separately linked with actual formulation, geography, technology and gate; missing links prohibit a complete cradle-to-gate claim. | `ifc-biomass-construction-2017` |
| handover_and_operation | dataset; inventory | The core endpoint is the actual agreed construction-completion/cold-commissioning handover, with stage and unfinished tests disclosed. It does not establish commercial generating readiness or nuclear licensing. Fuel loading, nuclear startup, hot performance operation and trial electricity/heat exports require a separate fully specified extension with each actual fuel, water, chemical, emission and output; never silently omit included hot tests or blend routine operation. | `ifc-biomass-construction-2017`; `iaea-nuclear-construction-2011` |
| later_stages | dataset; inventory | Routine generation, maintenance/renewal, reservoirs operational emissions, later decommissioning/demolition, downstream waste treatment and future recovery credits are outside the core. Existing-site demolition/remediation and removal of temporary construction works, if actually undertaken, are separate included work packages with measured flows. Declare land/ecology disturbance, noise/vibration, sediment and thermal releases and their unmeasured coverage; they are not fabricated mass emissions. | `ifc-hydropower-2018`; `doe-wind-siting-2021` |
| water_identity | dataset; inventory | Keep supplied water, direct river/ground/sea resource intake, internal reuse, captured liquid waste and direct recipient discharge separate. Actual pollutant species/medium and physicochemical state require their own atomic rows. No default density, emission factor, dilution credit or zero for missing measurements. | `ifc-hydropower-2018`; `epa-concrete-washout-2012` |

All cards below are individually conditional on actual configuration/activity. Required processes must account for their complete actual design, even where the example card is absent or an identity is unresolved. Retain specific additional rows before a dataset claims completeness. Each shared utility amount is allocated by measured process/equipment logs once.

## 7. Allocation and Co-product Handling

| rule_id | applies_to | rule | source_ids |
| --- | --- | --- | --- |
| direct_activity | dataset; inventory | First assign materials, metered energy and work packages directly to the actual plant. For shared batching, workforce equipment or deliveries use recorded beneficiary activities/loads and explain the physical relationship; neither plant cost nor assumed annual generation supplies the denominator. Missing relationship requires review. |  |
| shared_assets | dataset; inventory | For each equipment or reusable form/component retain a persistent manufacture-burden ledger across every project and period. Attribute measured asset amount times evidenced use share; the cumulative shares must be ≤1 and operating energy is separate. Record actual hours/cycles or supported whole-asset denominator and beneficiaries; unknown future life/capacity remains an explicit review, not a fresh full burden at every project. |  |
| multipurpose_works | dataset; inventory | Shared dam, reservoir civil works, access and grid interfaces must be assigned once with project-specific causal/service evidence among actual beneficiaries; shares conserve the entire included construction burden. State unallocated/missing scope. Independently imported component datasets must not duplicate plant foreground works. |  |
| residuals | dataset; inventory | Separate reusable material/product transfers from segregated waste and actual disposal. Do not net avoided virgin manufacture or future recovery into core construction. A hot-test electricity/heat extension records actual useful outputs and its independent allocation basis; trial export does not turn construction reference quantity into kWh. |  |

These attribution rules require the explicit foreground measurement and cross-project evidence of cp_assets and the relevant work-package protocols; they supply no external default share, lifetime or substitution factor.

| calc_reference | all inventory rows | Aggregate each attributable atomic quantity for this same accepted entity. q = Q / N, where N = 1 complete delivered plant; q is per declared reference flow. Do not divide by assumed plant mass, lifetime, cost or generated electricity. | cp_handover | per declared reference flow |  |
| calc_electricity | lv_power; mv_power | E_MJ = E_kWh * 3.6; preserve actual meter/gate and allocate construction energy once. | cp_utilities | MJ per declared reference flow |  |
| calc_density | fresh_concrete; diesel; sea_intake | Mass in kg = measured volume times independently evidenced same-material/state density in compatible units; retain raw volume and density provenance. Unknown density is review, not a guessed factor. | cp_civil; cp_utilities; cp_environment | kg per declared reference flow |  |
| calc_freight | road_freight | Sum actual cargo tonnes * actual route kilometres by leg, with supported shared-load and return convention; distinguish raw vehicle-km from t*km and included supply freight. | cp_transport | t*km per declared reference flow |  |
| calc_modules | poly_module; mono_module | For each same-configuration module lot, multiply measured gross area per module by attributable consumed count = gross attributable receipts + opening stock - verified returns/transfers - closing reusable stock; sum across lots under the same gross-area convention. Include modules consumed by damage, rejection and rework before acceptance. Record accepted installed area and count separately; reconcile discarded modules under cp_waste without subtracting their manufacture burden. Rated capacity and electricity remain distinct qualifiers/outputs. | cp_renewable | m2 per declared reference flow |  |
| calc_attribution | plywood_form; excavator; mobile_crane | Attributable asset manufacture = measured asset amount * evidenced share; cumulative shares across every beneficiary and period ≤1. Keep physical transfer ledger and operating fuel separate; unsupported use/lifetime denominator is review. | cp_assets | attributed asset amount per declared reference flow |  |
| calc_releases | fossil_co2; nitrogen_monoxide; nitrogen_dioxide; pm_fine; pm_coarse | Use measured emitted species mass or an independently supported source-specific site model. Fossil CO2 may use measured oxidized fossil carbon * 44/12 with composition/oxidation evidence; molecular NO and NO2 require independent speciation, and PM fractions are disjoint. No universal engine/plant emission factors are given. | cp_environment | kg per declared reference flow |  |

### Data Quality Requirements

| requirement_id | Applies to | Requirement | Evidence |
| --- | --- | --- | --- |
| configuration | reference product | Actual generating route, complete installed BOM, geography, capacity/geometry and delivery stage must describe the same identified plant. | cp_handover; cp_civil; cp_thermal; cp_nuclear; cp_hydro; cp_renewable |
| coverage | all inventory rows | Cover every actual work package, subcontracted interval and relevant route; disclose missing measurements, components, unsupported identities and all excluded stages without claiming complete lifecycle. | cp_handover; construction records; supplier gates |
| metrology | all inventory rows | Retain calibration, raw basis/state, density/composition provenance, dimensional consistency and uncertainty; no default mix, site consumption, plant mass or life. | cp_civil; cp_utilities; cp_environment; cp_transport |
| attribution | temporary; hydro; electrical | Persistent asset and multipurpose civil/interface allocations conserve burdens across all beneficiaries; unresolved denominator or scope stays review. | cp_assets; original project allocation ledger |
| source_limits | dataset | Historical technical sources support qualitative construction/route facts only, not current permission, default recipe, lifetime or emission factor. Nuclear, biomass, hydro, wind and solar case scopes must not be silently extended. | `un-cpc-power-plants-2025`; `iaea-nuclear-construction-2011`; `ifc-thermal-power-2008`; `ifc-biomass-construction-2017`; `ifc-hydropower-2018`; `doe-wind-siting-2021`; `ifc-mocuba-solar-2016`; `epa-concrete-washout-2012` |

## 9. Validation Rules

| rule_id | applies_to | rule | source_ids |
| --- | --- | --- | --- |
| identity_gate | dataset; inventory | Require one actual constructed power-plant entity, its generating route and all mandatory qualifiers. Verify every adopted identity against material/specification, geography, state, route, primary property and unit group; unresolved identity is not a substitution licence. |  |
| measurement_gate | dataset; inventory | The final output is exactly 1 item/件 and every inventory/protocol basis is the same declared reference flow. Reconcile measured geometry, capacity, count and delivery state; never infer mass per plant, life, energy yield or a universal mix. Preserve Mass, Area, Length, Volume and energy identities and evidence for any conversion. |  |
| completeness_gate | dataset; inventory | Match every actual required/conditional design work package to its atomic rows, original records and upstream/transport interfaces. Missing components, unmetered work, hot tests within the accepted scope, unknown allocations or conversions and unsupported routes remain review gaps and prohibit a complete result; genuine absence requires design evidence. |  |
| environment_gate | dataset; inventory | Check independent source/species/medium evidence before direct elementary exchanges, including fossil share, molecular NO/NO2, disjoint PM fractions and water receptor. Captured sludge/liquid is waste, internal recirculation is not intake, and noise/concentration is not assumed emitted mass. Missing observation is not zero. |  |
| attribution_gate | dataset; inventory | Reconcile each persistent asset and shared dam/connection ledger across all users, projects and periods; cumulative manufacture shares ≤1 and complete attribution sums to the whole declared burden. Retain actual gates and eliminate duplicate raw materials, equipment packages, fuel services and freight. |  |
| handover_gate | dataset; inventory | Require dated signed construction acceptance, geometry/configuration and outstanding-tests list. Independent structural, electrical, nuclear, environmental or regulatory acceptance must be evidenced where claimed; PCR inspection establishes none of these approvals. Report performed/skipped checks, findings, uncertainty and covered/excluded stages. |  |

## 10. Published Dataset Profile

| Field | Value |
| --- | --- |
| dataset_role | foreground_construction_dataset |
| downstream_use | Explicit construction contribution to a plant infrastructure model with separately matched upstream components and separately assessed operation/end of life |
| allowed_use | The measured actual plant/site/configuration/acceptance period and compatible comparisons with the same functional/coverage definitions |
| excluded_use | Generic mass-based power-plant material, unqualified per-kWh operation, default lifetime/capacity/recipe, whole lifecycle or licensing/approval claim |
| required_metadata | All reference qualifiers; actual work packages, initial state and scope; original unit/gate/identity bindings; measured geometries and capacity; asset/shared interface ledger; cold/hot and fuel-load status; signed handover dates |
| required_quality_disclosure | Performed/skipped checks, unmetered and unsupported scope, unresolved identity/allocation/conversion, uncertainty, supplier links and excluded operating/maintenance/demolition stages |
| update_trigger | Actual configuration, site, component/supply gate, method evidence, measurement, acceptance stage or attributable work changes |
