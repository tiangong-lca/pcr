# Multi-dwelling and community residential building delivery

## 1. Scope and Applicability

The product is the physical residential building delivered at its actual site: buildings with three or more dwellings, and residential buildings for communities such as elderly/student residences, workers’ hostels, orphanages and homeless shelters. Community residences are included by their residential function, not by inventing three self-contained dwellings. Hospitals, hotels, construction services and loose building components are outside this category; mixed uses require documented applicability and separately identified scope. No particular structure, height, lift, kitchen or care equipment is universally mandatory.

The foreground covers actual site preparation, foundation/structure, envelope, declared fixed installations and fit-out, site logistics, testing and acceptance. Complete, shell-and-core and other delivery states must be distinguished. Whole-building accounting includes common circulation, stairs, shared cores, actual central services and community spaces delivered in the contract. Upstream construction-product manufacture is separately linked; delivery transport and site construction remain distinguishable. Operational utilities, actual later maintenance/replacements, demolition and final waste destinations are excluded later stages, not a hidden assumed lifetime. A construction inventory alone is neither a complete cradle-to-gate nor a whole-life assessment.

## 2. Product Category Identity

| Field | Value |
| --- | --- |
| canonical_pcr_id | pcr.constructions-and-construction-services.constructions.multi-dwelling-and-community-building-delivery |
| classification_refs | CPC 3.0 53112 |
| covered_products | Delivered multi-dwelling buildings and community residential buildings, with all declared private/common fixed works |
| excluded_products | One-/two-dwelling houses; non-residential institutions; hotels; mobile accommodation; construction/renovation services; loose materials and equipment |
| representative_product | One surveyed residential building with its actual dwelling/room/capacity schedule and common facilities |
| production_route | Actual masonry, concrete, steel, timber or mixed assembly; site and prefabrication gates explicitly recorded; no generic recipe |
| market_state | Immovable residential asset at signed physical delivery condition |

## 3. Reference Flow

| Field | Value |
| --- | --- |
| What | Provide the delivered physical building for its documented residential/community use |
| How much | One whole building; actual dwelling/room count, resident capacity, gross internal floor area, private residential area, common circulation/facility area, footprint, storeys and dimensions |
| How well | As-built structural/envelope specification, private/common installations, accessibility/fire/service performance specified by the project and documented inspection; no inferred legal approval |
| How long or cycle | One construction-and-handover cycle; no default service life or dwelling-years. Later service comparisons require evidence-backed periods and scenarios |
| reference_flow_link | reference_building |

| Field | Value |
| --- | --- |
| Reference amount | 1 |
| Reference product flow | Completed multi-dwelling or community residential building |
| Reference flow property | Number of items `01846770-4cfe-4a25-8ad9-919d8d378345` |
| Reference unit group | Units of items `5beb6eed-33a9-47b8-9ede-1dfe8f679159` |
| Reference unit | item |
| Required qualifiers | project/site; residential use; dwelling/room count and actual capacity; survey method and area breakdown; structure/foundation and ground conditions; height/storeys; as-built materials; private/common delivery completeness; central plant capacities and served zones; accessibility/fire acceptance records; shared basement/site attribution; dates; upstream and A4/A5 coverage; excluded later stages |

item denotes the public Item(s) unit: one building, not one apartment or resident. Required qualifiers must be present in the actual dataset. Building area is surveyed descriptive geometry, not an assumed conversion of housing function. The reference UUID is unresolved because the named public category uses Mass and no building-specific mass-to-count evidence is established. Do not rewrite that public property or invent a building mass.

## 4. Measurement and Unit Rules

| rule_id | Applies to | Required property | Required unit | Rule |
| --- | --- | --- | --- | --- |
| reference_count | reference product | Number of items `01846770-4cfe-4a25-8ad9-919d8d378345` | item | Use cp_handover for one actual accepted whole building. All exchanges use the same declared reference flow; apartment counts never multiply common structure burdens. |
| geometry | reference product | Area `93a60a56-a3c8-19da-a746-0800200c9a66` | m2 | Collect cp_geometry survey definitions and private/common/service area breakdown. Reconcile included floor plates without double-counting corridors; keep footprint, gross internal and usable areas distinct. Area reporting is supplementary and cannot imply equal dwelling function. |
| energy | lv_electricity; mv_electricity; site_diesel | Net calorific value `93a60a56-a3c8-11da-a746-0800200c9a66` | MJ | Preserve actual Net calorific value property and reference energy unit. Metered electricity kWh is multiplied by 3.6 to MJ; fuel requires actual batch net calorific value and measured mass/density. No default fuel factor. |
| physical_quantities | all inventory rows | Actual row reference property | row unit | Retain each measured mass, area, volume, item or transport quantity in its real property. Conversions need material-specific measurements, thickness/density and physical-state evidence; volume of soil or washwater is not abstracted-resource water. |

## 5. System Boundary

### Boundary Abstraction

| Field | Value |
| --- | --- |
| declared_starting_condition | Recorded initial site and supplied product gates, including actual enabling works and retained structures |
| starting_condition_role | foreground_start |
| product_classification_scope | Multi-dwelling and community residential physical building entity |
| recursive_input_rule | A retained/reused same-category structure is a separately identified existing asset input with declared burdens and condition, not a second new whole-building output |
| upstream_dataset_requirement | Link every actual supplied atomic material/component to unit/state/gate-compatible manufacturing evidence; identify missing supplier/background coverage |
| disclosure | Separate upstream manufacture, inbound transport, site construction, initial demolition if any, waste routing and excluded use/maintenance/final demolition; declare common/site works attribution |

| rule_id | applies_to | rule | source_ids |
| --- | --- | --- | --- |
| boundary_delivery | all inventory rows | Account for the delivered whole entity and every actually occurring exchange in shell, core, private and communal works. These conditional rows are minimum inspection prompts, not a closed universal bill of materials. Add separate atomic rows for actual roof coverings, fittings, stairs, external works, heat/cooling plant, community kitchens, security/fire systems and their specific materials when present. No alternative is silently substituted or omitted. | jrc-levels-boq-2021; rics-wlca-2024 |
| boundary_consumed_inputs | permanent/consumed supplied materials and assemblies; excludes reusable-asset manufacture | Local installed, delivered, commissioned or as-built wording specifies the intended route/configuration and acceptance evidence; it does not exclude attributable materials or assemblies consumed in attempted installation, damage, rejected-and-scrapped work or replacements before acceptance. In each native unit, consumed input = attributable gross receipts + opening stock - verified returns/transfers - closing usable stock. Retain actual supplied identity/configuration and assembly inclusions, with failed/replaced items traced to their own identity rather than the final replacement identity. Reconcile accepted installation and waste separately. Verified returns/usable surplus are excluded from consumption, but their attributable transport/handling/rework remains. This equation does not measure reusable equipment/formwork manufacture: retain section 7 conserved lifetime-use shares even when assets are returned/transferred/held in closing stock, and never charge the same asset as both full consumption and a use share. |  |
| boundary_stages | dataset | Manufacture of installed equipment/materials is upstream; fitting, lifting, site conditioning, pressure tests and commissioning are foreground. Operation, real future maintenance/renewal and final dismantling are separately scoped later stages. Initial site demolition and clearance are construction-enabling activities when actually undertaken, not future demolition. Disclose missing A1–A3/A4/A5 coverage. | rics-wlca-2024 |
| boundary_common | common_facilities | Include actual shared stairs, cores, plant rooms and residential-community facilities in the whole-building ledger, even if separately contracted. Identify central systems and served zones. For linked buildings with shared basements, establish a combined assessment ledger before attributing building shares; disclose the parent assessment and conservation. Do not hide all shared works outside private apartment area.  For permanent common-facility supplied inputs, local installed/commissioned wording specifies intended configuration and route, not successful installation as a condition for counting manufacture. Include attributable pre-acceptance damage, scrapped rejects, cutting losses and replacement consumption under cp_common_facilities; verified returns and reusable unused stock are not consumed inputs. Native-unit input = gross attributable receipts + opening stock - verified returns/transfers - closing usable stock. Accepted installation and actual wastes are separate reconciled records. This consumption formula excludes reusable temporary equipment/formwork manufacture, which retains allocation_reuse lifetime shares. | rics-wlca-2024 |
| boundary_releases | site_utilities | Record technical supplied water separately from natural resource intake; track dewatering returns by destination and chemistry. Washout liquid/solids are not freshwater. Inventory actual direct exhaust/dust/discharges only with release evidence; assess construction noise using actual equipment/receptor/time evidence and disclose characterization gaps without inventing a mass flow. | epa-concrete-washout-2012; epa-construction-dust-2010 |

## 7. Allocation and Co-product Handling

| rule_id | applies_to | rule | source_ids |
| --- | --- | --- | --- |
| allocation_whole | dataset | The reference is one building. Private apartments/rooms, cores and common facilities are components, not co-products automatically requiring division by dwelling count. Keep the whole-building inventory. Supplementary dwelling/room reports must preserve the building total and identify common-space assignment. | rics-wlca-2024 |
| allocation_shared | all inventory rows | First subdivide meters, deliveries and work packages to avoid allocation. Where shared basements, utilities or central facilities serve multiple buildings/uses, record their complete common ledger once, then justify shares by actual physical service, measured GIA, occupancy/capacity or other evidenced use relationships. No universal equal-per-dwelling or area ratio is prescribed. Declare numerator/denominator and unmatched uses; all assigned and unassigned shares reconcile to one, with sensitivity if the relation is uncertain. | rics-wlca-2024; ghg-allocation-2011 |
| allocation_reuse | plywood_formwork; site_utilities | Keep asset identifiers for reused formwork, scaffolding and equipment. Manufacturing burdens use evidenced total lifetime activity/reuses and actual project deployment; transport, repairs, losses and end-of-life remain explicit. Cumulative manufacturing shares across projects, periods and reuse shall not exceed one; an observation period may allocate only its attributable manufacturing share. Unknown lifetime/total activity is a review gap, never a reset to full manufacture per project. | rics-wlca-2024; ghg-allocation-2011 |
| allocation_waste | waste_transfer | Record actual waste transfer, treatment coverage and recovered-product destination separately; do not treat construction scrap as an automatic avoided-production credit. Declare recycling allocation and supplier gate overlap consistently. | ghg-allocation-2011 |

### Calculation Rules

| rule_id | Applies to | Formula or rule | Inputs | Output | source_ids |
| --- | --- | --- | --- | --- | --- |
| project_ledger | all inventory rows | Reconcile actual deliveries, returns, work-package issues, waste transfers and meter records; attribute the documented quantity to this single reference building without dividing by a default dwelling count or area. Preserve internal transfers without double counting.  For permanent/consumed supplied materials and assemblies, apply boundary_consumed_inputs, retaining all attributable failed installation and replacement consumption in actual native units and exact supplied identities. Accepted installation and actual waste stay separate; reusable equipment/formwork manufacture retains allocation_reuse shares rather than the net-stock consumption equation. | cp_groundworks; cp_structure; cp_enclosure; cp_fitout; cp_fixed_systems; cp_common_facilities; cp_site_utilities; cp_waste_transfer; cp_inbound_delivery; cp_handover | row amount per declared reference flow | rics-wlca-2024 |
| equipment_consumption | ceramic_toilet; led_luminaire; heat_pump; water_booster; passenger_lift; ventilation_fan; fire_door; water_tank; steel_duct | Net consumed quantity in each row native unit = gross receipts + opening stock - verified returns/transfers - closing usable stock. Retain item counts for count-based assemblies and measured kg for mass-based pumps, tanks and ducts; do not invent count-to-mass conversion. Include pre-acceptance damage, rejected-and-scrapped units, cutting losses and replacement consumption. Keep accepted installed quantity separate; reconcile consumption to retained installation plus attributable scrap and other evidenced consumption destinations. Waste treatment does not replace manufacturing inputs for scrapped units; no default loss rate. | cp_fixed_systems; cp_common_facilities | individual native-unit supplied input per declared reference flow | jrc-levels-boq-2021 |
| electricity_conversion | lv_electricity; mv_electricity | Multiply actual metered kWh by 3.6 to report MJ; retain the same delivered electricity and voltage gate; separately evidence any transformer losses. | cp_site_utilities | MJ per declared reference flow |  |
| fuel_conversion | site_diesel | Use measured fuel mass and batch net calorific value for MJ; litres require batch/site density at recorded conditions. Actual carbon/oxidation evidence determines the fossil CO2 component independently. | cp_site_utilities | fuel MJ per declared reference flow |  |
| freight_legs | road_freight | For each actual leg multiply documented payload tonnes by travelled km and sum attributable legs. Report allocation/empty returns and exclude legs already in supplier data. | cp_inbound_delivery | t*km per declared reference flow | rics-wlca-2024 |

### Data Quality Requirements

| requirement_id | Applies to | Requirement | Evidence |
| --- | --- | --- | --- |
| quality_completeness | dataset | Reconcile shell/core/external and every private/common work package to delivered scope. Add all actual materials/equipment, route-specific waste and releases absent from these rows. Absence needs documented not-applicable justification; uncollected required quantities are gaps, not zero. | jrc-levels-boq-2021; cp_handover |
| quality_shared | common_facilities | Retain whole-building and parent shared-facility ledgers, capacity/service evidence and area definitions. Do not equate dwelling count, beds, rooms and residents or silently exclude common areas. | rics-wlca-2024; cp_geometry; cp_common_facilities |
| quality_representativeness | all inventory rows | Report construction dates, site, supplier technology/region, measured vs modelled amounts, calibration, unmetered periods, uncertainty and upstream compatibility. Distinguish missing measurements/UUIDs from demonstrated absence. | cp_site_utilities; cp_handover |
| quality_environment | site_utilities; waste_transfer | Direct pollutant estimates require actual source chemistry, medium/submedium, immediate/long-term state and supported engine/soil/weather/treatment conditions. Report noise and water-routing data/characterization gaps; never treat an emission name as proof of occurrence. | epa-construction-dust-2010; epa-concrete-washout-2012 |

## 9. Validation Rules

| rule_id | applies_to | rule | source_ids |
| --- | --- | --- | --- |
| validate_identity | reference_building | Verify the residential/community category and one real whole-building output, signed delivery state, actual count/capacity and all qualifiers. A room or construction service cannot use this reference identity. | un-cpc-3-53112 |
| validate_geometry_shared | dataset | Check measured private/common/service area categories and conventions against as-built plans; reconcile all assigned shared facility/basement burdens and total project quantities. Any supplementary occupant/dwelling attribution must preserve whole-building totals and disclose its actual basis. | rics-wlca-2024 |
| validate_atomic_units | all inventory rows | Check each single physical/chemical exchange, exact public reference property/unit group, conditional applicability, collection protocol and common denominator in both languages. Blank UUID identities remain registered gaps; a near label never authorizes substitution. |  |
| validate_stages | dataset | Verify manufacture linkage, transport and construction coverage separately; no full cradle-to-gate/full-life claim when stages or required quantities are missing. Acceptance evidence does not establish PCR scientific approval or local occupancy permission. | rics-wlca-2024 |
| validate_releases | site_utilities; waste_transfer | Check fossil/bio origin, NO vs NO2/N2O, nonoverlapping particulate fractions, natural intake vs technical water/wastewater and actual receiving medium. Prevent background combustion/treatment duplication and preserve unresolved required environmental data as incomplete coverage. | epa-concrete-washout-2012; epa-construction-dust-2010 |
| validate_asset_shares | plywood_formwork; site_utilities | Verify reused-asset identity, lifetime-activity evidence and cumulative manufacturing shares across projects/periods not exceeding one. Missing denominators require review rather than resetting asset manufacture. | rics-wlca-2024; ghg-allocation-2011 |
| validate_equipment_consumption | ceramic_toilet; led_luminaire; heat_pump; water_booster; passenger_lift; ventilation_fan; fire_door; water_tank; steel_duct | Verify row/model-specific receipts, stocks and returns/transfers under equipment_consumption in each native unit. Reconcile consumed damaged/replacement quantities, accepted installation and waste separately, including permanent common facilities. Exclude verified returned rejects and usable carryover from consumption; final installed counts or masses cannot substitute for input consumption. Reusable temporary manufacture follows allocation_reuse rather than this consumption equation. | jrc-levels-boq-2021 |

## 10. Published Dataset Profile

| Field | Value |
| --- | --- |
| dataset_role | foreground_dataset |

| excluded_use | Full lifetime/service-year claim; universal kg/building or material recipe; legal approval; construction service; private-apartment-only footprint presented as whole building |
| required_metadata | All reference qualifiers; private/common and parent assessment registers; actual structure/route; acceptance scope; stage and upstream gates; actual data/calibration/allocation sources |
| required_quality_disclosure | Measured/modelled scope, missing upstream and quantities, unresolved identities, environmental/characterization gaps, representativeness, shared/reused asset allocation uncertainty and excluded later stages |
| update_trigger | Changes to use/capacity/dwelling configuration, site/geometry, common installations, delivery state, structural route, suppliers, measured records or evidence status |
