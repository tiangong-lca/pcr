# Electrical energy

## 1. Scope and Applicability

This PCR governs foreground data packages whose reference product is electrical energy under CPC 3.0 class 17100. It applies to electricity from a declared single generation technology, a portfolio or grid mix, and electricity delivered through a declared network. The package may end at net plant export or at a declared customer meter, but the selected boundary must be explicit and must remain consistent throughout the inventory.

The PCR is technology-neutral. It covers thermal, nuclear, hydro, wind, solar, ocean, geothermal, electrochemical, and other generation routes, and declared combinations of those routes. It also covers alternating-current or direct-current electricity when the current form is declared. It does not prescribe a universal generation process UUID, emission factor, fuel rate, water rate, or loss rate because those values depend materially on technology, geography, voltage, supplier, and reference period.

Standalone transmission or distribution services, electrical equipment, energy-storage equipment, steam, hot water, and cold water are outside this product category. Electricity stored and subsequently delivered remains in scope only when the electricity output is the reference product and the storage technology, charging-electricity origin, losses, and regulation function are separately disclosed. Use of electricity after the declared customer meter is excluded.

## 3. Reference Flow

| Field | Value |
| --- | --- |
| What | Electrical energy at the declared net-generation or metered-delivery boundary |
| How much | 1 kWh, equivalent to 3.6 MJ |
| How well | Net and metered; current form, voltage, generation technology or mix, geography or grid, delivery boundary, loss treatment, and contractual attributes are declared |
| How long or cycle | A representative reference period, normally one complete year; shorter periods require evidence of representativeness and disclosure of seasonal limitations |
| reference_flow_link | reference_electricity |

| Reference amount | 1 |
| Reference product flow | Electricity `890a70b7-b677-4e2a-8a1b-7d017e0a10ae` |
| Reference flow property | Net calorific value `93a60a56-a3c8-11da-a746-0800200c9a66` |
| Reference unit group | Units of energy `93a60a57-a3c8-11da-a746-0800200c9a66` |

| Required qualifiers | generation technology or mix; geography or grid or supplier; alternating or direct current; voltage at the reference boundary; net plant export or customer-meter boundary; reference period; transmission and distribution loss treatment and accounting location; infrastructure inclusion; annual amount source class; contractual or tracking-instrument treatment |

When constructing a foreground data package, every item listed in `Required qualifiers` shall be declared in dataset metadata, process notes, reference flow comments, product description, or an equivalent data-package field. Missing required qualifiers make the reference flow incomplete for that package.

The generic Electricity flow identifies the product category; it does not by itself establish a voltage-, current-form-, geography-, year-, or boundary-specific interface. Before using an existing interface Flow, verify its physical meaning, flow property, unit chain, and qualifiers. Keep the exact Process and Model versions chosen for an application in that data package and its calculation evidence, rather than fixing dataset versions in this PCR.

## 4. Measurement and Unit Rules

| rule_id | Applies to | Required property | Required unit | Rule |
| --- | --- | --- | --- | --- |
| `measure_reference_energy` | Reference product and internal electricity exchanges | Net calorific value `93a60a56-a3c8-11da-a746-0800200c9a66` | kWh or convertible MJ | Report the functional unit as 1 kWh. Retain each linked Process's verified native reference amount and unit, including a 1 MJ or 3.6 MJ reference when applicable; convert consistently using 1 kWh = 3.6 MJ for comparison and preserve unrounded amounts until final normalization. |
| `measure_net_generation` | Generation output | Net calorific value `93a60a56-a3c8-11da-a746-0800200c9a66` | kWh | Net generation equals gross generator output minus measured plant own-use attributable to electricity production over the same period. Do not mix gross and net quantities. |
| `measure_delivered_energy` | Customer-meter reference boundary | Net calorific value `93a60a56-a3c8-11da-a746-0800200c9a66` | kWh | Prefer reconciled measured delivery at the declared boundary. Network input, delivered output, own use, imports, exports, and losses shall share the same period and network scope; a proxy shall identify its mismatch with that boundary. The 1 kWh reference output is not an observed annual delivered amount. |
| `measure_mix_weighting` | Multi-source generation or supplier/grid mix | Net calorific value `93a60a56-a3c8-11da-a746-0800200c9a66` | kWh | Prefer measured net generated or delivered kWh on the declared basis. If unavailable, derive compatible generation or delivery amounts from documented activity and technology-specific assumptions, and label the result a scenario estimate rather than an observed mix. Installed capacity shares alone and assumed annual-volume surrogates are not actual generation shares. Shares shall sum to 100% after documented rounding and shall not double-count contractual attributes. |
| `measure_annual_supply` | Annual supply or production metadata | Energy in the selected reference Flow's unit | Compatible energy unit in the annual field | Record a numeric annual amount and compatible unit separately from the 1 kWh functional unit. Prefer actual annual production or supply for the declared technology, geography, period, and meter boundary. If no suitable actual amount is obtainable, record a fixed, reproducible assumed annual amount, or explicitly use the native reference Flow amount as an annual surrogate. State the source class, derivation, limitations, and replacement condition in methodology fields; a surrogate is neither observed annual output nor evidence of market share or lifetime asset service. An all-voltage total is not a measured amount at one voltage. |

## 5. System Boundary

### Boundary Abstraction

| Field | Value |
| --- | --- |
| declared_starting_condition | Energy carriers, natural-energy capture, auxiliary materials, purchased electricity, water, and infrastructure products entering the declared electricity system |
| starting_condition_role | Category-variable technosphere inputs represented by reviewed upstream datasets and foreground quantities; no single universal carrier is implied |
| product_classification_scope | CPC 3.0 17100 electrical energy at net generation or declared metered delivery |
| recursive_input_rule | Purchased electricity used inside generation or networks is an input electricity dataset with its own declared mix and boundary; it is not silently replaced by the output dataset being constructed |
| upstream_dataset_requirement | Use reviewed and temporally, geographically, and technologically representative datasets for fuels, materials, water supply, purchased electricity, transport, waste treatment, and infrastructure |
| disclosure | Declare generation technologies and shares, geography, voltage, reference period, net or delivered boundary, loss treatment, infrastructure scope, co-products, and tracking instruments |

| rule_id | Applies to | Rule | source_ids |
| --- | --- | --- | --- |
| `boundary_upstream_supply` | Upstream supply | Include extraction or capture, processing, and transport of energy carriers; production of auxiliary materials and purchased electricity; water supply; and treatment services used by the foreground system. Link these burdens through representative upstream datasets. | `epd-pcr-2007-08-v5-0-2` |
| `boundary_generation_core` | Electricity generation | Include plant operation, fuel or natural-energy conversion, plant own use, auxiliary consumption, maintenance, direct emissions, operational waste, and the life-cycle share of generation infrastructure. | `epd-pcr-2007-08-v5-0-2` |
| `boundary_delivery_conditional` | Transmission and distribution | When the reference product is delivered beyond net plant export, include electricity required to compensate for transmission and distribution losses, network operation and maintenance, direct releases, and the life-cycle share of grid infrastructure up to the declared meter. | `epd-pcr-2007-08-v5-0-2` |
| `boundary_use_exclusion` | Downstream use | Exclude the consumer's use of electricity and all processes after the declared customer meter. Do not exclude losses or grid stages that occur before that meter. | `epd-pcr-2007-08-v5-0-2` |
| `boundary_cutoff_control` | All included stages | Do not use a cut-off rule to omit a known hazardous, regulated, or potentially material flow. Any screened omission shall be quantified where practicable and disclosed with its expected significance; the retained model shall demonstrate at least 99% coverage of relevant mass, energy, and environmental significance when applying the source PCR's 1% screening rule. | `epd-pcr-2007-08-v5-0-2` |
| `boundary_interface_hierarchy` | Production and delivered electricity | Distinguish technology-category production mixes, the regional total production mix, and consumption mixes at each applicable voltage. Follow the actual injection and delivery route, including direct injection, trade and storage where relevant. A production mix and a consumption mix are different products even when their energy unit matches. Count a parent mix or its constituent suppliers at one demand, never both. |  |
| `boundary_explicit_foreground` | Generation, fuel, assets and delivery | Make fuel origin, processing and transport, generation and own-use, technology-defining assets and their construction, maintenance and retirement, mix composition, physical trade, storage and applicable pre-delivery network stages inspectable in the foreground Model or a resolvable linked submodel. Reuse suitable existing processes or justified proxies; generic material and service production may remain in the background behind explicit, quantified inputs. Missing primary data do not remove a required stage, and a solvable background connection alone does not establish a suitable provider or complete foreground coverage. |  |
| `boundary_voltage_data_fallback` | Delivered electricity with missing segment records | Prefer compatible measured losses and assets for each voltage segment. Only if segment losses cannot be obtained but a defensible route-wide loss or proxy exists, assign that total or the residual after known segments once to a declared aggregate interface; other unassigned interfaces may pass equal energy. Disclose the denominator, covered route, asset scope and uncertainty. This is an accounting assumption, not measured zero loss or a universal 1:1 Model multiplier. Without a defensible segment or aggregate value, delivery coverage remains unresolved. |  |

### Evidence and missing-data paths

The intended dataset uses compatible, period-specific records for the declared technology, geography, injection voltage, network segment, generation mix, fuel route, and asset life cycle. Preserve original measurements, their gross/net basis, meter positions, source period, publication edition, and exact provider selection before normalizing to the reference flow. For each material quantity, use this evidence order: suitable direct observation; a reproducible derivation from compatible observations; a calibrated representative proxy; then a fixed, reasoned expert assumption. Record the original value, conversion, scope mismatch, uncertainty, sensitivity when a choice could change the main conclusion, and what evidence would replace the assumption. An unavailable value is never silently set to zero.

For network losses, prefer measured input, output, own use and losses at each applicable voltage segment on a common period and network boundary; allocate segment-specific assets to those segments. Only when voltage-specific losses are unavailable but a defensible total loss or aggregate proxy covers the declared delivery route may the application assign that total, or the residual after known segments, once to a stated aggregate accounting interface. Interfaces without a separate loss assignment may then transfer equal physical energy (1:1) for this scenario. Identify the total-loss denominator, coverage, chosen interface, included assets, remaining segments and uncertainty. Equal-energy transfer is not evidence of physically zero loss at those voltages, is not a universal grid topology, and does not prescribe a Model multiplier of one when native supplier reference amounts differ. Replace the aggregate allocation when suitable segment data become available; never charge the same loss or asset twice. If neither segment data nor a defensible aggregate loss/proxy is available, leave delivery coverage unresolved and do not claim a complete delivered-electricity result.

When an indispensable fuel, asset, waste-treatment or provider quantity lacks a suitable observation or defensible proxy, retain the unresolved demand and identify the affected life-cycle stage and use limitation. A narrower draft may be described with its actual boundary; it does not satisfy the full boundary in this PCR merely because its schema or solver checks pass.

## 6. Process Inventory Structure

### Process Map

| process_id | process_name | inclusion | inclusion_condition | role | quantitative_reference |
| --- | --- | --- | --- | --- | --- |
| `upstream_supply` | Upstream supply of energy carriers, auxiliaries, water, and services | required | Always included; the applicable input set depends on the declared generation technology or mix | Supply reviewed upstream product and service datasets to the foreground electricity system | Quantities normalized to 1 kWh at the declared reference boundary |
| `electricity_generation` | Electricity generation and plant operation | required | Always included; each applicable technology may be instantiated separately and composed into mutually exclusive nested mixes | Convert declared energy resources into net electricity and record plant operation, infrastructure, emissions, wastes, and co-products | Measured net electricity over the reference period, normalized to the reference flow |
| `transmission_distribution` | Transmission and distribution to the declared meter | conditional | Include when the reference boundary is downstream of net plant export; instantiate applicable voltage interfaces | Reconcile network inputs, delivered output, losses, network operation, and grid infrastructure | 1 kWh delivered at the declared voltage and meter |
| `reference_interface` | Declared reference interface | required | Reporting view of the actual net plant-export or customer-meter root; do not create a free electricity provider | Pass through exactly one selected root output without adding burden or supply | 1 kWh at the declared reference boundary |

These rows describe responsibilities, not a fixed number of physical processes. A model may nest multiple mutually exclusive production levels. For a disclosed China 2023 application, one valid statistical tree has a regional total supplied by thermal, hydro, nuclear, wind and solar electricity; thermal may contain coal, gas, biomass and other thermal generation, while solar may contain photovoltaic and solar-thermal submixes. Biomass inside thermal is not also an independent top-level supply. A result Process of a submix may supply its parent only once. The actual injection voltage and direct-supply routes determine the consumption-side graph; this example does not require every generator to pass through high voltage.

If that scenario has a defensible aggregate loss for its declared delivery route but no voltage-specific loss records, it may assign the total once at a declared high-voltage accounting interface and transfer equal energy through unassigned medium- and low-voltage interfaces. This does not establish physical zero loss at those voltages or a universal grid topology. Replace the aggregate allocation with compatible segment records when available.

Each inventory `Normalization basis` states the final amount per declared reference flow. The original period and lifetime denominators remain in the Amount rules and collection methods; the reference interface reports the actual selected root output without adding another supply or double-counting its electricity.

| `allocation_physical_then_economic` | Residual multi-output burden | If allocation cannot be avoided, apply a causal physical relationship. Use economic allocation only when a physical relationship cannot reasonably represent burden causality, and disclose prices, reference period, currency, and sensitivity. | `eu-pef-2021-2279`; `epd-pcr-2007-08-v5-0-2` |
| `allocation_chp_alternative_generation` | Combined heat and power | For useful electricity and heat, allocate the shared burden by the Alternative Generation Method: electricity share = (E_net / eta_e) / [(E_net / eta_e) + (H_net / eta_h)]. Use net measured outputs and documented reference efficiencies; assign exclusive equipment 100% to the product it serves and apply the formula only to shared equipment and burdens. | `epd-pcr-2007-08-v5-0-2` |
| `allocation_waste_and_coproduct_identity` | Residues and recovered outputs | Classify each output once. A useful product with a documented function and destination is a co-product; a flow sent for waste treatment is waste. Do not credit an avoided product unless system expansion is explicitly permitted and documented. | `epd-pcr-2007-08-v5-0-2` |

### Calculation Rules

| rule_id | Applies to | Formula or rule | Inputs | Output | source_ids |
| --- | --- | --- | --- | --- | --- |
| `calc_net_generation` | `electricity_generation` | Net electricity = gross generator output - plant own-use attributable to electricity. Reconcile imports and exports separately and use aligned meter periods. | gross output; attributable plant own use; imports; exports | net electricity output | `epd-pcr-2007-08-v5-0-2` |
| `calc_delivery_balance` | `transmission_distribution` | Accounted network loss = network input + imports - exports - delivered electricity - network own use - storage increase + storage decrease. Scale generation and upstream burdens to the network input needed for 1 kWh delivered. | network input; imports; exports; delivered electricity; own use; storage change | loss and required input per delivered kWh | `epd-pcr-2007-08-v5-0-2` |
| `calc_inventory_normalization` | All foreground inventory rows | Normalized amount = reconciled period amount / reference-period net or delivered electricity, then multiplied by 1 kWh. Keep calculation precision and round only reported values. | reconciled flow amount; reference-period electricity output | flow amount per reference kWh | `epd-pcr-2007-08-v5-0-2` |
| `calc_native_reference_scaling` | Linked foreground Processes and Models | For a supplier with native reference output r, an exchange amount a and demand d in compatible units, its contribution is a*d/r. Retain r, d and the selected supplier; a 1 MJ supplier serving 2 MJ demand scales by 2, while a 3.6 MJ supplier serving 2 MJ scales by 2/3.6. A Model multiplier is not a mix share or an annual production amount. | supplier exchange a; native output r; demand d | contribution per declared reference flow |  |
| `calc_voltage_losses` | Voltage-stage delivery | With measured segment data, calculate each stage on its recorded denominator: if l = loss/input, required input = output/(1-l); if r_loss = loss/output, required input = output*(1+r_loss). If only a defensible aggregate loss exists, assign it once to one stated interface and allow equal-energy transfer at other unassigned stages; this does not mean physical zero loss. If no defensible loss exists, leave coverage unresolved. | segment or aggregate loss; denominator; output; assigned stage | required input at each declared interface |  |
| `calc_mix_residual` | Statistical production mixes | Preserve each published category amount g_i, published total T and original residual T - sum(g_i). Only with compatible reporting scopes, positive sum(g_i), and a documented, justified reconciliation assumption may a bounded residual be allocated proportionally: adjusted g_i = g_i + (T - sum(g_i))*g_i/sum(g_i). This scenario does not identify the residual's actual technology. Preserve original and adjusted values separately; an unexplained or material missing supply remains unresolved rather than becoming a fictitious producer. | original category amounts; total; residual; declared reconciliation rule | traceable scenario weights and unresolved balance |  |
| `calc_combustion_emissions` | Fuel combustion direct releases | For each fuel and GHG, emission = fuel consumption on a net-calorific-value energy basis x representative emission factor. Prefer facility measurements and technology-specific factors; retain fuel, NCV, factor, oxidation or control assumptions, and units. | fuel quantity; net calorific value; emission factor; measurement or control parameters | emission by substance | `ipcc-2006-stationary-combustion` |
| `calc_generation_mix` | Multi-source electricity | Mix inventory = sum of each constituent inventory x its compatible kWh share. Prefer observed net-generation or delivered quantities; when these are unavailable use an explicitly modelled, reproducible scenario estimate with its activity, utilization and time basis, never bare capacity shares or annual-volume surrogates as actual market weights. Shares use the same basis and period and sum to 100% after documented rounding. | constituent inventories; compatible constituent kWh; total kWh | declared observed or estimated electricity-mix inventory | `eu-pef-2021-2279`; `epd-pcr-2007-08-v5-0-2` |
| `calc_chp_allocation` | Combined heat and power | Electricity allocation share = (E_net / eta_e) / [(E_net / eta_e) + (H_net / eta_h)]. Apply the complementary share to useful heat; allocate exclusive assets directly. | net electricity; net useful heat; reference electrical efficiency; reference thermal efficiency | burden shares for electricity and useful heat | `epd-pcr-2007-08-v5-0-2` |
| `calc_infrastructure_amortization` | Generation and network infrastructure | Per-kWh infrastructure amount = included asset quantity x allocation share / lifetime net generation or lifetime delivered electricity corresponding to that asset. | asset quantity; included life-cycle share; allocation share; lifetime electricity | infrastructure amount per kWh | `epd-pcr-2007-08-v5-0-2` |

### Data Quality Requirements

| requirement_id | Applies to | Requirement | Evidence |
| --- | --- | --- | --- |
| `dq_temporal` | All foreground data | Use a complete and representative reference period, normally one year. Explain outages, abnormal dispatch, curtailment, seasonal bias, estimated gaps, and any shorter period. | Timestamped raw records, coverage table, operating log, and representativeness rationale |
| `dq_geographical` | Generation mix, fuel supply, and networks | Match the declared plant, supplier, country or sub-national grid, and voltage. For China, prefer a representative sub-national grid mix when the delivery scope is grid electricity. | Facility and meter locations, supplier evidence, grid boundary, and geographic dataset metadata |
| `dq_technological` | Generation and control technology | Match fuel, conversion technology, unit efficiency, pollution controls, storage, infrastructure, and operating mode; do not use a narrow technology process as a universal CPC 17100 default. | Unit configuration, process description, permits, commissioning year, and technology-specific dataset metadata |
| `dq_metering_and_balance` | Electricity and co-product quantities | Use calibrated or legally controlled meters where applicable and demonstrate gross-to-net, network, and co-product balances on aligned boundaries and periods. | Calibration evidence, raw meter exports, reconciliation workbook, and signed exception log |
| `dq_source_traceability` | Secondary datasets, factors, and contractual attributes | Record source, version or date, geography, technology, licence or access, selection rationale, and any modification. Supplier-specific electricity claims require qualifying contractual or tracking evidence and prevention of double counting. | Dataset metadata, factor sheets, contracts or instruments, quality-criteria assessment, and residual-mix check |
| `dq_completeness` | Inventory boundary | Include all known material, energy, emission, waste, infrastructure, and delivery stages required by section 5. Quantify and justify omissions and explain zero values; an unresolved material stage remains incomplete even if another proxy or a solver returns a number. | Completeness checklist, mass and energy balances, permit comparison, and omission log |
| `dq_evidence_hierarchy` | Material quantities and provider choices | Prefer compatible observations, then reproducible derivations, calibrated proxies and fixed, reasoned assumptions. Keep source facts, estimates and unknowns separate. Disclose source year versus represented year, scope mismatch, uncertainty, material sensitivity and replacement evidence; an available Flow or potential provider alone does not prove that the selected provider is suitable or actually used. | Original record, derivation, provider selection and calculation readback, limitation and sensitivity register |

## 9. Validation Rules

| rule_id | Applies to | Rule | source_ids |
| --- | --- | --- | --- |
| `validate_reference_identity` | Reference flow | Confirm that the actual selected existing electricity interface Flow, property, unit group and unit conversion match the declared technology, voltage, current form and reference boundary. Section 3's generic Electricity Flow identifies the category, not every qualified interface. Confirm all required qualifiers and the CPC 17100 boundary. | `un-cpc-3-0`; `tiangong-identity-query` |
| `validate_energy_balance` | Generation and delivery | Confirm gross minus attributable plant own-use equals net generation, and confirm the delivery balance closes within documented meter uncertainty. Reject mixed periods, voltage scopes, or gross/net bases. | `epd-pcr-2007-08-v5-0-2` |
| `validate_mix_and_attributes` | Electricity mix | Confirm constituent kWh shares sum to 100%, each constituent has compatible boundaries and periods, and contractual attributes are not counted in both supplier-specific and residual/grid mixes. | `eu-pef-2021-2279`; `ghg-protocol-scope-2` |
| `validate_inventory_completeness` | System boundary and inventory | Reconcile fuel and auxiliary records, direct releases, wastes, plant infrastructure, and conditional network stages against permits, meters, asset records, and the completeness statement. | `epd-pcr-2007-08-v5-0-2`; `iea-energy-statistics-manual` |
| `validate_allocation` | Multi-output processes | Confirm the allocation hierarchy is followed, all inputs and outputs are conserved, CHP formula inputs are documented, exclusive equipment is assigned directly, and sensitivity is disclosed for consequential choices. | `eu-pef-2021-2279`; `epd-pcr-2007-08-v5-0-2` |
| `validate_sources_and_period` | Evidence package | Confirm every secondary dataset and factor is identifiable and representative, the foreground reference period is complete, estimates and data gaps are visible, and confidential records remain auditable. | `iea-energy-statistics-manual`; `ghg-protocol-scope-2` |
| `validate_annual_supply` | Annual quantity metadata | Require a numeric annual amount and compatible unit. Prefer a matching actual amount; otherwise verify the fixed assumption or native-reference surrogate and its separate methodology disclosure. Do not interpret a surrogate as measured production, actual market share, or asset lifetime service. |  |
| `validate_voltage_fallback` | Delivered-electricity loss and asset coverage | Use segment-specific evidence when available. Otherwise verify that a defensible aggregate loss/proxy was assigned once, known segments were excluded from the residual, equal-energy transfer is labelled an assumption, and asset scope and uncertainty are disclosed. Reject 1:1 as proof of zero loss or full delivery coverage when no defensible total exists. |  |
| `validate_mix_residual` | Production mix and statistical balance | Check mutually exclusive parent/child categories, original total versus category sum, the evidence for any residual reconciliation, and recomputation of dependent mixes and resulting inventories. Do not create a supplier for an unexplained statistical difference. |  |
| `validate_foreground_lineage` | Model and resulting-process chain | Trace each declared low- or other-voltage demand through exact selected supplier versions, Model/result associations, reference-output exchanges and native r/d scaling. Check effective providers and unresolved demands separately from available candidates, and prevent double counting a parent mix with its children. A valid graph or solver receipt alone does not prove complete life-cycle coverage. |  |
