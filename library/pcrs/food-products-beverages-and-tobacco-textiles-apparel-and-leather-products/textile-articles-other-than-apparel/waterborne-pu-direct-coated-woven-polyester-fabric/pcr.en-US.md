# Waterborne PU direct-coated woven polyester fabric

## 1. Scope and Applicability

This manufacturing profile covers dry roll fabric with a woven continuous-filament PET substrate and one directly applied, unpigmented, non-foamed aqueous aliphatic polyester-PU coating, made from a purchased ready-formulated dispersion, optionally diluted with process water, electrically dried and cooled. The starting fabric is coating-ready, with its previous wet processing completed. Representative product: a declared grade of coated roll fabric for subsequent bag manufacture; this is a production reference, not a guarantee of waterproofness, safety or service life.

The official CPC 3.0 note lists27997 without a detailed process explanation. Classification context does not establish applicability. Solvent-based PU, wet coagulation/DMF, reactive two-component coating, added crosslinker, pigmented or foamed formulations, PVC plastisol, rubber, hot-melt or membrane lamination, coated felt/nonwovens, synthetic leather, tyre cord, medical articles, garments and made-up tents are outside this profile. Fibre manufacture, PET polymerisation, weaving, upstream dyeing/finishing, consumption and end-of-life are separate stages. A materially different route requires reviewed extension, not a claim of whole 27997 coverage. Sources: `unsd-cpc3-notes-2025`; `jrc-textiles-bref-2023`; `covestro-dln-w50`.

PALTEX’s dated 2020 manufacturer article independently describes water-based PU coatings on woven polyester. It supports a historical market example only: the article does not establish this profile’s single-layer formulation, electric dryer, present supplier recipe or numeric performance. Those conditions require actual foreground records. Source: `paltex-pu-woven-2020`.

| --- | --- |
| What | Supply coated woven PET roll fabric for specified downstream conversion |
| How much | 1 kg accepted net finished composite fabric |
| How well | Declared PET construction and finish, PU formulation and dry add-on, width, areal mass, thickness, moisture and batch acceptance criteria; measure actual grade performance |
| How long or cycle | One manufacturing reporting period; no use lifetime or functional equivalence assumed |

| Reference amount | 1 |
| Reference product flow | Waterborne PU direct-coated woven polyester fabric |
| Reference flow property | Mass `93a60a56-a3c8-11da-a746-0800200b9a66` |

Qualifiers must be declared in dataset metadata or equivalent records. Net reference mass includes the PET substrate and adhered dry coating at the declared moisture state, excludes packaging and rejected output, and is not the mass of coating alone.

## 4. Measurement and Unit Rules

| rule_id | Applies to | Required property | Required unit | Rule |
| --- | --- | --- | --- | --- |
| reference_mass | reference product | Mass `93a60a56-a3c8-11da-a746-0800200b9a66` | kg | Weigh accepted finished composite rolls on calibrated scales under cp_output, subtract measured core/wrap tare and use the same conditioning state for output and inventory denominator. |
| area_mass | ready_woven_pet; finished_coated_fabric | Mass | kg | If raw records use m2 or linear metres, measure same-grade areal mass and width; convert area multiplied by kg/m2. Preserve any verified public Area property rather than rewriting it to Mass; generic waterproof fabric is not proof of this product identity. |
| wet_dry | aqueous_pu_dispersion; dilution_water; drying_water_vapour; pu_rinse_wastewater | Mass | kg | Distinguish wet dispersion mass, dry nonvolatile coating mass, retained water, released vapour and wastewater. Measure solids/moisture; no catalogue solids fraction is a universal conversion. |

Assign disjoint meter coverage. |

## 5. System Boundary

### Boundary Abstraction

| Field | Value |
| --- | --- |
| declared_starting_condition | Dry coating-ready woven PET, completed prior dyeing/finishing; delivered ready-formulated aqueous PUD; externally supplied process water |
| starting_condition_role | Upstream supplier handover to coating foreground |
| product_classification_scope | Narrow candidate subset of CPC 3.0:27997; classification title does not cover all routes |
| recursive_input_rule | For bought already PU-coated fabric, record its actual product state and linked upstream coating dataset; do not treat it as uncoated PET or recursively recreate its coating. Recoating is outside this single-coating profile. |
| upstream_dataset_requirement | Link compatible fabric, PUD, electricity, water and each packaging component datasets separately; disclose fibre/polymer, weaving, dyeing/finishing and chemical supply gaps and actual inbound transport coverage |
| disclosure | Factory/period; supplied substrate processing state; composition; electric-only drying; rinse treatment handover; utilities and upstream/transport links; missing stages |

| rule_id | applies_to | rule | source_ids |
| --- | --- | --- | --- |
| boundary_foreground | all processes | Include receipt/mixing, knife application, electric drying/cooling, trim/inspection/winding, actual packing, batch cleaning, attributable start-up/rework and measured outgoing wastes/releases. Internal wet-coated transfers are not additional market outputs. | jrc-textiles-bref-2023 |
| boundary_wet | equipment_clean | Stop at untreated wastewater handover to a documented external treatment recipient. Treatment and its elementary discharges require a linked treatment dataset. Direct discharge or on-site treatment is not represented; cleaning is mandatory data coverage even if a batch has no rinse event. |  |
| boundary_routes | product applicability | Separate previous fabric wet finishing, agricultural feedstock and fibre/polymer manufacture from coating. Other formulation chemicals, heat carriers, maintenance inputs or wastewater-treatment routes require distinct atomic rows and reviewed scope extension before complete-site claims. | covestro-dln-w50 |
| boundary_claim | dataset | This is manufacturing foreground, not automatically complete cradle-to-gate. Require all disclosed compatible upstream and transport links for an expanded footprint. Distribution, bag sewing, use, cleaning by consumers and end-of-life are excluded. |  |

## 6. Process Inventory Structure

### Process Map

| process_id | process_name | inclusion | inclusion_condition | role | quantitative_reference |
| --- | --- | --- | --- | --- | --- |
| receipt_mix | Substrate receipt and dispersion preparation | required | All products in this profile | Manufacturing foreground | per 1 kg reference flow |
| coat_dry | Direct knife coating, electric drying and cooling | required | All products in this profile | Manufacturing foreground | per 1 kg reference flow |
| finish_pack | Final inspection, trimming, winding and packing | required | All products in this profile | Manufacturing foreground | per 1 kg reference flow |
| equipment_clean | Batch-attributed equipment rinse and effluent handover | required | All products in this profile | Manufacturing foreground | per 1 kg reference flow |

Conditional exchanges are described on their individual cards; absence requires actual route records, not an assumed zero. Supplier formulation is one delivered product exchange; separately purchased additives need separate rows. Internal coating/wet-fabric transfers and recovered returns are reconciled without duplicate boundary exchanges. Only accepted final fabric is the quantitative reference. All ordinary mass rows use Units of mass 93a60a57-a4c8-11da-a746-0800200c9a66.

## 7. Allocation and Co-product Handling

| rule_id | applies_to | rule | source_ids |
| --- | --- | --- | --- |
| allocation_trace | shared line | Avoid allocation by batch separation and submetering. For inseparable utility totals, use measured load and logged runtime with actual cleaning campaign attribution; preserve the causal relation and test sensitivity. Do not allocate by equal kg intensity across grades with different coating add-on or drying burden. |  |
| allocation_coproduct | downgraded cloth; exported scrap | Determine waste versus saleable co-product using actual quality, recipient and market records. Prefer subdivision; if joint burdens remain, justify a measured physical causal driver, otherwise document period-specific economic shares and sensitivity. No default price or displaced-fabric credit is prescribed. |  |
| allocation_rework | internal return and rework | Retain all rework/mixing/drying utilities and losses, carry internal returns through stock balance and count accepted fabric once. Record exported waste treatment separately; no burden-free recovered dispersion assumption. |  |

### Calculation Rules

| rule_id | Applies to | Formula or rule | Inputs | Output | source_ids |
| --- | --- | --- | --- | --- | --- |
| normalize_batch | all inventory rows | Divide attributable batch exchange by accepted net finished coated-fabric mass in kg; retain each exchange numerator unit. The final product row is 1 kg. | attributable batch exchange; accepted net mass; cp_output | exchange per 1 kg reference flow |  |
| convert_electricity | mix_electricity; dry_electricity; finish_electricity; clean_electricity | Convert measured kWh to MJ with 3.6 MJ/kWh before batch normalization; preserve public Net calorific value and energy unit group. | metered kWh; cp_mix_energy; cp_dry_energy; cp_finish_energy; cp_clean_energy; cp_output | MJ per 1 kg reference flow |  |

### Data Quality Requirements

| requirement_id | Applies to | Requirement | Evidence |
| --- | --- | --- | --- |
| dq_composition | ready_woven_pet; aqueous_pu_dispersion; finished_coated_fabric | Verify PET composition and previous finishing state, PU grade, additives, wet/dry composition, dry coating add-on and physical batch acceptance. Supplier film tests or marketing are not finished-fabric quality/lifetime evidence. | supplier specifications; SDS; batch solids and fabric tests |
| dq_balance | all rows | Reconcile substrate and nonvolatile PU with accepted composite, offcuts, rejects, residue and stock/rework; separately reconcile coating water with retained moisture, rinse/stock and vapour. Investigate unclosed balances, not assumed yield/loss. | weighing; solids/moisture; separate material/water balances and uncertainty |
| dq_period | all rows | Use matched complete representative reporting-period production, cleaning, maintenance, start-up and rework coverage. Record calibration, missing fields, allocation and all actual ancillary material components. No default temperature, energy, recipe or yield. | period logs; calibration; attributable meter and stock records |
| dq_release | drying_water_vapour; drying_ammonia_air; pu_rinse_wastewater | Assess formulation-dependent volatiles and capture routes. NH3 is conditional, not all aqueous dispersions emit it. Add each actually relevant species as one row before complete release claims; unknown release, unmeasured residue or recipient treatment gaps remain explicit. | composition audit; representative emission tests; controls; treatment handover evidence |
| dq_upstream | linked background supply | Match PET processing state, recycled fraction, PU formulation, electricity geography/voltage, water supply and package composition. Disclose any absent upstream dyeing, water treatment or transport link. | supplier records and compatible upstream dataset references |

## 9. Validation Rules

| rule_id | applies_to | rule | source_ids |
| --- | --- | --- | --- |
| validate_scope | product and route | Require declared PET/PUD profile, electric dryer and untreated rinse handover; reject claims for other coating chemistries, wet coagulation, lamination or complete 27997 coverage. | unsd-cpc3-notes-2025 |
| validate_reference | all rows | Require positive measured net composite output, finished_coated_fabric reference link, exclusion of packaging and a common per 1 kg denominator. Area-based raw measurements require actual same-grade mass conversion. |  |
| validate_balances | all processes | Require material, water and energy reconciliation with disjoint meters, internal return, rework, stock change and conditional stream evidence. Measured wastewater is not freshwater release; captured condensate is not air emission. |  |
| validate_identity | UUID-bearing rows | Recheck actual flow type, composition, supply route, public reference property, unit group, immediate environmental medium/subcompartment and official Chinese names. Disclose blank identities and never force generic waterproof fabric or neat resin onto the output/PUD input. |  |
| validate_complete | dataset claim | Require every real chemical, utility, package, waste and elementary species as a specific exchange with matched protocol. Absent conditional rows need evidence; uncertain or skipped release checks cannot be described as complete validation. | jrc-textiles-bref-2023 |

## 10. Published Dataset Profile

| excluded_use | Whole classification, other fibres/chemistries/lamination, synthetic leather, made-up bags, consumer use/lifetime, health or regulatory approval, automatically complete cradle-to-gate |
| required_metadata | All qualifiers; factory and period; net accepted output; measured area conversion; wet/dry coating basis; separate utilities; stock/rework; packaging; actual effluent recipient; upstream and transport links; conditional presence; unresolved identity |
| required_quality_disclosure | Measurement and allocation coverage; water/material closure and uncertainty; volatile-species screening and detection limits; excluded routes; incomplete upstream/treatment links; candidate evidence limits |
| update_trigger | Substrate finish/fibre, recycled profile, coating composition/layer, added chemicals, heat route, site supply, packaging, waste fate, emission controls, new measurements or verified identity change |
