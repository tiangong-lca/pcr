# Own-account wholesale of factory-packed folded wool-knit jumpers

## 1. Scope and Applicability

This PCR covers own-account merchant wholesale of factory-finished folded and packed knitted wool-containing jumpers/pullovers, including actual declared blends, through ordinary ambient receiving, stock/pack-condition records, electric handling and actual business-buyer acceptance. Actual style/size/piece count, fibre composition and its basis/source, whole-garment net mass including integral trims, pack tare, moisture method/sample/basis and visible or supplier-evidenced condition define each case. Wool naming does not imply 100% wool.

Exclude greasy-wool/scouring/topmaking/yarn/knitting/garment manufacture and finishing, laundering, steam/ironing, repair/redye, garment chemical/pest treatment, supplier primary opening/repacking, hanging/reforming as a processing route, and dedicated temperature/humidity intervention without review. Also exclude other apparel/fur/retail/agency and standalone storage/transport. Household cleaning, vacuum bags, silica, cedar, mothballs and home inspection schedules are not required operations. Non-invasive records or representative traceable supplier measurements may support quantities/condition; no compulsory destructive opening/sampling is introduced.

Every actual garment/blend-fibre and inherited-pack production stage, including embodied upstream of lost material, belongs to a separate factory-finished/packed commodity system. Compatible assigned original-gate demand and actual loss adjustment with sole owner/existing coverage are mandatory outside this service before full-chain use. Merchant resources, real rejected-goods handling and receiver treatment remain once.

## 4. Measurement and Unit Rules

| rule_id | Applies to | Required property | Required unit | Rule |
| --- | --- | --- | --- | --- |
| commercial_count | accepted_service | Count | Item(s) | N is final unique accepted commercial consignment, not individual jumper, carton, invoice or wool kg. |
| garment_pack_basis | commodity audit | Mass; Count | kg; Item(s) | Whole net garment includes actual integral trims/internal labels; inherited external pack/insert/support tare separate. Garment count is physical qualifier, no standard per-piece mass. |
| fibre_moisture_basis | analytical audit | declared native property | declared native unit | Actual blend fraction basis/source and moisture component/method/sample/time/state explicit. A dry-fibre label fraction does not apply blindly to whole as-received garment incl trims. Only representative compatible component/whole measurements may support conversions; no 100% wool or standard regain. |
| supply_receiver_native | actual new supplies/outlets | native property | native unit | Actual packing unit/per-piece mass or measured Mass/Volume with density-temperature/conversion source required. |
| physical_equivalence | providers/assets | Count | Item(s) | Match actual completed physical package or complete whole-asset equivalent/native unit with full coverage; other actual native units need appropriate expansion. |
| freight_native | freight | mass*distance | kg*km | Use actual complete as-transported garment+packing/support mass times km and real disjoint share, not wool-fibre mass. |
| species_native | direct_species | Mass | kg | Actual species/medium/particle identity and measured or justified matched activity/factor/composition/fate; captured fibres or chemical product purchase do not prove release. |


## 5. System Boundary

### Boundary Abstraction

| Field | Value |
| --- | --- |
| declared_starting_condition | Factory-finished folded/packed knitted wool-containing jumper release, actual style/size/composition/trim/pack and condition traceable |
| starting_condition_role | Merchant physical own-account ambient wholesale add-on after complete garment factory release |
| product_classification_scope | Narrower apparel wholesale subset; actual finished garment commodity system independent |
| recursive_input_rule | Do not consume/respin raw wool, re-knit garments or recursively manufacture traded apparel inside service. Merchandise stock/demand is non-exchange audit; actual service supplies/providers separately scoped. |
| upstream_dataset_requirement | Separate original factory-finished/packed garment system covers all actual wool/blend-fibre production and applicable post-shear scouring/topmaking/spinning/knitting/assembly/finishing/fold/packing stages once. Greasy-wool farmgate dataset alone omits downstream manufacture; add every missing actual stage outside service with compatible assigned demand/loss coverage. |
| disclosure | Actual style/size/SKU/blend basis/source, count/net garment incl trims, pack tare/moisture method/sample/time/state and condition; manufacturer/merchant/buyer periods; source-gate assigned quantity/unit/state/source/allocation/conversion/loss-owner/existing coverage; physical resources/providers/full-life assets/carriers/receivers |

| rule_id | Applies to | Rule | source_ids |
| --- | --- | --- | --- |
| finished_garment_boundary | all traded garments | Exclude all garment/blend manufacture/finishing/inherited packing and lost upstream; separate linked baseline reaches actual factory release, not greasy wool or yarn alone. |  |
| fold_condition_context | actual product/pack records | Record factory folded pack, visible/supplier-evidenced shape/moisture/insect/mould condition and buyer criteria. Woolmark consumer care gives qualitative folded/moisture/insect context only; no household washing, vacuum bag, silica, cedar, mothball or frequency becomes wholesale instruction/input/emission. | woolmark-wool-storage-context |
| no_unreviewed_treatment | whole route | No garment washing/steam/ironing/repair/redye/product-contact pest treatment, opening/repacking or dedicated climate intervention, including actual contracted processing. Such acts require fresh scope/module review; no hidden intervention under hygiene package. |  |
| periods_and_attempts | stock/actual events | Retain actual source/lot/style/size/consignment/event/period and opening/receipts/dispatch/returns/reject/closing/internal moves. Failed/unfinished resources carry even when only final unique buyer acceptance creates N. Condition score or observation alone is not physical destruction or loss. |  |
| physical_owners | all resources/outlets | Direct utilities/supplies/provider/carrier/full-life asset/receiver treatment have one actual owner. No finance/margin, automatic household care or avoided-production credit substitutes physical evidence. |  |


## 6. Process Inventory Structure

### Process Map

| process_id | process_name | inclusion | inclusion_condition | role | quantitative_reference |
| --- | --- | --- | --- | --- | --- |
| `ambient_wholesale` | Factory-packed folded-jumper merchant stock handling and handover | required | Actual manufacturer-released folded/packed wool-containing knitted jumpers under merchant ownership through ordinary ambient stock/handling and actual B2B acceptance | One physical merchant service with garment/style/size/composition/state/pack/period responsibility, no manufacturing/preservation node | `accepted_service` |

The true node owns receiving/check/holding/electric handling and actual warehouse-surface hygiene. Garment/inherited pack quantities and condition are a non-exchange commodity ledger; conditional actual supplies/providers/assets/receiver/species expand from records. Shape damage, suspect insects/mould, usable returns, retained rejects, actual discard and direct release remain distinct states.

### Process: Factory-packed folded-jumper merchant stock handling and handover (`ambient_wholesale`)

#### Inputs

##### Product flows

###### Actual alternating-current electricity at point of use (`electricity_ac`)

Only actual alternating-current electricity crossing this node boundary and not already inside a complete provider. The identity leaves provider, voltage, generation mix and delivery-loss allocation unspecified; collect them where required. Its ILCD reference property is named Net calorific value but the verified electricity flow defines an electrical-energy basis of 1 MJ; native kWh uses exactly 3.6 MJ per kWh, never a fuel heating-value factor. Direct-current or another unmatched electricity state stays in the residual requirement.

- Selected flow: Alternating current `455f0ef5-6118-4f2b-a3f5-1f75e0afe3ca`
- Flow property / unit: Energy / kWh
- Amount rule: Actual attributable purchased electricity per reference flow
- Value mode: `foreground_record`
- Specificity: `site_specific`
- Normalization basis: per reference flow
- Basis kind: `reference_flow`
- Evidence kind: `collected_record`
- Collection protocol: `cp_utilities`

Range evidence need: Actual source meters/charging/event scope and all-user causal driver intervals including idle/hygiene/open work needed; no standard energy per jumper, garment manufacturing load or assumed dehumidifier use.

###### Actual liquid treated tap-water supply (`cleaning_water_liquid_tap`)

Applicable only when the actual source is treated tap water supplied for the declared use. Preserve actual supplier, quality, temperature/state and provider boundary; do not assume that every water supply is tap water. Ice, bottled/mineral/reclaimed/untreated water and direct environmental withdrawal stay in their actual separate identities. Keep the parent native mass or volume basis. For any final mass-reference conversion, require actual compatible density/state evidence; the catalogue secondary-volume relationship is not a default site density.

- Selected flow: Tap water `d1e0e36c-07f0-4a75-bdcb-efb5d9e2ac36`
- Flow property / unit: Volume / m3
- Amount rule: Actual attributable purchased cleaning water per reference flow
- Value mode: `foreground_record`
- Specificity: `site_specific`
- Normalization basis: per reference flow
- Basis kind: `reference_flow`
- Evidence kind: `collected_record`
- Collection protocol: `cp_utilities`

Range evidence need: Require real meters/cleaning-event quantities and actual source/treatment scope; no household wool wash procedure, liquid-to-garment ratio or water purchase=effluent equality.

###### Actual independently recorded synthetic detergent supply (`hygiene_supplies_synthetic_detergent`)

Only actual synthetic surfactant detergent identified by product/formulation, supplied state and use records. Measure net supplied material excluding package tare; retain concentrate/dilution-water distinctions and never count whole formulation and components additively. Soap, disinfectants, wipes, filters and other materials remain under their separate actual identities; no cleaning recipe, dose or occurrence is assumed.

- Selected flow: Detergent `1c57d123-df57-49ab-b9d4-957403beb8a5`
- Flow property / unit: Mass / kg
- Amount rule: Actual attributable actual new hygiene supply mass per reference flow
- Value mode: `foreground_record`
- Specificity: `site_specific`
- Normalization basis: per reference flow
- Basis kind: `reference_flow`
- Evidence kind: `collected_record`
- Collection protocol: `cp_supplies`

Range evidence need: Actual SKU/formulation/product mass, stock/unused-return/receiver and composition-fate evidence needed; no home-care supply kit or pest-chemical dose/release assumption.

###### Completed own-account factory-packed folded wool-knit jumper wholesale consignment (`accepted_service`)

One actual unique business-buyer accepted commercial service for factory-finished folded/packed knitted pullovers containing declared wool and any actual blend fibres. Actual style/size/SKU/lot/fibre-composition basis, garment pieces/net mass including integral trims, source/moisture/pack/date/condition and buyer gate qualify the service. Wool naming does not assume 100% wool, and one reference is not one jumper or wool kilogram.

- Selected flow: Completed own-account factory-packed folded wool-knit jumper wholesale consignment
- Flow property / unit: Count / Item(s)
- Amount rule: 1 Item(s)
- Value mode: `foreground_record`
- Specificity: `site_specific`
- Normalization basis: per reference flow
- Basis kind: `reference_flow`
- Evidence kind: `collected_record`
- Collection protocol: `cp_garment`

Range evidence need: Actual commercial acceptance plus matching style/size/fibre label-source/net/tare/moisture/condition evidence required; no standard wool percentage, jumper size/mass, consignment piece count or quality tolerance.

###### Unused synthetic detergent returned to supplier (`unused_mass_returns_detergent_return`)

Only an independently evidenced actual unused synthetic detergent returned to supplier in this process is covered. Record its own physical state, net kg, event/source and handover gate. Other states or receivers require their own identity decision `unused_mass_returns`; this card is not a substitute for them. Do not infer occurrence or zero from missing records. Match the unused material exactly to input `hygiene_supplies_synthetic_detergent` in formulation, supplied state and native mass. It is an external usable return, not waste, closing stock or internal circulation. Include this output only with the gross-supply convention; omit the matched return output entirely when the input has already been netted by that return. No automatic avoided-production credit.

- Selected flow: Detergent `1c57d123-df57-49ab-b9d4-957403beb8a5`
- Flow property / unit: Mass / kg
- Amount rule: Actual exclusively assigned kg for `unused_mass_returns_detergent_return` / accepted N once; preserve an already-per-reference quantity without dividing again.
- Value mode: `foreground_record`
- Specificity: `site_specific`
- Normalization basis: per reference flow
- Basis kind: `reference_flow`
- Evidence kind: `collected_record`
- Collection protocol: `cp_supplies`

Range evidence need: Require event-linked native kg, state/composition, receiver or provider gate, allocation records and exclusion links to all whole/component or matched-input records; use protocol `cp_supplies`. No numeric default or conversion factor is supplied. A different native unit requires evidenced conversion before use.

##### Waste flows

###### Discarded wool knitted jumper (`garment_waste_atomic_case`)

Conditional on independently recorded actual Discarded wool knitted jumper. This card covers only that named physical state, with its own actual net quantity, retained contents and receiver gate. Other parts, fragments, free liquids, separate packing or cleanup carriers remain identity evidence decisions under `garment_waste`; do not shift the boundary, infer an event, use a stock deficit as discard, or count a retained component as another outlet. A genuinely co-collected mixture requires its own exact identity. Use the original native-unit amount protocol only for this exclusively identified case; reconcile every other actual fate separately.

- Selected flow: Discarded wool knitted jumper
- Flow property / unit: Mass / kg
- Amount rule: Actual attributable discarded garment-stream mass per reference flow
- Value mode: `foreground_record`
- Specificity: `site_specific`
- Normalization basis: per reference flow
- Basis kind: `reference_flow`
- Evidence kind: `collected_record`
- Collection protocol: `cp_garment`

Range evidence need: Need actual style/size/composition/state, piece/mass/pack-inclusion evidence and receiver disposition; no condition-score=loss, label fibre percentage=emission, or default landfill/recycling route.

###### Actual separately collected paper packaging waste (`packaging_waste_paper_pack`)

Only actual independently discarded and separately collected paper packaging at this node, with its actual wet/as-collected composition, receiver and treatment/transport responsibility. A contaminated or co-collected mixed stream must use its own verified identity; its material components are non-additive audits. Returnable packaging still in use is not this waste; no composition, quantity, recycling or treatment is assumed.

- Selected flow: Packaging waste, paper `6b6f1025-cb6a-4c9d-9947-7726c4307a76`
- Flow property / unit: Mass / kg
- Amount rule: Actual attributable separately collected packing-waste mass per reference flow

Range evidence need: Real component/net quantities/condition/remaining contents/receiver needed; no default retail bag weight or every pack removed on receipt, no automatic recycled-material substitution.


###### Actual separately collected metal packaging waste (`packaging_waste_metal_pack`)

Only actual independently discarded and separately collected metal packaging at this node, with its actual wet/as-collected composition, receiver and treatment/transport responsibility. A contaminated or co-collected mixed stream must use its own verified identity; its material components are non-additive audits. Returnable packaging still in use is not this waste; no composition, quantity, recycling or treatment is assumed.

- Selected flow: packaging waste (metal) `cdda6013-c0c5-4c72-990a-f5668fe71069`
- Flow property / unit: Mass / kg
- Amount rule: Actual attributable separately collected packing-waste mass per reference flow

- Collection protocol: `cp_outlets`

Range evidence need: Real component/net quantities/condition/remaining contents/receiver needed; no default retail bag weight or every pack removed on receipt, no automatic recycled-material substitution.


###### Actual separately collected plastic packaging waste (`packaging_waste_plastic_pack`)

Only actual independently discarded, separately collected empty plastic packaging with its actual composition, moisture and receiver. Retained merchandise, contaminated mixed packs, foam inside appliances, disposable wipes and composite packaging do not use this case. Components retained in a whole mixed stream are non-additive audits; retain actual transport/treatment ownership once. No emptying, recycling, occurrence or quantity is assumed.

- Selected flow: packaging waste (plastic) `919351c4-3e25-4092-9934-73ecec021a3b`
- Flow property / unit: Mass / kg
- Amount rule: Actual attributable separately collected packing-waste mass per reference flow

- Collection protocol: `cp_outlets`

Range evidence need: Real component/net quantities/condition/remaining contents/receiver needed; no default retail bag weight or every pack removed on receipt, no automatic recycled-material substitution.

###### Discarded premises-cleaning wipe with retained contamination (`hygiene_waste_spent_wipe`)

Only an independently evidenced actual discarded premises-cleaning wipe with retained contamination in this process is covered. Record its own physical state, net kg, event/source and handover gate. Other states or receivers require their own identity decision `hygiene_waste`; this card is not a substitute for them. Do not infer occurrence or zero from missing records. Activate only for an actual independently collected transfer to a waste receiver, not for a component retained in a whole article, pack or mixed collected stream. Keep retained constituents as non-additive composition records. No opening, cutting, dismantling, deliberate drying, recovery yield or treatment route is prescribed. Treatment/transport coverage has one owner. Identify the actual wipe substrate and retained contamination at the receiver. A filter, loose absorbent or independently collected liquid is not this wipe. The spent whole mass includes retained contamination once; dry supplied wipe mass is only a component audit.

- Selected flow: Discarded premises-cleaning wipe with retained contamination
- Flow property / unit: Mass / kg
- Amount rule: Actual exclusively assigned kg for `hygiene_waste_spent_wipe` / accepted N once; preserve an already-per-reference quantity without dividing again.
- Value mode: `foreground_record`
- Specificity: `site_specific`
- Normalization basis: per reference flow
- Basis kind: `reference_flow`
- Evidence kind: `collected_record`
- Collection protocol: `cp_outlets`

Range evidence need: Require event-linked native kg, state/composition, receiver or provider gate, allocation records and exclusion links to all whole/component or matched-input records; use protocol `cp_outlets`. No numeric default or conversion factor is supplied. A different native unit requires evidenced conversion before use.

###### Collected aqueous premises-cleaning wastewater sent to treatment (`wastewater_aqueous_cleaning`)

Only an independently evidenced actual collected aqueous premises-cleaning wastewater sent to treatment in this process is covered. Record its own physical state, net m3, event/source and handover gate. Other states or receivers require their own identity decision `wastewater`; this card is not a substitute for them. Do not infer occurrence or zero from missing records. Activate only for an actual independently collected transfer to a waste receiver, not for a component retained in a whole article, pack or mixed collected stream. Keep retained constituents as non-additive composition records. No opening, cutting, dismantling, deliberate drying, recovery yield or treatment route is prescribed. Treatment/transport coverage has one owner. This is the aqueous premises-cleaning stream, with its actual dissolved/suspended load and measured received volume. Exclude separately collected undiluted merchandise, organic fluid, condensate or sanitary wastewater. If these actually mix before one transfer, identify that real mixture separately; do not sum constituent volumes or label it pure cleaning water. No quantity is inferred from supplied water.

- Selected flow: Collected aqueous premises-cleaning wastewater sent to treatment
- Flow property / unit: Volume / m3
- Amount rule: Actual exclusively assigned m3 for `wastewater_aqueous_cleaning` / accepted N once; preserve an already-per-reference quantity without dividing again.
- Value mode: `foreground_record`
- Specificity: `site_specific`
- Normalization basis: per reference flow
- Basis kind: `reference_flow`
- Evidence kind: `collected_record`
- Collection protocol: `cp_outlets`

Range evidence need: Require event-linked native m3, state/composition, receiver or provider gate, allocation records and exclusion links to all whole/component or matched-input records; use protocol `cp_outlets`.

## 7. Allocation and Co-product Handling

| rule_id | Applies to | Rule | source_ids |
| --- | --- | --- | --- |
| original_gate_assignment | garment merchandise | Assign actual complete factory-finished/packed source input to accepted cohort in compatible native state/unit/composition/moisture basis with source/allocation/conversion. Include evidenced original material and ordinary moisture/state-change share without treating it as fibre loss; returns/closing/other exits exclusive. Final dispatched garment mass plus waste is not automatically original-gate demand. Actual compatible loss adjustment and existing coverage owned once outside service; unknown mass/count differences unresolved, not default loss or zero. |  |
| all_user_attribution | actual service periods | Use real all-consumer source periods and causal handling/occupied-space-time or other justified native driver, with units/source/rationale, including idle/hygiene/failed/open attempts. Equal consignments, garment count or wool mass splits are not presumed. Unfinished work retains attribution without fictitious N. |  |
| supply_return_convention | new direct supplies | S=opening_supply+net_receipts-closing_supply. Gross input S/N with separately recorded actual matched native unused outward-return output OR consumed-only (S-usable_outward_return)/N with matching return exchange omitted and no extra deduction. Require same-scope standalone stock pairing; retained recovery is closing, inherited garment/asset contents do not reduce unrelated current supply. |  |
| complete_asset_life | shared_assets | asset_equivalent=(job_driver/life_driver)/N for one compatible complete asset and every user/period. Manufacture/maintenance/real replacements/retirement/end-of-life, observed history+sourced remainder and uncertainty/sensitivity/update explicit. Direct/provider/carrier overlaps removed only after same burden has one owner elsewhere; no per-turn new bin/pallet or duplicate rent/service+asset view. |  |
| actual_transfer_states | real returns/wastes | Usable commercial returns/retained rejects remain commodity states. Actual discarded garment stream includes only associated pack actually transferred together; separately removed pack/mixed hygiene/liquid streams are exclusive. Components/moisture/fibre analyses are nonadditive, no duplicate physical or species output. Receiver/treatment scope once, no default recycling/substitution benefit. |  |

Verify net whole garment including actual integral trims/internal labels after measured external packing/support tare, via non-invasive or representative traceable supplier measurements without mandated opening. Moisture/component sampling state/method/time/basis/representativeness and composition basis explicit; no blanket dry-wool conversion. Record actual visible/supplier condition, real returns/retained rejects/discards and compatible stock/unit differences. Trace original complete-garment source demand and actual compatible loss outside service once, exclusive other exits and existing coverage. Attribute only the individually identified physical case; retain other source-linked actual fates separately.

| garment_component_audit | non-exchange garment | net_garment_mass=gross_quantity-primary_pack_tare-external_label_insert_tare-outer_pack_tare-pallet_support_tare, keeping actual integral trims/internal labels in garment net mass. Component dry mass, if genuinely needed and representatively measured, uses actual component_mass and compatible component moisture_fraction: component_dry_mass=component_mass*(1-moisture_fraction) for wet basis OR component_mass/(1+moisture_fraction) for dry basis. Apply actual component_fibre_fraction only on matching declared fraction_basis; do not multiply whole as-received trimmed garment by label wool percentage. Analytical views nonadditive. | cp_garment | Actual whole garment/tare/component/composition/moisture audit, no new manufacturing exchange |  |
| finished_gate_demand | non-exchange commodity | assigned_source_gate_quantity=actual compatible evidenced source_gate_input_quantity allocation/conversion to accepted cohort, including evidenced assigned_moisture_state_change_share, excluding exclusive returns/closing/other exits. commodity_source_gate_demand=assigned_source_gate_quantity/N outside service.

### Data Quality Requirements

| requirement_id | Applies to | Requirement | Evidence |
| --- | --- | --- | --- |
| finished_style_state | received/accepted jumpers | Actual factory finish/fold/pack style/size/lot composition source and care/buyer condition criteria required, with real garment count/net/tare and non-invasive or representative supplier records; no pure-wool/default home care. | cp_garment factory/SKU/label/buyer state and record evidence |
| composition_moisture_loss | garment stock/actual fates | Whole garment incl trims differs textile/fibre/component analysis; actual moisture basis/method/sample/time/representativeness and compatible fraction basis. Shape/moth/mould/weight differences are not automatic disposal/loss/species. Finished-gate actual demand/loss owner/state/unit/source/coverage outside once. | Actual quantity/condition/stock/fate and separately quantified original-gate commodity link |
| physical_completeness | all resources and periods | Actual all-user native drivers/provider scope, full asset lifecycle/history/remainder/uncertainty and source/carrier/treatment owners including idle/hygiene/failed/open events once. | Source meter/supply/provider/asset/transport/receiver records |
| concrete_identity_ranges | actual expanded rows | Resolve actual SKU/package/asset/waste/species and native property/unit support before final data; quantitative ranges need comparable independent evidence, no invented benchmark. | Actual detail/support/receiver and empirical range applicability evidence |

| requirement_id | applies_to | requirement | evidence |
| --- | --- | --- | --- |
| electricity | ambient_wholesale | Which supply point, AC/DC state, voltage and supplier dataset cover the meter record? Reconcile the listed AC row with any evidenced other supply; do not use the AC UUID for a different carrier. Measure real electric handling/charging, lighting, record/inspection and ordinary ventilation or surface-cleaning equipment. This ambient route has no onsite combustion or dedicated temperature/humidity intervention, garment steam/ironing/laundering/drying. An actual additional physical operation requires scope/module review. Range evidence need: Actual source meters/charging/event scope and all-user causal driver intervals including idle/hygiene/open work needed; no standard energy per jumper, garment manufacturing load or assumed dehumidifier use. Measurement evidence: protocol `cp_utilities`; original record basis Energy / kWh. The original amount constraint “Actual attributable purchased electricity per reference flow” applies separately only to identity/unit-compatible individual rows; it creates no category-total exchange and does not assign the original unit to a different material or service. Do not normalize an already-per-reference quantity again. Defined flow cards: `electricity_ac`. Other actual states require the specific evidence decision above before any identity is assigned. This evidence record is not an exchange and cannot produce a category-total quantity. | `cp_utilities`; actual source-linked native records |
| cleaning_water | ambient_wholesale | Does the supplier record establish treated tap water, or a different named water quality/source? Identify the supply state and gate; do not replace a non-tap-water supply with the tap-water card. Actual external utility water for warehouse floors/equipment only, with source/treatment and provider boundaries. No garment wash/rinse/steam or inferred water uptake from textile moisture. Record actual cleanup receiver/recirculation/make-up independently. Range evidence need: Require real meters/cleaning-event quantities and actual source/treatment scope; no household wool wash procedure, liquid-to-garment ratio or water purchase=effluent equality. Measurement evidence: protocol `cp_utilities`; original record basis Volume / m3. The original amount constraint “Actual attributable purchased cleaning water per reference flow” applies separately only to identity/unit-compatible individual rows; it creates no category-total exchange and does not assign the original unit to a different material or service. Do not normalize an already-per-reference quantity again. Defined flow cards: `cleaning_water_liquid_tap`. Other actual states require the specific evidence decision above before any identity is assigned. This evidence record is not an exchange and cannot produce a category-total quantity. | `cp_utilities`; actual source-linked native records |
| hygiene_supplies | ambient_wholesale | Obtain the purchased SKU, formulation/SDS, supplied concentration, physical state, purpose and stock/issue records for the named cleaning or maintenance duty in this record. Identify the actual non-detergent material individually; do not prescribe a chemical, filter substrate or dose from this PCR. Actual named surface-cleaning agents, wipes or other mass-measured service consumables expanded by SKU/state/unit. No mothballs, cedar, silica sachets, repellents or chemical treatment of garments is prescribed. Actual non-product-contact pest monitoring/sanitation, if contracted, has explicit provider resource boundaries; garment treatment requires separate route review. Range evidence need: Actual SKU/formulation/product mass, stock/unused-return/receiver and composition-fate evidence needed; no home-care supply kit or pest-chemical dose/release assumption. Measurement evidence: protocol `cp_supplies`; original record basis Mass / kg. The original amount constraint “Actual attributable actual new hygiene supply mass per reference flow” applies separately only to identity/unit-compatible individual rows; it creates no category-total exchange and does not assign the original unit to a different material or service. Do not normalize an already-per-reference quantity again. Defined flow cards: `hygiene_supplies_synthetic_detergent`. Other actual states require the specific evidence decision above before any identity is assigned. This evidence record is not an exchange and cannot produce a category-total quantity. | `cp_supplies`; actual source-linked native records |
| added_packing | ambient_wholesale | Obtain the package bill/specification, material or laminate identity and actual added-versus-inherited ownership. Determine each missing sleeve, seal, label, strap or support identity from that record; an integral composite is not several additive material exchanges. Actual merchant-added outer transport cases/straps/protective units only, with defined material/unit and actual per-piece mass if converted. Factory primary pack/fold/seal/labels/hangers or inserts remain inherited merchandise audit; do not unpack/repack garments here. Reusable bins/pallets belong to assets. Range evidence need: Require actual added unit/material/native stock and return records; no default household storage bag, vacuum packing, cedar or desiccant, standard pieces per carton or new primary bag per jumper. Measurement evidence: protocol `cp_supplies`; original record basis Count / Item(s). The original amount constraint “Actual attributable new outer transit units per reference flow” applies separately only to identity/unit-compatible individual rows; it creates no category-total exchange and does not assign the original unit to a different material or service. Do not normalize an already-per-reference quantity again. This evidence record is not an exchange and cannot produce a category-total quantity. | `cp_supplies`; actual source-linked native records |
| provider_packages | ambient_wholesale | Obtain the provider contract/completed-result record for each named duty in this record, with native billed physical unit and included resources. Identify the individual service result; inspection, cleaning and handling are different services, and price/hours cannot be relabelled as Item(s). Actual complete provider-defined physical package for agreed pack/state verification, warehouse sanitation, non-product-contact pest monitoring, handling or maintenance, with equivalent native unit and full resource coverage. Do not substitute margin/fee/invoice for resources. Outsourced laundering/steam/repair/redye/product treatment/repacking remains an excluded physical process requiring reviewed extension. Range evidence need: Actual contract completion, native unit/equivalence and energy/material/asset/treatment inclusion/exclusion required; no standard inspection frequency, household care routine or price-based resource-free Count. Measurement evidence: protocol `cp_provider`; original record basis Count / Item(s). The original amount constraint “Actual attributable equivalent completed packages per reference flow” applies separately only to identity/unit-compatible individual rows; it creates no category-total exchange and does not assign the original unit to a different material or service. Do not normalize an already-per-reference quantity again. This evidence record is not an exchange and cannot produce a category-total quantity. | `cp_provider`; actual source-linked native records |
| shared_assets | ambient_wholesale | For each explicitly named asset in this record, obtain the asset register identifier, configuration and matching complete-lifecycle dataset. The missing decision is the individual asset/service identity and lifetime all-user denominator; a warehouse, forklift and pallet cannot share one Count exchange or inherit a default life. Real warehouse/racks/electric handlers/reusable bins/pallets/monitoring/scales represented by a matching complete whole-asset equivalent. Manufacturing, maintenance, actual replacements, retirement/end-of-life cover all users and periods. Do not manufacture one new reusable carrier on each turn or duplicate provider rent and whole assets. Range evidence need: Need identity/lifecycle scope, compatible native all-user job/life drivers, observed history and sourced remainder with uncertainty/sensitivity; no universal storage-rack lifetime or pallet/bin rotation count. Measurement evidence: protocol `cp_assets`; original record basis Count / Item(s). The original amount constraint “Actual attributable whole-asset equivalents per reference flow” applies separately only to identity/unit-compatible individual rows; it creates no category-total exchange and does not assign the original unit to a different material or service. Do not normalize an already-per-reference quantity again. This evidence record is not an exchange and cannot produce a category-total quantity. | `cp_assets`; actual source-linked native records |
| freight | ambient_wholesale | For each actual inbound, outbound, return and waste leg, obtain mode/vehicle, temperature service, origin/destination, actual load and distance plus provider coverage. The missing mode/configuration prevents selection of one freight identity; never collapse unlike modes into one kg*km flow. Actual agreed inbound/outbound/return work for complete as-transported garments including integral trims plus inherited/added packing and transported supports. Declared wool percentage or dry fibre analysis is not payload mass. Carrier embedded energy/vehicle assets and empty/multi-drop/returns coverage need one owner. Range evidence need: Actual gross/net load components, route distance and mutually exclusive share/native conversion sources required; no standard jumper mass, cartons per pallet, wool fraction to shipment or default road distance. Measurement evidence: protocol `cp_freight`; original record basis mass*distance / kg*km. The original amount constraint “Actual attributable complete-load freight work per reference flow” applies separately only to identity/unit-compatible individual rows; it creates no category-total exchange and does not assign the original unit to a different material or service. Do not normalize an already-per-reference quantity again. This evidence record is not an exchange and cannot produce a category-total quantity. | `cp_freight`; actual source-linked native records |
| unused_count_returns | ambient_wholesale | Match the external return ticket to exactly one input SKU, state and native unit, and identify the receiver. Under consumed-only input accounting omit its matched return exchange; merchandise returns and closing inventory are separate audit records. Only real unused additional Count packing returned externally, paired with original same-scope supplystock/unit and receiver acceptance. Internal movement and retained stock are not outputs. Select gross input plus this return OR consumed-only input with matching return exchange omitted; no double deduction. Range evidence need: Require actual pair IDs/units/count/receiver and selected stock view; no assumed unused fraction, manufacturer pack credit or avoided-production benefit. Measurement evidence: protocol `cp_supplies`; original record basis Count / Item(s). The original amount constraint “Actual attributable unused packing units returned per reference flow” applies separately only to identity/unit-compatible individual rows; it creates no category-total exchange and does not assign the original unit to a different material or service. Do not normalize an already-per-reference quantity again. This evidence record is not an exchange and cannot produce a category-total quantity. | `cp_supplies`; actual source-linked native records |
| unused_mass_returns | ambient_wholesale | Match the external return ticket to exactly one input SKU, state and native unit, and identify the receiver. Under consumed-only input accounting omit its matched return exchange; merchandise returns and closing inventory are separate audit records. Real unused mass-measured service product returned externally with exact state/net quantity and original same-scope standalone supply pairing. Garment commercial returns are separate commodity movements, not negative service or unused consumables. Spent wipes/agents remain waste. Range evidence need: Actual product/state/original-scope/return pairing and calibrated net mass needed; no credit against unrelated current supply or factory-inherited goods/assets. Measurement evidence: protocol `cp_supplies`; original record basis Mass / kg. The original amount constraint “Actual attributable unused hygiene supply returned mass per reference flow” applies separately only to identity/unit-compatible individual rows; it creates no category-total exchange and does not assign the original unit to a different material or service. Do not normalize an already-per-reference quantity again. Defined flow cards: `unused_mass_returns_detergent_return`. Other actual states require the specific evidence decision above before any identity is assigned. This evidence record is not an exchange and cannot produce a category-total quantity. | `cp_supplies`; actual source-linked native records |
| garment_waste | ambient_wholesale | Obtain the independent transfer ticket for the actual outlet described in this record, including parent item/SKU, physical state, retained composition, receiver and treatment scope. Match it to one listed physical case; an unmatched part, fluid or contaminated mixture needs its own named identity, not this record ID as a waste flow. Actual rejected garments transferred to a waste receiver, with real garment mass including integral trims and any associated pack only if physically transferred in that same measured stream. Shape distortion, insects/mould observation or return alone does not prove discard or mass loss. Do not duplicate associated packaging under a separate physical output. Commodity upstream loss remains separately linked outside service; actual handling/treatment once. Range evidence need: Need actual style/size/composition/state, piece/mass/pack-inclusion evidence and receiver disposition; no condition-score=loss, label fibre percentage=emission, or default landfill/recycling route. Measurement evidence: protocol `cp_garment`; original record basis Mass / kg. The original amount constraint “Actual attributable discarded garment-stream mass per reference flow” applies separately only to identity/unit-compatible individual rows; it creates no category-total exchange and does not assign the original unit to a different material or service. Do not normalize an already-per-reference quantity again. Defined flow cards: `garment_waste_atomic_case`. Other actual states require the specific evidence decision above before any identity is assigned.

| packaging_waste | ambient_wholesale | Obtain the independent transfer ticket for the actual outlet described in this record, including parent item/SKU, physical state, retained composition, receiver and treatment scope. Match it to one listed physical case; an unmatched part, fluid or contaminated mixture needs its own named identity, not this record ID as a waste flow. Only actual already-separated/damaged packing from real incidents or outer handling, with material/state/remaining garment inclusion and receiver records. No routine primary opening/rebagging or new retail-pack manufacture. Exclude packaging already transferred with discarded garments or mixed cleanup waste. Range evidence need: Real component/net quantities/condition/remaining contents/receiver needed; no default retail bag weight or every pack removed on receipt, no automatic recycled-material substitution. Measurement evidence: protocol `cp_outlets`; original record basis Mass / kg. The original amount constraint “Actual attributable separately collected packing-waste mass per reference flow” applies separately only to identity/unit-compatible individual rows; it creates no category-total exchange and does not assign the original unit to a different material or service. Do not normalize an already-per-reference quantity again. Defined flow cards: `packaging_waste_paper_pack`; `packaging_waste_metal_pack`; `packaging_waste_plastic_pack`.

| hygiene_waste | ambient_wholesale | Obtain the independent transfer ticket for the actual outlet described in this record, including parent item/SKU, physical state, retained composition, receiver and treatment scope. Match it to one listed physical case; an unmatched part, fluid or contaminated mixture needs its own named identity, not this record ID as a waste flow. Real used surface-cleaning wipes/absorbers/monitoring consumables or captured mixed solids, including actual retained fibres/moisture/agents only where measured in the stream state. Clean supply and constituent analysis remain nonadditive views. Captured fibre is not airborne emission; no fabric cutting or garment laundry residue is invented. Range evidence need: Actual net transfer state/composition/retained-liquid/garment-pack exclusions and receiver evidence needed; no clean-supply=spent mass or default moth/mould/fibre-release amount. Measurement evidence: protocol `cp_outlets`; original record basis Mass / kg. The original amount constraint “Actual attributable mixed hygiene-waste mass per reference flow” applies separately only to identity/unit-compatible individual rows; it creates no category-total exchange and does not assign the original unit to a different material or service. Do not normalize an already-per-reference quantity again. Defined flow cards: `hygiene_waste_spent_wipe`. Other actual states require the specific evidence decision above before any identity is assigned. This evidence record is not an exchange and cannot produce a category-total quantity. | `cp_outlets`; actual source-linked native records |
| wastewater | ambient_wholesale | Obtain the independent transfer ticket for the actual outlet described in this record, including parent item/SKU, physical state, retained composition, receiver and treatment scope. Match it to one listed physical case; an unmatched part, fluid or contaminated mixture needs its own named identity, not this record ID as a waste flow. Actual collected surface-cleaning/incident liquid to a receiver with measured volume or compatible mass-density-temperature basis and actual load/source. No garment washing/steam/dry-cleaning water and no effluent inferred from garment moisture. Contained liquid differs from direct species/medium releases. Range evidence need: Actual collection/receiver, conversion density/temperature and treatment/load scope required; no household wash-water ratio, default pollution factor or supply-to-drain fraction. Measurement evidence: protocol `cp_outlets`; original record basis Volume / m3. The original amount constraint “Actual attributable contained cleaning-liquid volume per reference flow” applies separately only to identity/unit-compatible individual rows; it creates no category-total exchange and does not assign the original unit to a different material or service. Do not normalize an already-per-reference quantity again. Defined flow cards: `wastewater_aqueous_cleaning`.

| direct_species | ambient_wholesale | Identify each measured release at its source/event, chemical or particle-size identity, origin and receiving compartment using the emission/sampling record. Unknown species, unresolved particle fraction or unknown medium must remain a specific evidence gap; neither total chemical use nor stock loss supplies that identity. Only actual measured or justified source-matched species and receiving medium, with particle size where relevant. Garment blend labels, moisture changes, moth/mould/odour observations, captured fibres and household pest-care advice do not establish chemical, biological, water-vapour or microfibre releases. Actual whole-stream composition/fate and release evidence are independent. Range evidence need: Need actual identity/medium/particle, quantity/native conversion and factor/composition/fate applicability; no assumed mothball/cedar chemical, synthetic blend% to microplastics or moisture residual to air. Measurement evidence: protocol `cp_environment`; original record basis Mass / kg. The original amount constraint “Actual attributable directly released species mass per reference flow” applies separately only to identity/unit-compatible individual rows; it creates no category-total exchange and does not assign the original unit to a different material or service. Do not normalize an already-per-reference quantity again. This evidence record is not an exchange and cannot produce a category-total quantity. | `cp_environment`; actual source-linked native records |
