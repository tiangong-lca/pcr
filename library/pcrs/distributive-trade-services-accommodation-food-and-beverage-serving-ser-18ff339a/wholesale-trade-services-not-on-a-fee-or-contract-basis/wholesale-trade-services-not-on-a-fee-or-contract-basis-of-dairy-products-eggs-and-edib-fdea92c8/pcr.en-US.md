# Own-account refrigerated wholesale of sealed pasteurized cow milk

## 1. Scope and Applicability

This PCR defines an additive physical wholesale service for manufacturer-released,sealed prepacked pasteurized cow drinking milk bought and resold on own account to business buyers. The wholesaler actually operates monitored refrigerated holding and dispatch; the commercial output is one accepted consignment with actual product/pack/lot/temperature/time qualifiers. Packages remain unopened during normal wholesale handling.

Exclude raw milk,fresh shell eggs,UHT/ambient-stable milk,other milk species,fermented/concentrated/dried dairy,milk manufacture/pasteurization/filling/repacking/reprocessing,retail,commission agency and purely financial transfer. Accidental leaks,reject segregation and actual loss disposal do not authorize a manufacturing/recovery route; intentional opening or reprocessing requires separate reviewed scope. Codex milk guidance supports product-specific cold-chain responsibility and manufacturer storage conditions without supplying a universal temperature or shelf-life/default-loss factor.

| covered_products | Completed actual own-account B2B refrigerated wholesale consignment service for released unopened pasteurized cow milk |
| excluded_products | Raw milk and fresh shell eggs; UHT/ambient milk; other dairy products; manufacturing/filling/reprocessing; retail or fee agency |
| representative_product | One accepted contractual consignment with specified SKU/fat state,pack count,label volume,actual liquid mass and primary seal/lot/thermal conditions |
| production_route | Released chilled packed-product intake -> monitored operated refrigerated storage/stockrotation -> order handling and cold-chain dispatch -> B2Bacceptance; actual returns and loss routes |
| market_state | Accepted distribution service; milk remains sealed processed merchandise at declared handover state,not the service flow itself |


## 3. Reference Flow

| Field | Value |
| --- | --- |
| What | Completed refrigerated own-account sealed pasteurized cow-milk wholesale consignment service |
| How much | 1 Item(s) as one unique completed contractual consignment; no fixed package count,L,kg,tonne or margin conversion |
| How well | Actual manufacturer release,label/storage requirements,primary seal integrity,SKU/fat/lot and accepted time-temperature conditions documented; no PCR-guaranteed microbial or remaining-life outcome |
| How long or cycle | Actual receipt through storage/dispatch/buyer acceptance with relevant idle,defrost,cleanup,reporting cutoff and full-life asset periods |
| reference_flow_link | `accepted_service` |

| Field | Value |
| --- | --- |
| Reference amount | 1 |
| Reference product flow | Completed refrigerated own-account sealed pasteurized cow-milk wholesale consignment service |
| Reference flow property | Number of items `01846770-4cfe-4a25-8ad9-919d8d378345` |
| Reference unit group | Units of items `5beb6eed-33a9-47b8-9ede-1dfe8f679159` |
| Reference unit | Item(s) |
| Required qualifiers | sealed_pasteurized_cow_drinking_milk; manufacturer_release_and_original_gate; SKU_fat_state_and_primary_pack; pack_count_and_label_volume_unit; measured_net_milk_mass_density_temperature; lot_date_and_shelf_life_conditions; intake_storage_transport_acceptance_times; actual_product_and_room_temperature_records; seal_integrity_and_quarantine_disposition; ownership_resale_business_buyer; unique_accepted_consignment; cold_room_carrier_provider_responsibility; additional_packing_and_reusable_crate_scope; reporting_period_and_loss_adjustment_link |

N>0 is the count of unique completed and accepted commercial consignments after actual reversals. Pack counts and net milk quantities describe the service stratum,not an automatic equivalence between different consignments. Quarantine,canceled orders,failed handovers or internal crate moves are not accepted reference outputs; their actual resources are retained in evidenced cohort/cross-period responsibility.

## 4. Measurement and Unit Rules

| rule_id | Applies to | Required property | Required unit | Rule |
| --- | --- | --- | --- | --- |
| ref_count | reference product | Number of items `01846770-4cfe-4a25-8ad9-919d8d378345` | Item(s) | Use the actual unique completed acceptance unit; output amount is 1 Item(s). Actual pack count is a separate merchandise ledger,not N. |
| milk_measurement | merchandise and actual losses | Volume and Mass | L; kg | Label fill volume is not measured liquid mass. Retain actual pack count,gross/tare/net contents,density with temperature/state/unit and source,plus lot-specific conversion and uncertainty. Do not assume1L=1kg or a universal package tare. |
| native_exchange | all inventory | actual native property | actual native unit | Preserve supplier/provider/container nativeunits and verify actual conversion. Already filled primary packaging is merchandise upstream; actual added secondary packing and reusablecrate lifecycle are separate responsibilities. |
| cold_fates | refrigerant and waste/release rows | Mass and actual composition | kg; actual unit | Separate named fluid supply,charge,recovery,contained waste,return and actual component release. Separate whole closedpack versus actual separated milk/pack/water streams; no duplicated total and parts or default residual leakage. |


## 5. System Boundary

The bounded preservation intervention accepts already released chilled sealed milk,operates monitored refrigeration and stock rotation under actual product conditions,and hands over unopened accepted merchandise within its declared cold-chain responsibility. It does not manufacture safer milk or reset shelf life. Actual excursions,seal failures,quarantine,returned lots and cleaning/defrost are traced to the owning lot/period.

### Boundary Abstraction

| Field | Value |
| --- | --- |
| declared_starting_condition | Manufacturer-released pasteurized cow drinking milk already filled/sealed and chilled at a specified commodity gate,SKU/lot and state |
| starting_condition_role | Audited merchandise stock/throughflow including original primary packaging,not a consumed commodity-production exchange in this service |
| product_classification_scope | Refrigerated physical own-account service for sealed prepacked pasteurized cow drinking milk,a subset of CPC61022 |
| recursive_input_rule | An actual upstream distribution/cooling service must have disjoint contract scope and resources; never recurse through the same consignment or repeat carrier refrigeration |
| upstream_dataset_requirement | Compatible actual resource/provider/full-life asset/receiving treatment datasets; separate commodity baseline must match manufacturer-released pasteurized milk already filled/sealed in its actual primary package. A farm raw-milk dataset alone is incomplete: assemble any missing milk processing,pasteurization/filling and primary-packaging scopes exactly once. Match original-gate loss adjustment to that processed packaged state and actual package fate |
| disclosure | All reference qualifiers; source and acceptance gates; positive N; sealedpack stock/lot/density-temperature and losses; actual cold-chain owner; resource/provider/logistics/waste scope and commodity-loss integration |

| rule_id | applies_to | rule | source_ids |
| --- | --- | --- | --- |
| boundary_addon | all inventory | Exclude ALL traded-milk production and original filled primary-pack upstream burdens,including loss-embedded upstream burden,from this service add-on. Require separately quantified original-gate lost-commodity adjustment and saleable-commodity burden exactly once in the linked commodity system before whole-chain completeness; actual service loss handling/treatment remains inside. |  |
| boundary_cold | sealed_milk_distribution | Use actual manufacturer instructions,validated product-specific storage conditions and observed time/temperature/handling records for received and accepted sealed milk. No universal setpoint,shelf life or automatic legal/hygiene compliance claim is supplied by this PCR. | codex-milk-hygiene-2004 |
| boundary_contents | returns and losses | Do not open normal merchandise,record new primary filling or infer disposal from an expired/returned label. Actual return/quarantine/saleable downgrade/discard decisions need traceable receiver/gate; actual accidental separated contents and packing must not also count the same whole rejected pack. |  |
| boundary_owner | all physical responsibilities | Identify one owner for actual own/provider refrigeration,electricity,fuel,transport,asset manufacture/cleaning/maintenance/replacement/EOL and receiving treatment. Expand actual environmental water intake/outfall,chemical/refrigerant wastes and substance releases by real state/medium. Unknown actual scope blocks final data completeness. |  |


## 6. Process Inventory Structure

### Process Map

| process_id | process_name | inclusion | inclusion_condition | role | quantitative_reference |
| --- | --- | --- | --- | --- | --- |
| sealed_milk_distribution | Operated cold preservation and own-account sealed-milk distribution | required | Actual released sealed pasteurized cow-milk ownership-resale and operated monitored refrigerated holding | One preservation responsibility from accepted released/chilled/sealed intake to documented B2Bcold-chain handover; batch mode picking/dispatch/cleaning,continuous shared refrigeration | `accepted_service` |

Do not create manufacturing,packaging or grading nodes merely from receipt inspections and order picking. Capture actual idle,defrost,returns and cleanup events while identifying each provider/resource owner. Conditional roles must be concretely expanded from actual SKU,fluid,substance,unit,receiver and scope evidence; missing actual environmental water or solid/chemical/fluid waste is not silently zero. A provider that entirely owns the actual cold intervention must disclose that complete upstream scope and avoid repeated direct refrigeration resources.

### Process: Operated cold preservation and own-account sealed-milk distribution (`sealed_milk_distribution`)

#### Inputs

##### Product flows

###### Actual alternating-current electricity at point of use (`electricity_ac`)

Only actual alternating-current electricity crossing this node boundary and not already inside a complete provider. The identity leaves provider, voltage, generation mix and delivery-loss allocation unspecified; collect them where required. Its ILCD reference property is named Net calorific value but the verified electricity flow defines an electrical-energy basis of 1 MJ; native kWh uses exactly 3.6 MJ per kWh, never a fuel heating-value factor. Direct-current or another unmatched electricity state stays in the residual requirement.

- Selected flow: Alternating current `455f0ef5-6118-4f2b-a3f5-1f75e0afe3ca`
- Flow property / unit: Energy / kWh
- Amount rule: Attributed measured electricity / N; cp_cold.
- Value mode: `foreground_record`
- Specificity: `site_specific`
- Normalization basis: per reference flow
- Basis kind: `reference_flow`
- Evidence kind: `collected_record`
- Collection protocol: `cp_cold`

Range evidence need: Need actual room/product/ambient conditions,meters,occupancy and idle/defrost/changeover records with physical all-consumer driver; no universal kWh per pack or tonne.

###### Diesel for actually operated on-site milk handling plant (`diesel`)

Conditional actual on-site diesel fuel supply, separate from measured combustion; any transport refrigeration fuel needs an explicitly assigned owner and actual unit.

The fixed identity represents generic supplied diesel on a Mass/kg reference basis; actual grade, formulation, supplier and heating value remain recorded attributes, not presets. Retain the native litre record and actual compatible density with temperature/state, mass-per-volume unit and source for any final kg conversion; the catalogue defines no default density. Missing density leaves final volume-to-mass conversion incomplete, never zero or an assumed value. Supplied diesel is not burned diesel, transport service or a direct emission.

- Selected flow: Diesel fuel `9d258d75-6792-4f1c-9856-81602ed8f816`
- Flow property / unit: Volume / L
- Amount rule: Assigned diesel supplied / N; cp_fuel.
- Value mode: `foreground_record`
- Specificity: `site_specific`
- Normalization basis: per reference flow
- Basis kind: `reference_flow`
- Evidence kind: `collected_record`
- Collection protocol: `cp_fuel`

Range evidence need: Need gross/tare/net receipts and native stocks,burn,returns,wastes and uncontained losses without inferring burn from missing quantity.

###### Actual liquid treated tap-water supply (`cleaning_water_liquid_tap`)

Applicable only when the actual source is treated tap water supplied for the declared use. Preserve actual supplier, quality, temperature/state and provider boundary; do not assume that every water supply is tap water. Ice, bottled/mineral/reclaimed/untreated water and direct environmental withdrawal stay in their actual separate identities. Keep the parent native mass or volume basis. For any final mass-reference conversion, require actual compatible density/state evidence; the catalogue secondary-volume relationship is not a default site density.

- Selected flow: Tap water `d1e0e36c-07f0-4a75-bdcb-efb5d9e2ac36`
- Flow property / unit: Volume / m3
- Amount rule: Actual metered attributable water / N; cp_water.
- Value mode: `foreground_record`
- Specificity: `site_specific`
- Normalization basis: per reference flow
- Basis kind: `reference_flow`
- Evidence kind: `collected_record`
- Collection protocol: `cp_water`

Range evidence need: Need use,outlet and retention evidence,including any milk-contaminated cleanup state; wastewater volume is not pure water or a default milk loss.

###### Actual independently recorded synthetic detergent supply (`cleaning_products_synthetic_detergent`)

Only actual synthetic surfactant detergent identified by product/formulation, supplied state and use records. Measure net supplied material excluding package tare; retain concentrate/dilution-water distinctions and never count whole formulation and components additively. Soap, disinfectants, wipes, filters and other materials remain under their separate actual identities; no cleaning recipe, dose or occurrence is assumed.

- Selected flow: Detergent `1c57d123-df57-49ab-b9d4-957403beb8a5`
- Flow property / unit: Mass / kg
- Amount rule: Attributed preparation supplied / N; cp_supplies.
- Value mode: `foreground_record`
- Specificity: `site_specific`
- Normalization basis: per reference flow
- Basis kind: `reference_flow`
- Evidence kind: `collected_record`
- Collection protocol: `cp_supplies`

Range evidence need: Need native quantity,active/carrier composition,actual dilution and unit/density/temperature source; no amount or emission inferred from a safety label.

###### Actual separately recorded polyethylene packaging film (`secondary_packing_pe_film`)

Only actual independently supplied polyethylene film used as additional service-owned wrapping or lining, verified by actual polymer/formulation and net film mass. This identity is generic production mix at plant; retain actual supply gate, provider and separately owned delivery burdens. It does not prescribe LDPE/HDPE grade, recycled content, film thickness or dose. PVC/PET/PP, multilayer composites, adhesive labels, filled packs and inherited merchandise packaging remain separate residual identities. Whole supply and components must not be counted twice; no occurrence is assumed.

- Selected flow: Polyethylene film `e64eb06c-6dc9-45f1-b003-3dc6c44b27e2`
- Flow property / unit: Mass / kg
- Amount rule: Attributed added packing supply / N; cp_supplies.
- Value mode: `foreground_record`
- Specificity: `site_specific`
- Normalization basis: per reference flow
- Basis kind: `reference_flow`
- Evidence kind: `collected_record`
- Collection protocol: `cp_supplies`

Range evidence need: Need actual native Count/Area/Length/Mass unit,stock and return proof; expand native unit and make any mass view nonadditive, no assumed wrap per order.

###### Paperboard carton supplied for additional shipping protection (`secondary_packing_paperboard_carton`)

Only an independently evidenced actual paperboard carton supplied for additional shipping protection in this process is covered. Record its own physical state, net kg, event/source and handover gate. Other states or receivers require their own identity decision `secondary_packing`; this card is not a substitute for them. Do not infer occurrence or zero from missing records. Use only when the added package is established as a paperboard carton. Record construction, net paperboard-carton mass and provider gate. A plastic crate, wood box or composite carton with a materially different identity needs a separate card; inherited packaging and returnable assets are excluded. No fibre grade, recycled share or mass-per-carton is assumed.

- Selected flow: Paperboard carton supplied for additional shipping protection
- Flow property / unit: Mass / kg
- Amount rule: Actual exclusively assigned kg for `secondary_packing_paperboard_carton` / accepted N once; preserve an already-per-reference quantity without dividing again.
- Value mode: `foreground_record`
- Specificity: `site_specific`
- Normalization basis: per reference flow
- Basis kind: `reference_flow`
- Evidence kind: `collected_record`
- Collection protocol: `cp_supplies`

Range evidence need: Require event-linked native kg, state/composition, receiver or provider gate, allocation records and exclusion links to all whole/component or matched-input records; use protocol `cp_supplies`. No numeric default or conversion factor is supplied. A different native unit requires evidenced conversion before use.

##### Waste flows

###### Discarded sealed pasteurized cow-milk pack (`sealed_rejects_atomic_case`)

Conditional on independently recorded actual Discarded sealed pasteurized cow-milk pack. This card covers only that named physical state, with its own actual net quantity, retained contents and receiver gate. Other parts, fragments, free liquids, separate packing or cleanup carriers remain identity evidence decisions under `sealed_rejects`; do not shift the boundary, infer an event, use a stock deficit as discard, or count a retained component as another outlet. A genuinely co-collected mixture requires its own exact identity. Use the original native-unit amount protocol only for this exclusively identified case; reconcile every other actual fate separately.

###### Actual separately collected paper packaging waste (`packing_waste_paper_pack`)

Only actual independently discarded and separately collected paper packaging at this node, with its actual wet/as-collected composition, receiver and treatment/transport responsibility. A contaminated or co-collected mixed stream must use its own verified identity; its material components are non-additive audits. Returnable packaging still in use is not this waste; no composition, quantity, recycling or treatment is assumed.

- Selected flow: Packaging waste, paper `6b6f1025-cb6a-4c9d-9947-7726c4307a76`

###### Collected aqueous premises-cleaning wastewater sent to treatment (`cleaning_effluent_aqueous_cleaning`)

Only an independently evidenced actual collected aqueous premises-cleaning wastewater sent to treatment in this process is covered. Record its own physical state, net m3, event/source and handover gate. Other states or receivers require their own identity decision `cleaning_effluent`; this card is not a substitute for them. Do not infer occurrence or zero from missing records. Activate only for an actual independently collected transfer to a waste receiver, not for a component retained in a whole article, pack or mixed collected stream. Keep retained constituents as non-additive composition records. No opening, cutting, dismantling, deliberate drying, recovery yield or treatment route is prescribed. Treatment/transport coverage has one owner. This is the aqueous premises-cleaning stream, with its actual dissolved/suspended load and measured received volume. Exclude separately collected undiluted merchandise, organic fluid, condensate or sanitary wastewater. If these actually mix before one transfer, identify that real mixture separately; do not sum constituent volumes or label it pure cleaning water. No quantity is inferred from supplied water.

##### Elementary flows

###### Actual separately evidenced fossil carbon dioxide emitted to air (`other_direct_species_co2_fossil_air`)

Actual records establish fossil origin, carbon dioxide substance and direct air release. Preserve the reported carbon/CO2 basis; any carbon-to-CO2 calculation requires its own supported stoichiometry and no inferred factor or occurrence. This is a direct actual node release, not purchased-electricity/upstream/provider-covered emissions. The UUID denotes air with no finer subcompartment; resolve a different applicable compartment/origin under the residual requirement rather than relabelling it. Missing data is not zero.

- Selected flow: carbon dioxide (fossil) `08a91e70-3ddc-11dd-923d-0050c2490048`

###### Actual separately evidenced fossil methane emitted to air (`other_direct_species_methane_fossil_air`)

Actual records establish fossil origin, methane substance and direct air release. Biogenic or unknown-origin methane stays under the residual actual-species requirement and is never relabelled fossil. No leakage occurrence, gas fraction, quantity or emission factor is inferred. This is a direct actual node release, not purchased-electricity/upstream/provider-covered emissions. The UUID denotes air with no finer subcompartment; resolve a different applicable compartment/origin under the residual requirement rather than relabelling it. Missing data is not zero.

## 7. Allocation and Co-product Handling

| rule_id | applies_to | rule | source_ids |
| --- | --- | --- | --- |
| allocation_count | all inventory | Assign actual failure/quarantine/rejected-order,return-handling,idle/defrost and cleanup resources to their evidenced positive accepted cohort N or disclosed unfinished/cross-period responsibility; do not delete burdens where no accepted output yet exists. No currency/margin allocation as a physical service unit. |  |
| allocation_merchandise | milk stock and loss linkage | Reconcile pack counts,SKU/lot,status and compatible measured liquid/whole-pack quantities across opening,net receipts,buyer returns,closing,sales,supplier returns,quarantine release and discard. Quarantine movements are internal stocks,not a new receipt or accepted output. Quantify original-gate lost milk and associated primary-pack burden using actual unit,density-temperature/conversion basis/source and owner/already-included scope,then link it once outside this service. |  |
| allocation_supply | extra supplies and usable_extra_returns | For each actual native supply,S=attributed opening+external net receipts-closing including recovered closing; net receipts use actual gross/tare where applicable. Choose gross supply INPUT S with a separate matched usable outward-return OUTPUT,OR consumed-only INPUT S-return with the matched return exchange omitted. Do not subtract twice,call closing stock outward return or remove waste/spill upstream burden. |  |
| allocation_assets | shared_assets | Full-life asset equivalents equal cohort compatible use driver / complete lifetime driver across every consuming lot/site/period,then divided by N once. Include manufacture,cleaning/maintenance,replacement and EOL. Use observed lifetime or actual history plus evidenced remainder/termination,compatible driverunits,uncertainty/sensitivity/update. A lifecycle-complete per-driver provider is an alternative view,not another additive asset burden. |  |
| allocation_period | shared refrigeration and providers | Within each compatible meter/operation period allocate measured complete scope by cohort physical driver / all-consumer driver; include idle/defrost/door/cleanup and reconcile total scope across all cohorts. Carry unfinished stocks and replacements between periods once. |  |
| allocation_waste | actual loss and packing paths | Keep actual unopened compound reject,actual leaked milk,cleaning effluent and separated packaging mutually nonduplicative. Merchandise returns are not new service supply returns; no automatic waste/recycling/coproduct/avoided-production credit. Waste treatment boundary must match actual provider,including any transport coverage once. |  |


| rule_id | applies_to | rule | source_ids |
| --- | --- | --- | --- |
| allocation_refrigerant | refrigerant_makeup; usable_refrigerant_return; refrigerant_waste; refrigerant_air | Assign actual initial factory charge and any fluid-production burden already inside complete equipment manufacture/provider dataset to one owner,not an additional repeated fluid input. Recovered fluid retained at closing is stock; actual usable external return is a separate Product outlet only with receiver/state proof; actual nonusable fluid goes to documented recovery/treatment Waste outlet. Apply gross supplied input plus separate matched usable return OR consumed-only input less that return with matched return exchange omitted. Retain nonreturned waste/release upstream burden and actual transport/treatment once; no automatic recycling/substitution credit. Consumed-only subtraction is permitted ONLY for a return matched to the same independently supplied operating-fluid inventory and its upstream burden scope. Recovered usable fluid originating in an initial factory/equipment charge already carried by an asset/provider dataset must NOT reduce unrelated operating make-up supply; record its actual outward Product transfer with no automatic credit and retain the asset-fluid burden owner. Close initial equipment charge,stored fluid,actual external receipts,internal recovery/transfers,final charge and retained stocks physically; recovery is an internal movement,not a new external receipt. Unknown/mixed origin requires evidenced provenance/apportionment before any supply subtraction,never a negative unrelated make-up input. |  |



| rule_id | applies_to | rule | source_ids |
| --- | --- | --- | --- |
| source_scope_normalization | nonexchange commodity and service combination | Keep original external commodity stock, source assignment/loss and missing-stage/additional upstream integration quantities in their evidenced RAW actual scope. Identify whether each amount is one actual consignment, a target service cohort, or ALREADY per reference,with source/target scope IDs and quantity basis. The physical source-cohort all-exit denominator assigns RAW quantity to that target scope; it is not automatically the target accepted-service N. Only when combining that same target-scope commodity amount with the 1 Item(s) service derive amount per reference = RAW assigned amount / positive unique accepted source_same_scope_N,with acceptance IDs/time/reversal evidence. A proved single-case scope has source_same_scope_N=1; an already-per-reference amount is not divided again. Preserve raw integration quantities and source links; do not shrink actual upstream remediation or divide the whole source cohort by an unrelated N. N0 responsibility remains disclosed without division. |  |

A proved single-case scope has source_same_scope_N=1; an already-per-reference amount is not divided again. Preserve raw integration quantities and source links; do not shrink actual upstream remediation or divide the whole source cohort by an unrelated N.

### Calculation Rules

| rule_id | Applies to | Formula or rule | Inputs | Output | source_ids |
| --- | --- | --- | --- | --- | --- |
| normalize_consignment | all inventory rows | Divide attributed physical exchange quantity by positive N once; accepted_service is 1 Item(s),not pack count or milk volume. | attributed quantity; N; linked collection protocol | exchange quantity per reference flow |  |
| period_driver | electricity; provider_jobs; freight; electricity_ac | For each compatible period multiply measured complete scope by cohort driver/all-consumer driver,then sum nonoverlapping periods and apply normalize_consignment. | period quantity; cohort driver; all-consumer driver; compatible units; scope ownership | attributed physical quantity |  |
| asset_driver | shared_assets | Use cohort compatible lifetime-use driver divided by complete lifetime driver as asset equivalents; apply normalize_consignment once. Never add equivalent complete per-driver provider scope for the same asset. | full asset lifecycle; cohort driver; lifetime driver and units; history; evidenced remainder; termination; cp_assets | attributed complete asset equivalents |  |
| stock_supply | diesel; cleaning_products; secondary_packing; usable_extra_returns; cleaning_products_synthetic_detergent; secondary_packing_pe_film | S=attributed opening+external net receipts-closing including recovered closing. Gross INPUT S and separate matched unused return OUTPUT OR consumed-only INPUT S-return omitting that return exchange. Actual fuel burn,waste and uncontained loss remain distinct fates. | opening; gross and tare receipts; net receipts; closing; matched usable return; representation; actual burn; cp_fuel; cp_supplies | nonduplicated supply/return quantities |  |
| milk_loss_link | sealed_rejects; collected_milk_loss; collected_milk_loss_atomic_case; sealed_rejects_atomic_case | Use SKU/lot/pack genealogy and actual contents/primary-pack disposition to quantify excluded upstream original-gate lost commodity amount and burden in linked commodity chain. Match actual units,liquid netmass/density-temperature and conversion evidence/owner; never infer original milk from total cleaning liquid or duplicate wholepack/parts. | actual source lot; original gate and dataset; pack count; label volume; actual liquid mass/density/temp; primary pack status; conversion basis/source; loss owner and already-included scope; integration result; cp_lots; cp_loss | quantified separate original-gate milk/primary-pack loss adjustment |  |

### Data Quality Requirements

| requirement_id | Applies to | Requirement | Evidence |
| --- | --- | --- | --- |
| quality_identity | all actual exchanges | Verify exact flow,property/unit group,state/medium and gate before final exchange use; keep unresolved actual configuration and support gaps explicit. | Full detail/support/compatibility proof |
| quality_cold | sealed_milk_distribution | Actual release,seals,manufacturer conditions,time-temperature excursions and quarantine/acceptance disposition must be traceable; no shelf-life reset or guaranteed safety from a PCR pass. | Lot/label/logger/decision records |
| quality_quantities | milk and losses | Label volume,actual liquid mass,density-temperature,pack count,primary tare and cleaning-water mixture stay distinct with measured source evidence. | Weighing/composition/conversion and stock reconciliation |
| quality_resources | all actual resources | Verify own/provider/transport/coldchain,full-asset life and actual environmental/waste scope once; investigate gaps rather than assumed zeros. | Coverage/period/driver/receiver/lifetime records |
| quality_chain | full commodity chain | Quantify saleable and lost commodity upstream including original primary packaging once outside this add-on before complete-chain use. | Original-gate conversion and actual integrated scope evidence |

| requirement_id | applies_to | requirement | evidence |
| --- | --- | --- | --- |
| electricity | sealed_milk_distribution | Which supply point, AC/DC state, voltage and supplier dataset cover the meter record? Reconcile the listed AC row with any evidenced other supply; do not use the AC UUID for a different carrier. Include actual cold-room compressors/fans/defrost,lighting and handling meters, with their consumer periods; do not repeat carrier/provider-embedded electricity. Range evidence need: Need actual room/product/ambient conditions,meters,occupancy and idle/defrost/changeover records with physical all-consumer driver; no universal kWh per pack or tonne. Measurement evidence: protocol `cp_cold`; original record basis Energy / kWh. The original amount constraint “Attributed measured electricity / N; cp_cold.” applies separately only to identity/unit-compatible individual rows; it creates no category-total exchange and does not assign the original unit to a different material or service. Do not normalize an already-per-reference quantity again. Defined flow cards: `electricity_ac`. Other actual states require the specific evidence decision above before any identity is assigned. This evidence record is not an exchange and cannot produce a category-total quantity. | `cp_cold`; actual source-linked native records |
| cleaning_water | sealed_milk_distribution | Does the supplier record establish treated tap water, or a different named water quality/source? Identify the supply state and gate; do not replace a non-tap-water supply with the tap-water card. Record actual premises/container cleaning, not processing or diluting the milk; no water enters unopened merchandise in normal service. Actual environmental water requires a source-specific input. Range evidence need: Need use,outlet and retention evidence,including any milk-contaminated cleanup state; wastewater volume is not pure water or a default milk loss. Measurement evidence: protocol `cp_water`; original record basis Volume / m3. The original amount constraint “Actual metered attributable water / N; cp_water.” applies separately only to identity/unit-compatible individual rows; it creates no category-total exchange and does not assign the original unit to a different material or service. Do not normalize an already-per-reference quantity again. Defined flow cards: `cleaning_water_liquid_tap`. Other actual states require the specific evidence decision above before any identity is assigned. This evidence record is not an exchange and cannot produce a category-total quantity. | `cp_water`; actual source-linked native records |
| cleaning_products | sealed_milk_distribution | Obtain the purchased SKU, formulation/SDS, supplied concentration, physical state, purpose and stock/issue records for the named cleaning or maintenance duty in this record. Identify the actual non-detergent material individually; do not prescribe a chemical, filter substrate or dose from this PCR. Actual SKU/formulation for floors/equipment, not a prescribed food-contact chemical or milk ingredient. Native volume/count supplies require own exchanges or evidenced conversion. Range evidence need: Need native quantity,active/carrier composition,actual dilution and unit/density/temperature source; no amount or emission inferred from a safety label. Measurement evidence: protocol `cp_supplies`; original record basis Mass / kg. The original amount constraint “Attributed preparation supplied / N; cp_supplies.” applies separately only to identity/unit-compatible individual rows; it creates no category-total exchange and does not assign the original unit to a different material or service. Do not normalize an already-per-reference quantity again. Defined flow cards: `cleaning_products_synthetic_detergent`. Other actual states require the specific evidence decision above before any identity is assigned. This evidence record is not an exchange and cannot produce a category-total quantity. | `cp_supplies`; actual source-linked native records |
| secondary_packing | sealed_milk_distribution | Obtain the package bill/specification, material or laminate identity and actual added-versus-inherited ownership. Determine each missing sleeve, seal, label, strap or support identity from that record; an integral composite is not several additive material exchanges. Only additional wraps/liners/labels/cartons actually supplied by the wholesaler. The prefilled bottle/carton and primary closure already belong to the merchandise upstream chain, not a new packing input for each resale. Range evidence need: Need actual native Count/Area/Length/Mass unit,stock and return proof; expand native unit and make any mass view nonadditive, no assumed wrap per order. Measurement evidence: protocol `cp_supplies`; original record basis Mass / kg. The original amount constraint “Attributed added packing supply / N; cp_supplies.” applies separately only to identity/unit-compatible individual rows; it creates no category-total exchange and does not assign the original unit to a different material or service. Do not normalize an already-per-reference quantity again. Defined flow cards: `secondary_packing_pe_film`; `secondary_packing_paperboard_carton`. Other actual states require the specific evidence decision above before any identity is assigned. This evidence record is not an exchange and cannot produce a category-total quantity. | `cp_supplies`; actual source-linked native records |
| refrigerant_makeup | sealed_milk_distribution | Obtain the circuit/equipment identifier, fluid designation, composition and service record. Distinguish new make-up, installed charge, recovered reusable fluid, contained unusable fluid and each actually released chemical; the chemical identity is not established by the present route evidence. Record actual supplied fluid and composition separately from equipment charge,recovery,waste and release. No refrigerant type or make-up-to-emission equivalence is assumed. Range evidence need: Need mixture identity,component fractions/bases,service stocks and actual charging/recovery/fates with units; unresolved imbalance is investigated, not atmospheric loss by default. Measurement evidence: protocol `cp_refrigerant`; original record basis Mass / kg. The original amount constraint “Attributed supplied refrigerant mass / N; cp_refrigerant.” applies separately only to identity/unit-compatible individual rows; it creates no category-total exchange and does not assign the original unit to a different material or service. Do not normalize an already-per-reference quantity again. This evidence record is not an exchange and cannot produce a category-total quantity. | `cp_refrigerant`; actual source-linked native records |
| provider_jobs | sealed_milk_distribution | Obtain the provider contract/completed-result record for each named duty in this record, with native billed physical unit and included resources. Identify the individual service result; inspection, cleaning and handling are different services, and price/hours cannot be relabelled as Item(s). Use a completed physically defined counted job only when full resource scope is documented. Providers sold by pallet-day,hour,mass,energy or freight require actual native-unit exchanges/support. Range evidence need: Need completion gate,resource/asset/temperature/treatment scope and overlap owner; payment is not physical completion and time is not Count. Measurement evidence: protocol `cp_provider`; original record basis Count / Item(s). The original amount constraint “Assigned completed provider job quantity / N; cp_provider.” applies separately only to identity/unit-compatible individual rows; it creates no category-total exchange and does not assign the original unit to a different material or service. Do not normalize an already-per-reference quantity again. This evidence record is not an exchange and cannot produce a category-total quantity. | `cp_provider`; actual source-linked native records |
| shared_assets | sealed_milk_distribution | For each explicitly named asset in this record, obtain the asset register identifier, configuration and matching complete-lifecycle dataset. The missing decision is the individual asset/service identity and lifetime all-user denominator; a warehouse, forklift and pallet cannot share one Count exchange or inherit a default life. Include actual refrigeration/warehouse/handling/monitoring assets and reusable crates with manufacture,cleaning/maintenance,replacements and end-of-life across all users and periods. Range evidence need: Need actual compatible lifetime driver,observed history and supported remainder/termination; crate trips are service use,not new crate manufacture every trip. Measurement evidence: protocol `cp_assets`; original record basis Count / Item(s). The original amount constraint “Assigned complete asset equivalents / N; cp_assets.” applies separately only to identity/unit-compatible individual rows; it creates no category-total exchange and does not assign the original unit to a different material or service. Do not normalize an already-per-reference quantity again. This evidence record is not an exchange and cannot produce a category-total quantity. | `cp_assets`; actual source-linked native records |
| freight | sealed_milk_distribution | For each actual inbound, outbound, return and waste leg, obtain mode/vehicle, temperature service, origin/destination, actual load and distance plus provider coverage. The missing mode/configuration prevents selection of one freight identity; never collapse unlike modes into one kg*km flow. Actual relevant load/route legs with unique commodity/carrier/service owner,including refrigeration and empty returns where covered. Use complete carrier scope or direct resources once. Range evidence need: Need actual loads/tare,distances,factors/units/sources and any allocation shares plus all-consumer drivers; record cold-chain handover and temperature-control responsibility. Measurement evidence: protocol `cp_freight`; original record basis Mass * distance / kg*km. The original amount constraint “Attributed actual kg*km / N; cp_freight.” applies separately only to identity/unit-compatible individual rows; it creates no category-total exchange and does not assign the original unit to a different material or service. Do not normalize an already-per-reference quantity again. This evidence record is not an exchange and cannot produce a category-total quantity. | `cp_freight`; actual source-linked native records |
| usable_extra_returns | sealed_milk_distribution | Match the external return ticket to exactly one input SKU, state and native unit, and identify the receiver. Under consumed-only input accounting omit its matched return exchange; merchandise returns and closing inventory are separate audit records. Only matched actual unused secondary packing/cleaning supplies returned to external ownership. Merchandise returns,reusable crate circulation and closing stocks have separate ledgers. Range evidence need: Need original supply identity/native quantity,state and receiver,with either gross input/separate return output or consumed-only input omitting matched return exchange. Measurement evidence: protocol `cp_supplies`; original record basis Mass / kg. The original amount constraint “Measured attributable outward usable supply return / N; cp_supplies.” applies separately only to identity/unit-compatible individual rows; it creates no category-total exchange and does not assign the original unit to a different material or service. Do not normalize an already-per-reference quantity again. Defined flow cards: `usable_extra_returns_detergent_return`; `usable_extra_returns_pe_film_return`. Other actual states require the specific evidence decision above before any identity is assigned. This evidence record is not an exchange and cannot produce a category-total quantity. | `cp_supplies`; actual source-linked native records |
| usable_refrigerant_return | sealed_milk_distribution | Obtain the circuit/equipment identifier, fluid designation, composition and service record. Distinguish new make-up, installed charge, recovered reusable fluid, contained unusable fluid and each actually released chemical; the chemical identity is not established by the present route evidence. Only measured actual usable fluid crossing outward to a documented owner/gate. Fluid recovered and retained as closing stock is not an outward export; do not assume recovered fluid is usable without state/receiver evidence. Its original charge/supply provenance must be identified; an asset-carried initial charge is not a reduction of operating make-up. Range evidence need: Require matched fluid/composition/native mass,transfer/receiver and original supply ownership. Apply gross supply input with separate usable-return output OR consumed-only supply omitting that matched return exchange; no second subtraction or automatic substitution credit. Consumed-only subtraction needs matched same-scope standalone supply inventory; other provenance,including asset initial charge,remains a Product transfer without automatic credit or unrelated input subtraction. Recovered retained fluid is internal stock,not new receipt. Measurement evidence: protocol `cp_refrigerant`; original record basis Mass / kg. The original amount constraint “Measured attributable actual usable fluid outward / N; cp_refrigerant.” applies separately only to identity/unit-compatible individual rows; it creates no category-total exchange and does not assign the original unit to a different material or service. Do not normalize an already-per-reference quantity again. This evidence record is not an exchange and cannot produce a category-total quantity. | `cp_refrigerant`; actual source-linked native records |
| sealed_rejects | sealed_milk_distribution | Obtain the independent transfer ticket for the actual outlet described in this record, including parent item/SKU, physical state, retained composition, receiver and treatment scope. Match it to one listed physical case; an unmatched part, fluid or contaminated mixture needs its own named identity, not this record ID as a waste flow. Only actual documented waste disposition,not automatic classification of every expired,quarantined or returned unit. Record compound milk-plus-pack mass/state and receiver; if separated into contents/pack wastes,do not also count whole units. Range evidence need: Need actual disposition,pack count,gross/tare/net contents,label volume versus measured liquid mass/density/temp and separate original-gate lost-commodity linkage; do not treat an unopened pack as wastewater. Measurement evidence: protocol `cp_lots`; original record basis Mass / kg. The original amount constraint “Measured attributable whole sealed reject mass / N; cp_lots.” applies separately only to identity/unit-compatible individual rows; it creates no category-total exchange and does not assign the original unit to a different material or service. Do not normalize an already-per-reference quantity again. Defined flow cards: `sealed_rejects_atomic_case`. Other actual states require the specific evidence decision above before any identity is assigned. This evidence record is not an exchange and cannot produce a category-total quantity. | `cp_lots`; actual source-linked native records |
| collected_milk_loss | sealed_milk_distribution | Obtain the independent transfer ticket for the actual outlet described in this record, including parent item/SKU, physical state, retained composition, receiver and treatment scope. Match it to one listed physical case; an unmatched part, fluid or contaminated mixture needs its own named identity, not this record ID as a waste flow. Only actual accidental breach/leak collected as milk-containing liquid. Unopened normal service does not imply intentional decanting,reprocessing or a wastewater discharge. Range evidence need: Need actual composition,milk mass/density/temp,cleaning-water mixing and receiver; do not equate total mixed liquid mass with original milk or repeat whole-pack waste. Measurement evidence: protocol `cp_loss`; original record basis Mass / kg. The original amount constraint “Measured attributable collected liquid-milk waste / N; cp_loss.” applies separately only to identity/unit-compatible individual rows; it creates no category-total exchange and does not assign the original unit to a different material or service. Do not normalize an already-per-reference quantity again. Defined flow cards: `collected_milk_loss_atomic_case`. Other actual states require the specific evidence decision above before any identity is assigned. This evidence record is not an exchange and cannot produce a category-total quantity. | `cp_loss`; actual source-linked native records |
| packing_waste | sealed_milk_distribution | Obtain the independent transfer ticket for the actual outlet described in this record, including parent item/SKU, physical state, retained composition, receiver and treatment scope. Match it to one listed physical case; an unmatched part, fluid or contaminated mixture needs its own named identity, not this record ID as a waste flow. Only packing physically separated in actual loss handling or added packing used here. Original primary packaging production remains outside this service; actual waste handling remains inside,with whole-pack nonduplication. Range evidence need: Need actual material,tare/contamination and receiver/recovery evidence; no automatic substitution credit or assumption that all received primary packs become warehouse waste. Measurement evidence: protocol `cp_waste`; original record basis Mass / kg. The original amount constraint “Measured attributable separated packing waste / N; cp_waste.” applies separately only to identity/unit-compatible individual rows; it creates no category-total exchange and does not assign the original unit to a different material or service. Do not normalize an already-per-reference quantity again. Defined flow cards: `packing_waste_paper_pack`; `packing_waste_metal_pack`; `packing_waste_plastic_pack`. Other actual states require the specific evidence decision above before any identity is assigned. This evidence record is not an exchange and cannot produce a category-total quantity. | `cp_waste`; actual source-linked native records |
| cleaning_effluent | sealed_milk_distribution | Obtain the independent transfer ticket for the actual outlet described in this record, including parent item/SKU, physical state, retained composition, receiver and treatment scope. Match it to one listed physical case; an unmatched part, fluid or contaminated mixture needs its own named identity, not this record ID as a waste flow. Actual collected cleaning/defrost liquid with separately recorded milk/chemical contamination. Direct environmental discharge needs actual receiving water and substance exchanges,not this contained-waste proxy. Range evidence need: Need origin,actual volume/composition/density/temp,containment and treatment boundary; no drain equals pure milk or automatic emission species. Measurement evidence: protocol `cp_water`; original record basis Volume / m3. The original amount constraint “Metered or measured attributable contained effluent / N; cp_water.” applies separately only to identity/unit-compatible individual rows; it creates no category-total exchange and does not assign the original unit to a different material or service. Do not normalize an already-per-reference quantity again. Defined flow cards: `cleaning_effluent_aqueous_cleaning`. Other actual states require the specific evidence decision above before any identity is assigned. This evidence record is not an exchange and cannot produce a category-total quantity. | `cp_water`; actual source-linked native records |
| refrigerant_waste | sealed_milk_distribution | Obtain the circuit/equipment identifier, fluid designation, composition and service record. Distinguish new make-up, installed charge, recovered reusable fluid, contained unusable fluid and each actually released chemical; the chemical identity is not established by the present route evidence. Actual nonusable fluid removed to a verified receiving recovery/treatment operation,distinct from usable return,retained recovered stock and atmospheric components. Do not label every recovery as Waste or as emitted. Range evidence need: Require actual fluid/mixture composition,container tare,net fluid,transfer and receiver/treatment gate with complete transport/resource coverage once. Retain nonreturned upstream fluid-production burden and actual receiving recovery/disposal treatment without automatic credit. Measurement evidence: protocol `cp_refrigerant`; original record basis Mass / kg. The original amount constraint “Measured attributable contained waste fluid / N; cp_refrigerant.” applies separately only to identity/unit-compatible individual rows; it creates no category-total exchange and does not assign the original unit to a different material or service. Do not normalize an already-per-reference quantity again. This evidence record is not an exchange and cannot produce a category-total quantity. | `cp_refrigerant`; actual source-linked native records |
| refrigerant_air | sealed_milk_distribution | Obtain the circuit/equipment identifier, fluid designation, composition and service record. Distinguish new make-up, installed charge, recovered reusable fluid, contained unusable fluid and each actually released chemical; the chemical identity is not established by the present route evidence. Expand actual component mass and receiving air identity. Recovery,remaining equipment charge,contained fluid waste and external returns are separate fates; make-up alone does not prove release. Range evidence need: Need charge/stock/recovery/fate reconciliation and mixture fraction basis/source,uncertainty and investigated discrepancies; complete species factor is not multiplied twice. Measurement evidence: protocol `cp_refrigerant`; original record basis Mass / kg. The original amount constraint “Measured or audited actual component air release / N; cp_refrigerant.” applies separately only to identity/unit-compatible individual rows; it creates no category-total exchange and does not assign the original unit to a different material or service. Do not normalize an already-per-reference quantity again. This evidence record is not an exchange and cannot produce a category-total quantity. | `cp_refrigerant`; actual source-linked native records |
| other_direct_species | sealed_milk_distribution | Identify each measured release at its source/event, chemical or particle-size identity, origin and receiving compartment using the emission/sampling record. Unknown species, unresolved particle fraction or unknown medium must remain a specific evidence gap; neither total chemical use nor stock loss supplies that identity. Conditional actual combustion,chemical spill,water or other non-refrigerant substance release,with actual medium. Milk/COD/total cleaner is not a default elementary species; actual direct water paths need dedicated exchanges. Range evidence need: Need substance/medium plus actual release or matched factor/composition/fate operands,units,bases and sources. Missing stock or milk mass is not inferred gaseous/aqueous emission. Measurement evidence: protocol `cp_emissions`; original record basis Mass / kg. The original amount constraint “Measured or justified actual-activity species release / N; cp_emissions.” applies separately only to identity/unit-compatible individual rows; it creates no category-total exchange and does not assign the original unit to a different material or service. Do not normalize an already-per-reference quantity again. Defined flow cards: `other_direct_species_co2_fossil_air`; `other_direct_species_methane_fossil_air`; `other_direct_species_nitrous_oxide_air`. Other actual states require the specific evidence decision above before any identity is assigned. This evidence record is not an exchange and cannot produce a category-total quantity. | `cp_emissions`; actual source-linked native records |


## 9. Validation Rules

| rule_id | applies_to | rule | source_ids |
| --- | --- | --- | --- |
| validate_reference | accepted_service | Require unique positive actual B2Bacceptance and reference qualifiers; pack,line,pallet or canceled/quarantined order is not automatically a completed consignment. |  |
| validate_state | sealed_milk_distribution | Confirm released pasteurized cow drinking milk,unopened primary seals,actual manufacturer conditions and observed cold-chain/lot/time gate. Reject rawmilk,UHTambient,reprocessing or generic other dairy substitution. | codex-milk-hygiene-2004 |
| validate_units | all inventory | Preserve actual supplier/provider units and compatible conversions,N and support; no1L=1kg,nominalpack=measuredmilk,margin=Count or energy-property substitute. |  |
| validate_fates | stock and losses | Returns/quarantine are actual lot states; sealedpack waste,actual separated milk/pack and contaminated cleaning water require exclusive quantities/receiver proof. No mass deficit or top-up alone proves emissions. |  |
| validate_resources | shared assets and providers | Full-life manufacture,cleaning/maintenance,replacement/EOL and compatible drivers/history/remainder/termination must be evidenced; close all-consumer meter/period totals and scope ownership. |  |
| validate_release | actual fluid/species exchanges | Require actual named refrigerant/substance,medium,activity/factor/composition/fate units,bases and sources,with uncertainty/unknowns disclosed. Complete species factors not multiplied by component/fate again. |  |
| validate_chain | commodity and service integration | No traded milk or original filled-pack production inside this add-on; quantify original-gate lost and saleable burden outside it exactly once with density-temperature/pack basis and disjoint transport/treatment before whole-chain completeness. |  |
| validate_concrete_identity_decisions | all inventory rows | Resolve each actual identity evidence decision to a physically specific card and native quantity or evidenced non-applicability. Evidence-checkpoint IDs are not exchanges. Missing occurrence, species, state, receiver or provider configuration blocks final data completion; no assumed zero. Whole streams and components, gross inputs and matched returns must remain mutually exclusive where required. |  |
