# Silo-based dry wheat own-account wholesale services

## 1. Scope and Applicability

This PCR defines a service add-on for an own-account merchant that buys already-dry, already-clean non-seed wheat grain, takes ownership and resale risk, operates commercial silo handling, storage surveillance and ambient aeration, and resells a documented consignment to a business buyer. The end gate is actual agreed commercial handover with identity, quantity, quality and acceptance recorded; physical dispatch alone or an unpaid invoice alone does not establish that gate. The reference is one completed consignment, qualified by actual grain mass and residence time.

It excludes growing, harvest, deliberate drying or primary cleaning, seed production, milling/feed manufacture, retail, fee/commission agency and independently sold storage-only services. A separately required remediation or processing operation needs its own declared boundary and all actual upstream service inputs; it must not be hidden as loss-free storage. FAO storage guidance supports receipt/handling/condition-monitoring roles but does not establish ownership, universal safe thresholds or an inventory recipe. All applicable local requirements and contractual criteria must be supplied for the actual data package.

This is an operational wholesale-service dataset, not a delivered-wheat dataset or a corporate inventory. Upstream manufacture of ALL traded wheat, including wheat subsequently lost, is excluded from its exchanges. The linked commodity system must quantify and include the upstream loss adjustment once, alongside the successfully sold commodity, before a complete-chain claim. Physical waste handling and its treatment are included in this service according to declared coverage; the linked commodity adjustment must not duplicate them.

## 3. Reference Flow

| Field | Value |
| --- | --- |
| What | Completed silo-based dry wheat own-account wholesale consignment service |
| How much | 1 completed wholesale consignment service |
| How well | Actual non-seed wheat identity, condition/quality acceptance, ownership resale and business-buyer handover; actual mass, moisture and storage time disclosed |
| How long or cycle | Actual receipt-to-commercial-handover period; reporting-period stock carry and asset lifecycle handled separately |
| reference_flow_link | `accepted_service` |

| Field | Value |
| --- | --- |
| Reference amount | 1 |
| Reference product flow | Completed silo-based dry wheat own-account wholesale consignment service |
| Reference flow property | Number of items `01846770-4cfe-4a25-8ad9-919d8d378345` |
| Reference unit group | Units of items `5beb6eed-33a9-47b8-9ede-1dfe8f679159` |
| Reference unit | Item(s) |
| Required qualifiers | consignment_id; ownership_and_resale_risk; buyer_business_role; contract_handover_gate; actual_net_mass; mass_unit; moisture_wet_basis; grain_class_grade; accepted_quality_criteria; silo_route; storage_start_end; geography; period; transport_coverage; linked_commodity_loss_adjustment |

All operational amounts use the same declared service-reference basis. N is the number of unique accepted wholesale consignments in the same attributed lot/campaign period, net of actual cancellations, and N must be positive. Shared site burdens include failed/rejected attempts assigned through an evidenced physical driver; such attempts do not add accepted output counts. A consignment is the actual contractual lot/handover unit; subdividing invoices or truck movements must not inflate N. Different mass, quality and storage profiles are not comparable simply because each counts as one. Required qualifiers must be declared in actual data-package fields.

## 4. Measurement and Unit Rules

| rule_id | Applies to | Required property | Required unit | Rule |
| --- | --- | --- | --- | --- |
| service_count | reference product | Number of items | Item(s) | Use actual accepted consignment IDs; reconcile ownership and handover/cancellation, record N > 0 and all comparability qualifiers. Count is not tonnes, truckloads or monetary turnover. |
| grain_stock_basis | grain memorandum stock and waste grain | Mass | kg | Record as-is mass and wet-basis moisture fraction for each lot/state; dry mass equals as-is mass times (1 - moisture fraction). Harmonize actual units and sampling periods before reconciliation; water change is not dry-matter loss. |
| native_units | all inventory rows | Native compatible property | Actual native unit | Keep measured native units for actual fuel, packaging, assets and provider services. Any conversion requires explicit source state, density/composition if needed, factor, unit and uncertainty; non-additive mass views are audit-only. |


## 5. System Boundary

### Boundary Abstraction

| Field | Value |
| --- | --- |
| declared_starting_condition | Already-dry cleaned wheat accepted into merchant ownership at declared supplier gate; actual stock/quality/moisture and any prior transport coverage stated |
| starting_condition_role | Declared input-state fact for a service add-on, not a zero-burden claim about wheat |
| product_classification_scope | Own-account business-buyer dry wheat wholesale subset of CPC 61011 |
| recursive_input_rule | Upstream wheat stock remains a memorandum; do not recurse wholesale service into its own turnover. Actual outsourced support uses separate provider result and explicit non-overlap. |
| upstream_dataset_requirement | Verified appropriate upstream supplies/providers/asset lifecycle data; linked commodity-production and attributable-loss demand resolved outside this service before complete-chain claims |
| disclosure | Actual starting/ending grain stock; receipts/returns/dispatch/losses; agreed commercial gate; scope of freight, waste treatment and assets; exclusions and all unknown coverage |

| rule_id | applies_to | rule | source_ids |
| --- | --- | --- | --- |
| boundary_service | wholesale | Inventory the wholesale operation, its actual consumed supplies, energy, attributable assets, actual support and owned transport/waste-treatment scope once. Successful through-traded wheat and its lost fraction have no production exchange in this service; maintain a separate physical grain ledger and mandatory linked upstream commodity adjustment. |  |
| boundary_gate | wholesale | Declare actual receipt state and commercial handover; reject or cancelled dispatch is not accepted service output. Maintain ownership, physical custody and accounting periods separately. Fee agency and commodity processing are excluded. | unsd-cpc3-wholesale-2025 |
| boundary_grain | wholesale | Track initial dry usable wheat, actual silo residence, handling, monitoring and ambient aeration; existing quality is preserved without a default drying, fumigation or cleaning recipe. Record any actual corrective outsourced scope explicitly and avoid hidden processing. | fao-bulk-storage; fao-grain-aeration |


## 6. Process Inventory Structure

### Process Map

| process_id | process_name | inclusion | inclusion_condition | role | quantitative_reference |
| --- | --- | --- | --- | --- | --- |
| wholesale | Integrated ownership-based dry-wheat wholesale operation | required | Actual own-account dry wheat receipt, silo holding and business-buyer resale handover | Integrated service responsibility including failed handling/reject routes; no commodity production output | `accepted_service` |

Batch/consignment and campaign-period IDs own every stock transfer, monitoring record, cleaning event and dispatch. Ambient aeration and ordinary checking are activities within this one responsibility, not independently sold preservation or grading outputs. Actual refused deliveries are held, returned, separately processed or discarded with documented receivers and actual energy/waste; only accepted handovers count as N. Transferred grain between silos is an internal stock movement, never another purchase or accepted wholesale consignment.

All operational amounts use the same declared service-reference basis. N is the number of unique accepted wholesale consignments in the same attributed lot/campaign period, net of actual cancellations, and N must be positive. Shared site burdens include failed/rejected attempts assigned through an evidenced physical driver; such attempts do not add accepted output counts.

#### Inputs

##### Product flows

###### Actual alternating-current electricity at point of use (`electricity_ac`)

Only actual alternating-current electricity crossing this node boundary and not already inside a complete provider. The identity leaves provider, voltage, generation mix and delivery-loss allocation unspecified; collect them where required. Its ILCD reference property is named Net calorific value but the verified electricity flow defines an electrical-energy basis of 1 MJ; native kWh uses exactly 3.6 MJ per kWh, never a fuel heating-value factor. Direct-current or another unmatched electricity state stays in the residual requirement.

- Selected flow: Alternating current `455f0ef5-6118-4f2b-a3f5-1f75e0afe3ca`
- Flow property / unit: Energy / kWh
- Amount rule: Actual attributed electricity per reference flow; cp_energy.
- Value mode: `foreground_record`
- Specificity: `site_specific`
- Normalization basis: per reference flow
- Basis kind: `reference_flow`
- Evidence kind: `collected_record`
- Collection protocol: `cp_energy`

Range evidence need: Metered kWh by operation interval, actual aeration/handling hours, consignment residence and all-consumer attribution are needed. An empirical kWh guardrail needs independent comparable silo climate/load/quality evidence; missing generic Energy support and supplier identity remain separate gaps.

###### Actual separately identified supplied diesel fuel (`fuel_supply_diesel_supply`)

Only actual independently identified diesel within this operating-fuel requirement. The generic identity is Mass/kg; record actual fuel formulation, supplier, supply gate and native stock scope. When native quantity is litres, final kg conversion requires actual compatible density, temperature/state, mass-per-volume unit and source; no catalogue default density or heating value. Supplied stock and burned fuel are separate records. Other fuels remain residual and neither fuel purchase nor unexplained imbalance proves combustion or emissions.

- Selected flow: Diesel fuel `9d258d75-6792-4f1c-9856-81602ed8f816`
- Flow property / unit: Volume / L
- Amount rule: Actual attributed fuel supply per reference flow; cp_supplies.
- Value mode: `foreground_record`
- Specificity: `site_specific`
- Normalization basis: per reference flow
- Basis kind: `reference_flow`
- Evidence kind: `collected_record`
- Collection protocol: `cp_supplies`

Range evidence need: Use actual grade and native litres or mass, opening/receipts/closing and matched usable returns; any density/temperature conversion needs traceable basis. The supplied-to-burn relationship requires measured burn or complete disjoint fates, not a presumed combustion fraction.

###### Actual liquid treated tap-water supply (`water_supplied_liquid_tap`)

Applicable only when the actual source is treated tap water supplied for the declared use. Preserve actual supplier, quality, temperature/state and provider boundary; do not assume that every water supply is tap water. Ice, bottled/mineral/reclaimed/untreated water and direct environmental withdrawal stay in their actual separate identities. Keep the parent native mass or volume basis. For any final mass-reference conversion, require actual compatible density/state evidence; the catalogue secondary-volume relationship is not a default site density.

- Selected flow: Tap water `d1e0e36c-07f0-4a75-bdcb-efb5d9e2ac36`
- Flow property / unit: Volume / m3
- Amount rule: Actual attributed water supplied per reference flow; cp_supplies.
- Value mode: `foreground_record`
- Specificity: `site_specific`
- Normalization basis: per reference flow
- Basis kind: `reference_flow`
- Evidence kind: `collected_record`
- Collection protocol: `cp_supplies`

Range evidence need: Retain actual metered purchased volume, cleaning/sanitary purpose, service period and supplier coverage. Any per-consignment water guardrail requires the same actual cleaning scope and allocation; it does not validate grain moisture or imply direct abstraction.

###### Actual independently recorded synthetic detergent supply (`operating_supplies_synthetic_detergent`)

Only actual synthetic surfactant detergent identified by product/formulation, supplied state and use records. Measure net supplied material excluding package tare; retain concentrate/dilution-water distinctions and never count whole formulation and components additively. Soap, disinfectants, wipes, filters and other materials remain under their separate actual identities; no cleaning recipe, dose or occurrence is assumed.

- Selected flow: Detergent `1c57d123-df57-49ab-b9d4-957403beb8a5`
- Flow property / unit: Mass / kg
- Amount rule: Actual attributed operating supplies per reference flow; cp_supplies.
- Value mode: `foreground_record`
- Specificity: `site_specific`
- Normalization basis: per reference flow
- Basis kind: `reference_flow`
- Evidence kind: `collected_record`
- Collection protocol: `cp_supplies`

Range evidence need: Collect actual SKU, formulation and concentration, native unit, stock-adjusted consumption, usable returns and separately measured waste/release fates. A chemical-application or maintenance guardrail needs current actual route and product evidence; no generic fumigant dose or direct-release fraction is provided.

#### Outputs

##### Product flows

###### Completed silo-based dry wheat own-account wholesale consignment service (`accepted_service`)

One actual unique consignment with ownership-based resale to a business buyer and recorded dispatch, quality/state, agreed commercial handover and accepted net grain quantity. This output is the wholesale service, not the wheat commodity.

- Selected flow: Completed silo-based dry wheat own-account wholesale consignment service
- Flow property / unit: Count / Item(s)
- Amount rule: 1 Item(s)
- Value mode: `fixed_value`
- Specificity: `site_specific`
- Normalization basis: per reference flow
- Basis kind: `reference_flow`
- Evidence kind: `collected_record`
- Collection protocol: `cp_consignment`

Range evidence need: The fixed count defines normalization only. Actual consignment mass, moisture, quality, storage time and ownership/handover evidence are required; there is no universal tonne equivalent or generic lot size.

###### Unused synthetic detergent returned to supplier (`usable_returns_detergent_return`)

Only an independently evidenced actual unused synthetic detergent returned to supplier in this process is covered. Record its own physical state, net kg, event/source and handover gate. Other states or receivers require their own identity decision `usable_returns`; this card is not a substitute for them. Do not infer occurrence or zero from missing records. Match the unused material exactly to input `operating_supplies_synthetic_detergent` in formulation, supplied state and native mass. It is an external usable return, not waste, closing stock or internal circulation. Include this output only with the gross-supply convention; omit the matched return output entirely when the input has already been netted by that return. No automatic avoided-production credit.

- Selected flow: Detergent `1c57d123-df57-49ab-b9d4-957403beb8a5`
- Flow property / unit: Mass / kg
- Amount rule: Actual exclusively assigned kg for `usable_returns_detergent_return` / accepted N once; preserve an already-per-reference quantity without dividing again.
- Value mode: `foreground_record`
- Specificity: `site_specific`
- Normalization basis: per reference flow
- Basis kind: `reference_flow`
- Evidence kind: `collected_record`
- Collection protocol: `cp_supplies`

Range evidence need: Require event-linked native kg, state/composition, receiver or provider gate, allocation records and exclusion links to all whole/component or matched-input records; use protocol `cp_supplies`. No numeric default or conversion factor is supplied. A different native unit requires evidenced conversion before use.

##### Waste flows

###### Discarded dry wheat grain (`waste_grain_atomic_case`)

Conditional on independently recorded actual Discarded dry wheat grain. This card covers only that named physical state, with its own actual net quantity, retained contents and receiver gate. Other parts, fragments, free liquids, separate packing or cleanup carriers remain identity evidence decisions under `waste_grain`; do not shift the boundary, infer an event, use a stock deficit as discard, or count a retained component as another outlet. A genuinely co-collected mixture requires its own exact identity. Use the original native-unit amount protocol only for this exclusively identified case; reconcile every other actual fate separately.

- Selected flow: Discarded dry wheat grain
- Flow property / unit: Mass / kg
- Amount rule: Actual attributed waste grain per reference flow; cp_grain.
- Value mode: `foreground_record`
- Specificity: `site_specific`
- Normalization basis: per reference flow
- Basis kind: `reference_flow`
- Evidence kind: `collected_record`
- Collection protocol: `cp_grain`

Range evidence need: Measure actual contained waste net mass and representative moisture, lot and receiving route; reconcile its dry matter against actual grain stock and linked lost-commodity demand. Do not impose historical FAO loss percentages, infer spoilage from water loss, or use captured dust as airborne-release quantity.

###### Collected wheat-grain dust, contained solid (`waste_grain_captured_wheat_dust`)

Only an independently evidenced actual collected wheat-grain dust, contained solid in this process is covered. Record its own physical state, net kg, event/source and handover gate. Other states or receivers require their own identity decision `waste_grain`; this card is not a substitute for them. Do not infer occurrence or zero from missing records. Activate only for an actual independently collected transfer to a waste receiver, not for a component retained in a whole article, pack or mixed collected stream. Keep retained constituents as non-additive composition records. No opening, cutting, dismantling, deliberate drying, recovery yield or treatment route is prescribed. Treatment/transport coverage has one owner.

- Selected flow: Collected wheat-grain dust, contained solid
- Flow property / unit: Mass / kg
- Amount rule: Actual exclusively assigned kg for `waste_grain_captured_wheat_dust` / accepted N once; preserve an already-per-reference quantity without dividing again.
- Value mode: `foreground_record`
- Specificity: `site_specific`
- Normalization basis: per reference flow
- Basis kind: `reference_flow`
- Evidence kind: `collected_record`
- Collection protocol: `cp_grain`

Range evidence need: Require event-linked native kg, state/composition, receiver or provider gate, allocation records and exclusion links to all whole/component or matched-input records; use protocol `cp_grain`. No numeric default or conversion factor is supplied. A different native unit requires evidenced conversion before use.

###### Collected aqueous premises-cleaning wastewater sent to treatment (`contained_wastewater_aqueous_cleaning`)

Only an independently evidenced actual collected aqueous premises-cleaning wastewater sent to treatment in this process is covered. Record its own physical state, net m3, event/source and handover gate. Other states or receivers require their own identity decision `contained_wastewater`; this card is not a substitute for them. Do not infer occurrence or zero from missing records. Activate only for an actual independently collected transfer to a waste receiver, not for a component retained in a whole article, pack or mixed collected stream. Keep retained constituents as non-additive composition records. No opening, cutting, dismantling, deliberate drying, recovery yield or treatment route is prescribed. Treatment/transport coverage has one owner. This is the aqueous premises-cleaning stream, with its actual dissolved/suspended load and measured received volume. Exclude separately collected undiluted merchandise, organic fluid, condensate or sanitary wastewater. If these actually mix before one transfer, identify that real mixture separately; do not sum constituent volumes or label it pure cleaning water. No quantity is inferred from supplied water.

- Selected flow: Collected aqueous premises-cleaning wastewater sent to treatment
- Flow property / unit: Volume / m3
- Amount rule: Actual exclusively assigned m3 for `contained_wastewater_aqueous_cleaning` / accepted N once; preserve an already-per-reference quantity without dividing again.
- Value mode: `foreground_record`
- Specificity: `site_specific`
- Normalization basis: per reference flow
- Basis kind: `reference_flow`
- Evidence kind: `collected_record`
- Collection protocol: `cp_environment`

Range evidence need: Require event-linked native m3, state/composition, receiver or provider gate, allocation records and exclusion links to all whole/component or matched-input records; use protocol `cp_environment`. No numeric default or conversion factor is supplied. A different native unit requires evidenced conversion before use.

##### Elementary flows

###### Actual separately evidenced fossil carbon dioxide emitted to air (`species_releases_co2_fossil_air`)

Actual records establish fossil origin, carbon dioxide substance and direct air release. Preserve the reported carbon/CO2 basis; any carbon-to-CO2 calculation requires its own supported stoichiometry and no inferred factor or occurrence. This is a direct actual node release, not purchased-electricity/upstream/provider-covered emissions. The UUID denotes air with no finer subcompartment; resolve a different applicable compartment/origin under the residual requirement rather than relabelling it. Missing data is not zero.

- Selected flow: carbon dioxide (fossil) `08a91e70-3ddc-11dd-923d-0050c2490048`
- Flow property / unit: Mass / kg
- Amount rule: Actual attributed species releases per reference flow; cp_environment.
- Value mode: `foreground_record`
- Specificity: `site_specific`
- Normalization basis: per reference flow
- Basis kind: `reference_flow`
- Evidence kind: `collected_record`
- Collection protocol: `cp_environment`

Range evidence need: For each actual identified species or particle fraction and medium retain measured release or compatible measured activity and species factor, with composition/fate basis and sources if applicable. Dry-matter stock residual, dust captured as waste, safety limits or total formulated supply cannot establish a species release; complete factors are applied once.


###### Actual separately evidenced fossil methane emitted to air (`species_releases_methane_fossil_air`)

Actual records establish fossil origin, methane substance and direct air release. Biogenic or unknown-origin methane stays under the residual actual-species requirement and is never relabelled fossil. No leakage occurrence, gas fraction, quantity or emission factor is inferred. This is a direct actual node release, not purchased-electricity/upstream/provider-covered emissions. The UUID denotes air with no finer subcompartment; resolve a different applicable compartment/origin under the residual requirement rather than relabelling it. Missing data is not zero.

- Selected flow: methane (fossil) `08a91e70-3ddc-11dd-9610-0050c2490048`
- Flow property / unit: Mass / kg
- Amount rule: Actual attributed species releases per reference flow; cp_environment.
- Value mode: `foreground_record`
- Specificity: `site_specific`
- Normalization basis: per reference flow
- Basis kind: `reference_flow`
- Evidence kind: `collected_record`
- Collection protocol: `cp_environment`

Range evidence need: For each actual identified species or particle fraction and medium retain measured release or compatible measured activity and species factor, with composition/fate basis and sources if applicable. Dry-matter stock residual, dust captured as waste, safety limits or total formulated supply cannot establish a species release; complete factors are applied once.


###### Actual separately evidenced nitrous oxide emitted to air (`species_releases_nitrous_oxide_air`)

Actual records establish nitrous oxide substance and direct air release. Native quantity is mass of N2O, not nitrogen mass or molecular nitrogen; no emission factor or occurrence assumed. This is a direct actual node release, not purchased-electricity/upstream/provider-covered emissions. The UUID denotes air with no finer subcompartment; resolve a different applicable compartment/origin under the residual requirement rather than relabelling it. Missing data is not zero.

- Selected flow: nitrous oxide `08a91e70-3ddc-11dd-94c3-0050c2490048`
- Flow property / unit: Mass / kg
- Amount rule: Actual attributed species releases per reference flow; cp_environment.
- Value mode: `foreground_record`
- Specificity: `site_specific`
- Normalization basis: per reference flow
- Basis kind: `reference_flow`
- Evidence kind: `collected_record`
- Collection protocol: `cp_environment`

Range evidence need: For each actual identified species or particle fraction and medium retain measured release or compatible measured activity and species factor, with composition/fate basis and sources if applicable. Dry-matter stock residual, dust captured as waste, safety limits or total formulated supply cannot establish a species release; complete factors are applied once.

## 7. Allocation and Co-product Handling

| rule_id | applies_to | rule | source_ids |
| --- | --- | --- | --- |
| alloc_meter | wholesale | Prefer actual submeter and event assignments. Allocate remaining documented common operating burdens to all actual consumers by an evidenced compatible physical driver, such as handling mass for conveying or occupied grain-volume-time for space-related holding. Choose driver by causal use, keep total-consumer denominator and failed/rejected attempts, explain idle-capacity treatment; invoice value and equal consignment count are not default drivers. Divide attributable totals by N once. |  |
| alloc_assets | shared_assets | Identify asset and every consuming lot/site/period. Attribute its complete manufacture, actual maintenance, replacements and end-of-life burden by driver_used / driver_lifetime. Establish lifetime driver from observed use or observed history plus evidenced remaining use, replacement and termination assumptions, uncertainty and sensitivity. Use either asset-equivalent fraction / N OR lifecycle-complete provider quantity in native units / N, never both and never normalize twice. |  |
| alloc_supplies | operating supplies | For one actual native-unit SKU/state, S = attributed opening stock + external receipts - closing stock. Choose gross-with-outlets S / N and retain usable external returns, or consumed-only (S - usable external returns) / N with matched return omitted from credited exchange. Closing stock includes usable recovered closing stock; wastage and uncontained loss are not usable returns and retain upstream supply burden. Internal issues/returns do not create external purchases. |  |
| alloc_commodity_loss | grain memorandum | Keep all wheat-production burdens outside this service. Send attributed irrecoverable grain dry-matter loss L, accepted outbound grain dry matter G and existing commodity-dataset loss coverage to the linked commodity system. If G > 0 and its commodity baseline excludes this loss, upstream dry-wheat demand = G + L (factor (G + L) / G). Convert at the actual upstream reference moisture; for service linkage provide L / N. If matching losses are already included, reconcile instead of multiplying again. Waste treatment included here must not be repeated there. Unknown loss or attribution blocks complete-chain claims, never defaults to zero. |  |
| alloc_outlets | wholesale | No substitution credit from unusable grain, usable supply returns or unsold merchandise. Downgraded but usable sold grain retains actual state and receiving transaction; it is a documented physical merchandise exit, not an automatically burden-free coproduct. If genuinely independent intended co-products or processing appear, declare and review a new attribution boundary before final dataset use. |  |

Here G is net completed accepted outbound grain after actual cancellations and buyer-return reversals, not all physical dispatches. The physical stock balance separately retains gross physical dispatch and actual return receipts. Buyer-returned grain that remains merchant stock is not irrecoverable L. Storage-water changes must be reconciled at the actually measured state, including moisture sampling uncertainty.

Attribute only the individually identified physical case; retain other source-linked actual fates separately. Each native record belongs to exactly one exchange and any whole total is a non-additive audit. | kg | Each receipt, transfer, return, stocktake and dispatch | All stock periods and actual silo residence | Actual silo lots and their actual external handoffs | per reference flow | Calibrated scale/moisture method, grain stock reconciliation and linked commodity-loss interface |

Fuel delivered is not burn. Partition actual native records by flow_row_id and actual_identity_case; only evidenced cases activate.

Partition actual native records by flow_row_id and actual_identity_case; only evidenced cases activate. Typed and residual actual quantities are exclusive across the node, each physical outlet/input is assigned once and reconciles with a compatible same-scope non-additive total. Keep unknown occurrence/quantity unresolved, not zero. Any litre-to-kg diesel conversion requires actual compatible density, temperature/state, mass-per-volume unit and source; no default conversion. | Actual native SKU unit | Each external event and period stocktake | Complete attributed reporting periods | One SKU/state and actual silo activities | per reference flow | Matched returns, inventory reconciliation and conversion provenance |

### Calculation Rules

| rule_id | Applies to | Formula or rule | Inputs | Output | source_ids |
| --- | --- | --- | --- | --- | --- |
| count_and_attribution | all inventory rows | Collect actual operational totals using actual consignment, campaign and period keys. Attribute shared burdens with documented all-consumer physical drivers, then divide the attributed quantity by N once. Rejected/cancelled attempts retain attributable burdens but do not increase N. | cp_consignment; cp_energy; cp_supplies; cp_providers; cp_assets; cp_freight; cp_environment | Operational exchange quantity per reference flow |  |
| grain_dry_balance | grain memorandum and waste_grain; waste_grain_atomic_case | For each actual state D = net as-is mass times (1 - wet-basis moisture fraction). Dry opening + dry external receipts + dry buyer returns - dry closing - dry physical dispatch - dry supplier returns - dry useful other exits - dry contained waste - independently measured dry direct loss = unexplained residual. Internal transfers cancel. Investigate residual with uncertainty; do not label it emission or loss automatically. Water gain/loss is tracked separately and never equated with dry matter. | cp_grain | Stock reconciliation and identified dry-matter loss L per linked commodity consignment |  |
| commodity_link | grain memorandum | For actual attributed irrecoverable dry-grain loss L and accepted outbound dry-grain quantity G, send L / N to the commodity model. If G > 0 and the same loss is not already included upstream, commodity dry-grain demand is G + L, or multiplier (G + L) / G. Convert using actual upstream reference moisture and preserve responsibility/coverage. Treatment already in this service stays excluded from this production-only adjustment. Unknown loss, receiver or coverage blocks complete-chain finalization. | cp_grain; cp_consignment | Linked upstream commodity-loss adjustment, outside service exchanges |  |
| fuel_and_species | fuel_supply and species_releases; fuel_supply_diesel_supply; species_releases_co2_fossil_air; species_releases_methane_fossil_air; species_releases_nitrous_oxide_air | Upstream supply follows stock-adjusted input convention. Actual burn is measured or reconstructed from a complete disjoint fate ledger: carried closing, usable external return, contained nonburned waste, unrecovered nonburned loss and actual burn. A total spill tally is audit-only when its recovered/remaining fates already appear. Species release equals actual compatible activity times a species/medium-specific factor, or actual whole-fluid release times evidenced composition and fate. Do not multiply composition/fate again into a complete species factor. | cp_energy; cp_supplies; cp_environment | Actual supply, burn and identified species release views with once-only coverage |  |
| freight_service | freight | For each actual leg use net load in kg times distance in km; convert actual mass and length units before multiplication. Attribute included empty returns and provider coverage once; total attributable kg*km is expressed per reference flow. | cp_freight; cp_consignment | Actual kg*km per reference flow |  |

### Data Quality Requirements

| requirement_id | Applies to | Requirement | Evidence |
| --- | --- | --- | --- |
| quality_identity | all inventory rows | Verify actual material/service/species identity, property and unit before final exchange binding. A candidate semantic label and verified Count support are not a flow UUID. | Concrete identity/detail/support evidence |
| quality_grain | grain ledger | Preserve representative moisture sampling, scale calibration and actual stock states; resolve unexplained dry-matter residual, segregation and lot links. No universal loss, moisture, residence or aeration factor. | cp_grain; uncertainty and investigation records |
| quality_coverage | wholesale | Reconcile direct, provider, freight, assets, waste-treatment and linked commodity-loss boundaries; unknowns stay explicit. Quantitative guards require independent comparable evidence, not the maximum of the batch being validated. | Coverage matrix and missing-data register |
| quality_period | wholesale | Link stock, energy, assets, service handovers and actual returns/replacements/termination to all relevant periods; avoid duplication between opening/closing stock and another reporting period. | Period/asset/consignment trace ledger |

For cp_supplies, external_receipts means net product quantity after actual tare in the same native unit; retained receipt gross, tare and net quantities reconcile. For cp_freight, any shared leg uses an actual compatible physical driver with all-consumer denominator; the sum of attributed shares must equal the declared leg coverage, without allocating already net consignment loads twice.
Wastewater records retain actual collected and received aqueous volumes, composition and receiving treatment scope independently of purchased water. An actual physical water balance also records consumption, retained moisture and direct withdrawal/outfall as applicable; no residual volume is assigned automatically to wastewater or environmental release.

| requirement_id | applies_to | requirement | evidence |
| --- | --- | --- | --- |
| electricity | wholesale | Which supply point, AC/DC state, voltage and supplier dataset cover the meter record? Reconcile the listed AC row with any evidenced other supply; do not use the AC UUID for a different carrier. Record attributable metered handling, ambient-aeration, lighting, laboratory and office electricity, including unsuccessful handling and cleaning events; exclude overlapping provider-meter coverage. Range evidence need: Metered kWh by operation interval, actual aeration/handling hours, consignment residence and all-consumer attribution are needed. An empirical kWh guardrail needs independent comparable silo climate/load/quality evidence; missing generic Energy support and supplier identity remain separate gaps. Measurement evidence: protocol `cp_energy`; original record basis Energy / kWh. The original amount constraint “Actual attributed electricity per reference flow; cp_energy.” applies separately only to identity/unit-compatible individual rows; it creates no category-total exchange and does not assign the original unit to a different material or service. Do not normalize an already-per-reference quantity again. Defined flow cards: `electricity_ac`. Other actual states require the specific evidence decision above before any identity is assigned. This evidence record is not an exchange and cannot produce a category-total quantity. | `cp_energy`; actual source-linked native records |
| fuel_supply | wholesale | Which purchased fuel grade/formulation and supply gate are on the stock record? Identify any fuel other than the named diesel case and its native unit; obtain actual density before a volume-to-mass conversion. Expand the actual fuel grade and native supply unit; upstream supply follows actual stock-adjusted supply while direct combustion follows separately measured burn. No automatic full-tank combustion. Range evidence need: Use actual grade and native litres or mass, opening/receipts/closing and matched usable returns; any density/temperature conversion needs traceable basis. The supplied-to-burn relationship requires measured burn or complete disjoint fates, not a presumed combustion fraction. Measurement evidence: protocol `cp_supplies`; original record basis Volume / L. The original amount constraint “Actual attributed fuel supply per reference flow; cp_supplies.” applies separately only to identity/unit-compatible individual rows; it creates no category-total exchange and does not assign the original unit to a different material or service. Do not normalize an already-per-reference quantity again. Defined flow cards: `fuel_supply_diesel_supply`. Other actual states require the specific evidence decision above before any identity is assigned. This evidence record is not an exchange and cannot produce a category-total quantity. | `cp_supplies`; actual source-linked native records |
| water_supplied | wholesale | Does the supplier record establish treated tap water, or a different named water quality/source? Identify the supply state and gate; do not replace a non-tap-water supply with the tap-water card. Include actual purchased cleaning and sanitary water attributable to the operation. It is not grain moisture, environmental withdrawal or water-footprint output. Range evidence need: Retain actual metered purchased volume, cleaning/sanitary purpose, service period and supplier coverage. Any per-consignment water guardrail requires the same actual cleaning scope and allocation; it does not validate grain moisture or imply direct abstraction. Measurement evidence: protocol `cp_supplies`; original record basis Volume / m3. The original amount constraint “Actual attributed water supplied per reference flow; cp_supplies.” applies separately only to identity/unit-compatible individual rows; it creates no category-total exchange and does not assign the original unit to a different material or service. Do not normalize an already-per-reference quantity again. Defined flow cards: `water_supplied_liquid_tap`. Other actual states require the specific evidence decision above before any identity is assigned. This evidence record is not an exchange and cannot produce a category-total quantity. | `cp_supplies`; actual source-linked native records |
| operating_supplies | wholesale | Obtain the purchased SKU, formulation/SDS, supplied concentration, physical state, purpose and stock/issue records for the named cleaning or maintenance duty in this record. Identify the actual non-detergent material individually; do not prescribe a chemical, filter substrate or dose from this PCR. Expand only actual separately identified formulations, lubricants, filters and test consumables in native units; capture concentration and waste fate. No prescribed fumigant or application recipe. Range evidence need: Collect actual SKU, formulation and concentration, native unit, stock-adjusted consumption, usable returns and separately measured waste/release fates. A chemical-application or maintenance guardrail needs current actual route and product evidence; no generic fumigant dose or direct-release fraction is provided. Measurement evidence: protocol `cp_supplies`; original record basis Mass / kg. The original amount constraint “Actual attributed operating supplies per reference flow; cp_supplies.” applies separately only to identity/unit-compatible individual rows; it creates no category-total exchange and does not assign the original unit to a different material or service. Do not normalize an already-per-reference quantity again. Defined flow cards: `operating_supplies_synthetic_detergent`. Other actual states require the specific evidence decision above before any identity is assigned. This evidence record is not an exchange and cannot produce a category-total quantity. | `cp_supplies`; actual source-linked native records |
| packaging | wholesale | Obtain the package bill/specification, material or laminate identity and actual added-versus-inherited ownership. Determine each missing sleeve, seal, label, strap or support identity from that record; an integral composite is not several additive material exchanges. Normally bulk dispatch; include bags, seals or other actual single-use supplies only when used. Reusable bins and pallets belong in the asset or provider ledger. Range evidence need: Actual single-use SKU counts or mass and matching net merchandise quantity, package state and usable return evidence are needed. Bulk default does not prove zero packaging; reusable units require independently evidenced lifecycle service, not full new manufacture each dispatch. Measurement evidence: protocol `cp_supplies`; original record basis Mass / kg. The original amount constraint “Actual attributed packaging per reference flow; cp_supplies.” applies separately only to identity/unit-compatible individual rows; it creates no category-total exchange and does not assign the original unit to a different material or service. Do not normalize an already-per-reference quantity again. This evidence record is not an exchange and cannot produce a category-total quantity. | `cp_supplies`; actual source-linked native records |
| provider_services | wholesale | Obtain the provider contract/completed-result record for each named duty in this record, with native billed physical unit and included resources. Identify the individual service result; inspection, cleaning and handling are different services, and price/hours cannot be relabelled as Item(s). Expand actual laboratory, sanitation, pest-control, hired handling and administrative support results with provider-native quantity and full upstream scope. Item(s) is used only for a truly counted completed result, never hours or price converted to a count. Range evidence need: Verify each actual completed physical result, provider-native quantity and full upstream energy/material/asset/transport/treatment coverage; empirical guards need identical service scope and physical driver. Price, staff-hours or job count alone cannot fill absent provider burden. Measurement evidence: protocol `cp_providers`; original record basis Count / Item(s). The original amount constraint “Actual attributed provider services per reference flow; cp_providers.” applies separately only to identity/unit-compatible individual rows; it creates no category-total exchange and does not assign the original unit to a different material or service. Do not normalize an already-per-reference quantity again. This evidence record is not an exchange and cannot produce a category-total quantity. | `cp_providers`; actual source-linked native records |
| shared_assets | wholesale | For each explicitly named asset in this record, obtain the asset register identifier, configuration and matching complete-lifecycle dataset. The missing decision is the individual asset/service identity and lifetime all-user denominator; a warehouse, forklift and pallet cannot share one Count exchange or inherit a default life. Record attributable fractions of actual silo structures, conveyors, fans, scales, vehicles, instruments and ICT assets including manufacture, maintenance, replacements and end-of-life. Do not allocate merchandise as infrastructure. Range evidence need: Require actual asset configuration, complete manufacture/maintenance/replacement/end-of-life coverage and observed plus evidenced remaining lifetime driver across all consumers. Compare per-consignment asset fractions only at compatible utilization and holding profiles; no universal silo life or allocation fraction applies. Measurement evidence: protocol `cp_assets`; original record basis Count / Item(s). The original amount constraint “Actual attributed shared assets per reference flow; cp_assets.” applies separately only to identity/unit-compatible individual rows; it creates no category-total exchange and does not assign the original unit to a different material or service. Do not normalize an already-per-reference quantity again. This evidence record is not an exchange and cannot produce a category-total quantity. | `cp_assets`; actual source-linked native records |
| freight | wholesale | For each actual inbound, outbound, return and waste leg, obtain mode/vehicle, temperature service, origin/destination, actual load and distance plus provider coverage. The missing mode/configuration prevents selection of one freight identity; never collapse unlike modes into one kg*km flow. Expand each actual inbound, outbound, return and waste leg owned by the declared service scope; use net load and distance, and include empty-return treatment or disclosed provider coverage. Do not count an upstream delivered-price transport leg twice. Range evidence need: For each non-overlapping actual leg retain vehicle/mode, net load, load/distance units, actual route, empty-return basis and upstream scope. Any kg*km guardrail must preserve the same actual inbound/outbound/waste responsibility, consignment mass and route. Measurement evidence: protocol `cp_freight`; original record basis Mass*distance / kg*km. The original amount constraint “Actual attributed freight per reference flow; cp_freight.” applies separately only to identity/unit-compatible individual rows; it creates no category-total exchange and does not assign the original unit to a different material or service. Do not normalize an already-per-reference quantity again. This evidence record is not an exchange and cannot produce a category-total quantity. | `cp_freight`; actual source-linked native records |
| environmental_water | wholesale | Identify the actual abstraction point, water body/aquifer, location and measured source volume from intake permits/meter records. Surface water and groundwater require distinct source identities; no direct withdrawal is established by purchased water use. Expand actual water source, location and withdrawal role only if directly drawn. Purchased water is a different product input; no default direct withdrawal for an otherwise dry route. Range evidence need: Actual source, location, withdrawal volume meter, purpose and time are required if direct abstraction occurs. A missing meter or unknown source is unresolved coverage; no dry-wheat or purchased-water figure substitutes for actual direct abstraction. Measurement evidence: protocol `cp_environment`; original record basis Volume / m3. The original amount constraint “Actual attributed environmental water per reference flow; cp_environment.” applies separately only to identity/unit-compatible individual rows; it creates no category-total exchange and does not assign the original unit to a different material or service. Do not normalize an already-per-reference quantity again. This evidence record is not an exchange and cannot produce a category-total quantity. | `cp_environment`; actual source-linked native records |
| usable_returns | wholesale | Match the external return ticket to exactly one input SKU, state and native unit, and identify the receiver. Under consumed-only input accounting omit its matched return exchange; merchandise returns and closing inventory are separate audit records. Expand unused usable supply returns by the same SKU, native unit and state as their matched input. Closing stock is not an outward return; merchandise supplier/buyer returns stay in the separate grain ledger. Range evidence need: Require the same actual SKU/state/native-unit match, external recipient and physical transfer as the supply ledger. Any mass view needs measured per-item mass or actual state conversion and is non-additive; closing stock and discarded material are not usable return quantities. Measurement evidence: protocol `cp_supplies`; original record basis Mass / kg. The original amount constraint “Actual attributed usable returns per reference flow; cp_supplies.” applies separately only to identity/unit-compatible individual rows; it creates no category-total exchange and does not assign the original unit to a different material or service. Do not normalize an already-per-reference quantity again. Defined flow cards: `usable_returns_detergent_return`. Other actual states require the specific evidence decision above before any identity is assigned. This evidence record is not an exchange and cannot produce a category-total quantity. | `cp_supplies`; actual source-linked native records |
| waste_grain | wholesale | Obtain the independent transfer ticket for the actual outlet described in this record, including parent item/SKU, physical state, retained composition, receiver and treatment scope. Match it to one listed physical case; an unmatched part, fluid or contaminated mixture needs its own named identity, not this record ID as a waste flow. Record actual unusable spill, dust captured as waste and spoiled grain crossing to a documented waste receiver, with wet mass, moisture and dry-matter views. Captured dust is not an airborne emission. Rejecting a consignment is not proof that all its grain is waste. Range evidence need: Measure actual contained waste net mass and representative moisture, lot and receiving route; reconcile its dry matter against actual grain stock and linked lost-commodity demand. Do not impose historical FAO loss percentages, infer spoilage from water loss, or use captured dust as airborne-release quantity. Measurement evidence: protocol `cp_grain`; original record basis Mass / kg. The original amount constraint “Actual attributed waste grain per reference flow; cp_grain.” applies separately only to identity/unit-compatible individual rows; it creates no category-total exchange and does not assign the original unit to a different material or service. Do not normalize an already-per-reference quantity again. Defined flow cards: `waste_grain_atomic_case`; `waste_grain_captured_wheat_dust`. Other actual states require the specific evidence decision above before any identity is assigned. This evidence record is not an exchange and cannot produce a category-total quantity. | `cp_grain`; actual source-linked native records |
| other_wastes | wholesale | Obtain the independent transfer ticket for the actual outlet described in this record, including parent item/SKU, physical state, retained composition, receiver and treatment scope. Match it to one listed physical case; an unmatched part, fluid or contaminated mixture needs its own named identity, not this record ID as a waste flow. Expand actual packaging waste, spent filters, oils, laboratory and cleaning wastes separately by composition, native unit and receiving route. Treatment burdens must have one owner and explicit inclusion coverage. Range evidence need: Each actual waste fraction requires composition/state, native measured amount, receiver and treatment coverage. Any per-consignment guardrail must use the actual single-use/maintenance scope; container mass, treatment invoice or safety classification alone is not actual waste composition or treatment load. Measurement evidence: protocol `cp_environment`; original record basis Mass / kg. The original amount constraint “Actual attributed other wastes per reference flow; cp_environment.” applies separately only to identity/unit-compatible individual rows; it creates no category-total exchange and does not assign the original unit to a different material or service. Do not normalize an already-per-reference quantity again. This evidence record is not an exchange and cannot produce a category-total quantity. | `cp_environment`; actual source-linked native records |
| contained_wastewater | wholesale | Obtain the independent transfer ticket for the actual outlet described in this record, including parent item/SKU, physical state, retained composition, receiver and treatment scope. Match it to one listed physical case; an unmatched part, fluid or contaminated mixture needs its own named identity, not this record ID as a waste flow. Record actual collected cleaning, sanitary or other aqueous wastewater transferred to a documented receiving treatment system. Measure native received volume and actual composition; it is not a direct environmental outfall and is not inferred from purchased water volume. Identify whether provider treatment is included in this evidence checkpoint or another upstream service, with one burden owner. Range evidence need: Obtain actual collected or received wastewater volume, collection interval, aqueous state and contaminant composition/concentration basis, receiver and treatment coverage. Do not set wastewater equal to water purchased or count a separate direct outfall for the same transfer. A quantitative guardrail requires independent comparable actual cleaning/sanitary scope and unit basis. Measurement evidence: protocol `cp_environment`; original record basis Volume / m3. The original amount constraint “Actual attributed contained wastewater per reference flow; cp_environment.” applies separately only to identity/unit-compatible individual rows; it creates no category-total exchange and does not assign the original unit to a different material or service. Do not normalize an already-per-reference quantity again. Defined flow cards: `contained_wastewater_aqueous_cleaning`. Other actual states require the specific evidence decision above before any identity is assigned. This evidence record is not an exchange and cannot produce a category-total quantity. | `cp_environment`; actual source-linked native records |
| water_outfalls | wholesale | Identify the direct outfall and receiving water/soil compartment, measured water amount and independently analysed pollutant species. A sewer transfer to treatment is not this outfall; the missing receiving compartment prevents a concrete elementary-flow selection. Expand only actual direct outfalls by receiving medium and quality. Wastewater sent in containment to treatment is Waste, not an elementary outfall; separately quantified pollutants must not double count carrier water. Range evidence need: Actual direct outfall volume and receiving medium, sampling interval, measured composition and treatment responsibility are needed. Do not infer pollutant mass from purchased water, sum carrier volume and pollutant mass as one flow, or treat containerized wastewater as direct discharge. Measurement evidence: protocol `cp_environment`; original record basis Volume / m3. The original amount constraint “Actual attributed water outfalls per reference flow; cp_environment.” applies separately only to identity/unit-compatible individual rows; it creates no category-total exchange and does not assign the original unit to a different material or service. Do not normalize an already-per-reference quantity again. This evidence record is not an exchange and cannot produce a category-total quantity. | `cp_environment`; actual source-linked native records |
| species_releases | wholesale | Identify each measured release at its source/event, chemical or particle-size identity, origin and receiving compartment using the emission/sampling record. Unknown species, unresolved particle fraction or unknown medium must remain a specific evidence gap; neither total chemical use nor stock loss supplies that identity. Expand actual combustion, uncontained grain dust, refrigerant or pest-control emissions only for identified species or particle fraction and medium. Use actual measurement or compatible species-specific factors and activity, never total supply, missing stock or a safety-limit value as an emission. Range evidence need: For each actual identified species or particle fraction and medium retain measured release or compatible measured activity and species factor, with composition/fate basis and sources if applicable. Dry-matter stock residual, dust captured as waste, safety limits or total formulated supply cannot establish a species release; complete factors are applied once. Measurement evidence: protocol `cp_environment`; original record basis Mass / kg. The original amount constraint “Actual attributed species releases per reference flow; cp_environment.” applies separately only to identity/unit-compatible individual rows; it creates no category-total exchange and does not assign the original unit to a different material or service. Do not normalize an already-per-reference quantity again. Defined flow cards: `species_releases_co2_fossil_air`; `species_releases_methane_fossil_air`; `species_releases_nitrous_oxide_air`. Other actual states require the specific evidence decision above before any identity is assigned. This evidence record is not an exchange and cannot produce a category-total quantity. | `cp_environment`; actual source-linked native records |


## 9. Validation Rules

| rule_id | applies_to | rule | source_ids |
| --- | --- | --- | --- |
| validate_reference | accepted_service | Confirm actual own-account B2B resale, unique accepted consignment, N > 0, actual mass/moisture/quality/storage time and agreed gate. Rejected/cancelled output is excluded and invoice splits cannot inflate count. |  |
| validate_grain | grain memorandum | Reconcile all grain dry-matter and water states, actual usable returns, downgrades, waste and independently identified loss; do not convert unexplained residual to an elementary emission. Record linked commodity production-only loss adjustment and its coverage once before complete-chain claims. |  |
| validate_coverage | all inventory rows | Every actual exchange has native unit, node-owned protocol and quantity/fate evidence. Expand actual provider, supply, waste and species umbrellas; missing coverage cannot be assumed absent. Direct/provider and commodity/service boundaries must not overlap. |  |
| validate_assets_periods | shared_assets | Check all asset consumers and lifecycle phases, observed plus evidenced remaining driver, maintenance/replacement/end-of-life, period linkage, idle treatment, uncertainty and one attribution view. An unsupported lifetime is a data gap. |  |
| validate_species | species_releases; species_releases_co2_fossil_air; species_releases_methane_fossil_air; species_releases_nitrous_oxide_air | Verify actual species/particle fraction, receiving medium, compatible activity and factor/composition/fate sources. Captured dust or container contents are not direct emissions; measured fuel supply is not burn; no duplication of carrier-water and species views. |  |
| validate_reject_mode | wholesale | Link each batch/campaign/period, failed attempt, cleaning/changeover, reject return and disposal to the originating lot and one owner. Internal transfers and grain returns must reconcile stock and cancellation without creating new production or multiple accepted service counts. |  |
| validate_concrete_identity_decisions | all inventory rows | Resolve each actual identity evidence decision to a physically specific card and native quantity or evidenced non-applicability. Evidence-checkpoint IDs are not exchanges. Missing occurrence, species, state, receiver or provider configuration blocks final data completion; no assumed zero. Whole streams and components, gross inputs and matched returns must remain mutually exclusive where required. |  |
