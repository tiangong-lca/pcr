# Farmed live whole sea-cage Japanese amberjack

## 1. Scope and Applicability

Applies to Japanese sea-cage Japanese amberjack (Seriola quinqueradiata), beginning with purchased wild-origin nursed juveniles and ending with the selected live harvest, sorting, holding and delivery channel. The sole reference product is whole living fish accepted by the first farmer physical recipient before slaughter. This is a specific production and delivery route with partial coverage of CPC 04262.

Excludes other Seriola, wild adult capture, hatchery-origin juveniles, wholly land-based farming, and dead, iced-dead, gutted, filleted or frozen reference products. The slaughter, bleeding and icing route described by FAO does not replace this live gate.

Declare every required qualifier in data package metadata, process notes, reference-flow comments, product description or equivalent fields.

## 4. Measurement and Unit Rules

| rule_id | Applies to | Required property | Required unit | Rule |
| --- | --- | --- | --- | --- |
| reference_mass | reference product | Mass `93a60a56-a3c8-11da-a746-0800200b9a66` | kg | Obtain accepted net whole live fish mass A by calibrated weighing or traceable weighing records, excluding free carrier water, containers and all tare; use cp_deliver. The same A is every node’s per 1 kg reference flow denominator. |
| count_mass | live fish and juveniles | Mass `93a60a56-a3c8-11da-a746-0800200b9a66` | kg | Count is not mass. Retain raw lot counts and independent representative body-mass samples with uncertainty; multiply the applicable count by actual sampled mean body mass, never a universal fish weight. |
| feed_basis | collect_grow_feed | Mass `93a60a56-a3c8-11da-a746-0800200b9a66` | kg | Keep actual as-fed mass, moisture and dry-matter conversion evidence separately; raw fish, moist feed and formulated feed have no shared fixed FCR or default share. |
| native_units | service and environmental instances | Actual instance property | native unit | Preserve kWh, MJ, L, m3, t km, equipment hours or supplier service units; convert only with metering, density, heating value or service-boundary evidence. Declare formulated medicine versus active ingredient, nutrient species versus elemental mass, and respiration versus fossil carbon separately; do not invent a mass identity for an unknown unit. |

## 5. System Boundary

### Boundary Abstraction

| Field | Value |
| --- | --- |
| declared_starting_condition | Physical farm receipt of purchased wild-origin nursed Japanese amberjack juveniles |
| starting_condition_role | Purchased biological production input carrying complete upstream collection and nursery burdens |
| product_classification_scope | Narrower species, seed-origin, cage and live-gate scope within CPC 3.0 04262 |
| recursive_input_rule | For same-category purchased or returned live fish, declare predecessor gate, cohort, transfer id and carried burden; purchased additions require upstream data, without recursive duplicate generation or classifying internal returns as new seed. |
| upstream_dataset_requirement | Upstream data matching species, wild collection/nursery, supplier period/geography, feed, energy, mortality and transport boundary; complete and disclose missing activities |
| disclosure | Disclose actual start/end, live channel, supplier and ownership boundaries, all phases/periods, internal transfers, losses, shared assets and service inclusions |

### Boundary Rules

| rule_id | Applies to | Rule | source_ids |
| --- | --- | --- | --- |
| boundary_route | route | Include purchased wild-origin nursed juveniles, managed sea-cage growout, separate live harvest, sorting, and preservation/delivery to the selected live receipt. Exclude hatchery-origin seed, wild adult capture, other Seriola and all slaughter or dead-product processing. | `fao-japanese-amberjack-2009` |
| boundary_seed | grow_juveniles | Purchased juveniles carry complete wild collection, nursery, feed, energy and inbound transport burdens to the declared farm receipt. They are neither burden-free wild seed nor a duplicate foreground hatchery; document supplier boundaries and any missing upstream activity. | `fao-japanese-amberjack-2009` |
| boundary_gate | amberjack_live_accepted | End at the first farmer physical recipient accepting the fish alive before slaughter. Dispatch, invoice ownership, live arrival and physical acceptance are different events; use the declared actual acceptance. Later wholesale holding, slaughter, bleeding, icing and retail are excluded unless they occur before this declared gate, in which case a dead state falls outside this PCR. | `fao-japanese-amberjack-2009` |
| boundary_period | cohorts | Declare stocking, cage transfers, harvest, sorting, holding, delivery and acceptance phases across each calendar reporting period. Opening/closing live stocks and return transfers carry their attributable burdens once; failed cycles, idle care, mortality disposal, net changes and termination events remain accounted for. | `accepted-live-mass-accounting` |
| boundary_owner | all nodes | For every craft, cage, tank, vehicle and support service, identify its actual consuming nodes and periods and one owner. Select provider-inclusive or direct fuel/power/emissions/capital accounting for each component without overlap. No independent primary conditioning or product packaging operation is presumed for the live tank channel. | `accepted-live-mass-accounting` |

| sort | Live grade and destination sorting | required | selected route | Incoming harvested live fish are classified as live-channel eligible, other intended live outputs, live returns, or collected waste. Record actual grades and each destination; a low grade is not automatically waste. | per 1 kg reference flow |
| deliver | Live holding and delivery | required | selected route | Maintain sorted living fish in actual tank and transport conditions until first farmer physical recipient acceptance before slaughter. Tank life support and delivery are a bounded preservation responsibility; no universal survival duration, temperature or food-safety guarantee is asserted. | per 1 kg reference flow |

Production is cohort-managed biological growth with possible partial harvests, indexed by calendar periods and actual lots/runs/net-change/cleaning/changeover events; do not assume one annual batch. Every card below uses the same accepted-mass denominator while internal transfers retain actual measured quantities. Declare service-inclusive versus direct inventory alternatives component by component; no unowned common pool of cross-node services.

### Process: Sea-cage growout (`grow`)

Purchased wild-origin nursed juveniles enter managed cage cohorts; live biomass is handed to harvest. Feed, husbandry, net exchange and equipment cleaning belong here.

## 7. Allocation and Co-product Handling

| rule_id | Applies to | Rule | source_ids |
| --- | --- | --- | --- |
| allocation_outputs | intended outputs | Enumerate all actual intended live grade/destination outputs and handoffs, including side sales outside the reference channel. Subdivide independently metered operations first; allocate remaining joint growout/harvest/sort/preservation burdens to intended live outputs by accepted net live mass at their own gate, using a documented output ledger and period linkage. If a different causal relation is evidenced, obtain a reviewed explicit replacement before finalization; disclose sensitivity. | `accepted-live-mass-accounting` |
| allocation_returns | internal transfers | Internal cage, harvest, sorting and holding transfers, live returns and period carryover are linked stock movements, not independent final outputs. Transfer their existing burden without allocating it again; split partial harvests using cohort/period activity records. Biological growth means juvenile input mass need not equal harvested output mass. | `accepted-live-mass-accounting` |
| allocation_losses | loss and waste | Mortality, escaped fish, incidental organisms and actual waste are not automatic co-products. Keep attributable loss, failed-cycle and treatment burdens with accountable production; grant no fish-stock, nutrient-removal or carbon credit without a separately reviewed method and evidence. | `accepted-live-mass-accounting` |
| allocation_shared | shared assets and periods | Enumerate actual shared cage/net/mooring/craft/tank/vehicle consumers and periods. Attribute direct usage by meters or logged operating/occupancy time, with attributable capacity only when documented; record asset installation, repair, replacement and termination over actual evidenced service, no default lifetime. The sum of shares equals the recorded burden once, including idle/nonproductive service; disclose unresolved replacement or service evidence. | `accepted-live-mass-accounting` |

## 9. Validation Rules

| rule_id | Applies to | Rule | source_ids |
| --- | --- | --- | --- |
| validate_identity | reference | Verify species, Japanese sea-cage route, wild-origin purchased nursed seed, complete whole-body live state, actual pre-slaughter first physical recipient gate and all qualifiers. Reference link must name amberjack_live_accepted, whose accepted mass is the same denominator in all nodes. | `accepted-live-mass-accounting` |
| validate_records | all inventory rows | Require node-owned collection protocols and complete raw records, calibration, transferred lot ids, stock terms and native unit conversions. Reconcile count ledgers including opening/closing stocks, inputs, harvests, returns, deaths, escapes and intended outputs; reconcile growth/feed and uncertainty separately rather than forcing mass equality. | `accepted-live-mass-accounting` |
| validate_emissions | environmental exchanges | Check substance/species, receiving medium, nutrient or active-ingredient basis and actual direct ownership. Distinguish biological ledger states, collected waste, treated wastewater and direct releases; reject duplicate whole-organic and constituent accounting or fossil attribution to respiration. | `accepted-live-mass-accounting` |
| validate_attribution | cohorts and services | Check all intended grade handoffs, failed cycles, idle support, partial harvest and period carryover; shared consumers and shares must be complete and exclusive. Unresolved causal allocation, asset replacement or termination evidence blocks finalization. | `accepted-live-mass-accounting` |
| validate_ranges | all inventory rows | Every 0..U_row or U_instance range is an unresolved evidence need, never a measured or sourced estimate. Establish each upper bound independently from applicable external evidence or independently approved historical reference records, and review its scope before use. Do not validate the measured batch with its own maximum, substitute zero for missing evidence, or aggregate unlike native units. | `accepted-live-mass-accounting` |
| validate_bindings | downstream publication | Resolve each actual product, waste, elementary and service exchange to a compatible verified identity and support property/unit before final downstream exchange publication. Candidate projection/check success does not establish identity verification, empirical range support or publication readiness. | `accepted-live-mass-accounting` |
| `validate_atomic_completion` | all applicable collection requirements and concrete inventory exchanges | Resolve every applicable section-8 collection requirement into individual physical/chemical exchanges with their own quantities, native units, composition/state, range basis or explicit uncertainty evidence, raw records, normalization, actual destinations/receiving media and verified compatible UUIDs. Any unresolved applicable requirement makes the final dataset incomplete and validation fails; unknown is not zero. Never copy aggregate amounts onto components or duplicate inclusive services with owned fuel/electricity/direct releases. Internal transfers are not fixed to the final 1 kg. | |
