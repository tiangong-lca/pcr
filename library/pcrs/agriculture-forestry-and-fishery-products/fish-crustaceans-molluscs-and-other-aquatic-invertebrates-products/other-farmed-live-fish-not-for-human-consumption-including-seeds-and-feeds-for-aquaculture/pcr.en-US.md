# Farmed live fish for aquaculture seed, broodstock or feed

## 1. Scope and Applicability

Apply to viable live fish with documented managed-production origin handed over at the first producer gate for aquaculture seed, broodstock or live-fish feed. Each data package declares one purpose and its actual species, cohort and stage. Hatched larvae or fry may be final seed without reaching food market size. Eggs/gametes can be upstream inputs but are not the final reference fish.

Exclude ornamental fish, directly human-food fish, wild fish merely held temporarily without managed production, research-only or recreational-bait purposes, dead feed, fishmeal/oil, non-fish seed/feed organisms, frozen or other processed fish. This semantic boundary is narrower than all nonfood farmed live fish under CPC 04192. The UN classification supports the purpose/origin distinction; the measurement, ledger and boundary details here are this PCR's internal method, not universal historical husbandry or medicine prescriptions.

| representative_product | Qualified viable cohort of actual specified species and life stage at producer handover |
| production_route | Owned reproduction/hatchery or actual purchased upstream stage → post-hatch managed rearing only when performed → independent collection from the last actual owned production node → actual bounded live holding → live presentation and handover; suitable seed may pass directly from hatchery to collection without fictitious rearing; spawning parent broodstock_hatch; water-system parent managed_rearing |
| market_state | Viable live at handover, net wet biomass excluding carrier water, oxygen, packaging and nonqualifying dead fish |

## 3. Reference Flow

| Field | Value |
| --- | --- |
| What | Farmed viable live fish of declared aquaculture purpose, species and stage at producer handover |
| How much | 1 kg net viable wet fish biomass; actual count and representative individual mass accompany it |
| How well | Seed: declared stocking stage and health/fitness; broodstock: actual sex, maturity and reproductive fitness; live-fish feed: actual recipient cultured organism and feed suitability; kilograms alone do not establish equivalence |
| How long or cycle | Complete actual cohort cycle and handover period, including applicable parent establishment, repeated spawning cycles, replacement/retirement and opening/closing burden carryover |
| reference_flow_link | `aquaculture_live_handover` |

| Reference product flow | Farmed live fish for declared aquaculture purpose at producer handover |
| Reference flow property | Mass `93a60a56-a3c8-11da-a746-0800200b9a66` |
| Reference unit group | Units of mass `93a60a57-a4c8-11da-a746-0800200c9a66` |
| Reference unit | kg |
| Required qualifiers | species and cohort; farmed origin and owned/purchased stages; one seed/broodstock/live-fish-feed purpose; life stage and individual size; viability and health/fitness; parent sex/maturity or feed recipient suitability; net wet mass and actual count/sampling; actual water system and salinity/temperature; cycle/period and parent carryover; actual first producer gate and holding/packing route |

Declare these qualifiers in foreground metadata or the corresponding product, reference-flow and process descriptions; missing qualifiers make the reference definition incomplete. Carrier-water volume, egg count or a universal fish-per-kilogram factor cannot substitute for actual cohort wet-mass measurement.

## 4. Measurement and Unit Rules

| rule_id | Applies to | Required property | Required unit | Rule |
| --- | --- | --- | --- | --- |
| `reference_net_mass` | reference product | Mass `93a60a56-a3c8-11da-a746-0800200b9a66` | kg | Use calibrated qualified viable net wet fish mass per 1 kg reference flow, excluding water, gas, packaging, dead and rejected fish; collect with cp_handover. |
| `actual_count_mass` | all fish transfers | Mass | kg | Count-to-mass requires actual representative sample mass/count for the same species, stage and period with sampling uncertainty; no generic fish-count or egg-count factor. |
| `water_feed_gas_basis` | water; feeds; oxygen | Mass | kg | Volume-to-mass needs actual density and temperature/salinity or gas pressure/temperature/purity; wet/dry feed conversion needs measured moisture; circulation and internal fish transfers retain actual quantities. |
| `energy_units` | electricity; heat | Net calorific value | MJ | 1 kWh = 3.6 MJ; retain original measured units and conversion, do not treat electricity/heat as fuel mass or services as kilograms. |

## 5. System Boundary

### Boundary Abstraction

| Field | Value |
| --- | --- |
| declared_starting_condition | Actual parent establishment or purchased eggs, larvae, fry or other upstream fish stage, with real origin and corresponding upstream-data interface |
| starting_condition_role | Evidenced stage boundary, never a zero-burden starting point |
| product_classification_scope | Narrower aquaculture seed, broodstock or live-fish-feed subset of CPC 04192; final fish must be hatched and viable |
| recursive_input_rule | For same-category purchased fish record actual stage, origin, quantity and supplier dataset reference; model upstream separately to avoid infinite recursion and duplicate owned stages without deleting real upstream burden |
| upstream_dataset_requirement | Supplier data must match species, stage, purpose, site/geography, period, technology and attribution; disclose and remedy gaps, never default to free input |
| disclosure | All owned/purchased stages, actual life stage, spawning/water-system parent deltas, cohort periods/carryover, shared consumers, viable holding/packing and first producer handover |

| rule_id | Applies to | Rule | source_ids |
| --- | --- | --- | --- |
| `b_origin` | product_scope | Require documented managed production and one aquaculture purpose/life-stage cohort; mere live holding of wild fish remains outside this farmed PCR. | `un-cpc-3-2025`; `pcr-live-aquaculture-method` |
| `b_owned_purchased` | broodstock_hatch; managed_rearing | Identify every owned/purchased stage and upstream origin. A purchased stage replaces its actual upstream activities with a compatible supplier dataset; it never removes their burdens or duplicates owned reproduction. | `fao-seed-production`; `pcr-live-aquaculture-method` |
| `b_phase_end` | broodstock_hatch; managed_rearing | End actual managed production at the declared suitable live stage. When no separate post-hatch rearing occurs and seed stage/fitness is evidenced, larvae/fry pass directly from hatchery to collection without mandatory rearing, nursery or growout. Require actual owned hatchery or rearing production; merely purchasing finished fish for trading or holding is not this production route. Retain all hatchery burdens; broodstock requires actual maturity/fitness and feed fish actual recipient/use suitability. | `pcr-live-aquaculture-method` |
| `b_deltas` | broodstock_hatch; managed_rearing | Spawning alternatives attach to broodstock_hatch; water-system alternatives attach to managed_rearing. Current event records and site topology must demonstrate changed resource, calculation and verification categories. Do not add duplicate biological outputs for alternative labels. | `fao-seed-production`; `ifas-ras-health`; `pcr-live-aquaculture-method` |
| `b_responsibility` | harvest; holding; presentation | Collection independently removes the selected cohort from production. Any bounded holding maintains the actual usable live state; presentation protects and hands over that same live fish. Preserve each internal mass/count and source cohort; omit a conditional node only with actual non-use evidence. | `fao-live-fish-handling`; `pcr-live-aquaculture-method` |
| `b_complete` | all selected nodes | Include actual feed, fertilisation, reproduction/health materials, water, pumping/aeration/light electricity, heat, fuel, oxygen, chemicals, packaging and losses. Central utilities/residuals records retain originating stage, run and period; no selected stage becomes resource-free. | `pcr-live-aquaculture-method` |
| `b_period_assets` | broodstock_hatch; utilities | Enumerate parent establishment, each spawning cycle, replacement/retirement, fish cohort phases, opening/closing stock, asset service periods and consumers. Carry attributable burdens forward with standing stock and reconcile terminal fates; disclose any asset cut-off and sensitivity. | `pcr-live-aquaculture-method` |
| `b_gate` | presentation | Include actual owned packing/loading and own transport only to the explicitly declared first producer handover. Exclude subsequent recipient transport, stocking, growout, feeding/use and downstream packaging fate; disclose supplier and treatment boundary interfaces. | `pcr-live-aquaculture-method` |
| `b_streams` | residuals | Classify each source-stage mortality, escaped fish, nonviable egg, culture waste, solids, treatment sludge, effluent, chemical and refrigerant event. Separate external treatment handoff from direct environmental release and retain upstream loss burdens; no unobserved zero or automatic avoided credit. | `pcr-live-aquaculture-method` |

## 6. Process Inventory Structure

Declare batch, campaign or continuous mode, run/period, cleaning/changeover and actual outputs for every selected node. Central utility/residual ledgers attribute each resource/event once by source stage; node prose/material cards must not add the same exchange twice. External services and shared asset activity retain true units in cp_service_utilities; cp_service_presentation/cp_shared_utilities and become concrete service exchanges only after verification.

### Process Map

| process_id | process_name | inclusion | inclusion_condition | role | quantitative_reference |
| --- | --- | --- | --- | --- | --- |
| `broodstock_hatch` | Owned broodstock and hatchery | `conditional` | Owned broodstock maintenance, spawning or egg incubation is performed | managed biological production | actual eggs or hatched fish and retained broodstock |
| `live_feed` | Owned live-food cultivation | `conditional` | Algae, rotifers, Artemia or other live-food organisms are cultivated on site | supporting biological production | actual edible live-food biomass transferred to fish stages |
| `managed_rearing` | Selected managed fish rearing | `conditional` | Separate post-hatch larval, fry, nursery or later rearing actually occurs; missing records do not justify omission, and actual hatchery-only seed does not create this phase | managed biological production | actual live cohort ready for harvest at the declared life stage |
| `harvest` | Live cohort collection | `required` | Collection from the last actual owned production node: managed_rearing when performed, or directly broodstock_hatch for actual hatchery-only seed | independent harvest | actual collected viable fish handed to holding or presentation |
| `holding` | Bounded live holding and acclimation | `conditional` | Collected fish undergo an actual pre-handover viability-maintenance intervention | preservation stabilization | actual viable fish after bounded holding |
| `presentation` | Live presentation and producer handover | `required` | First producer handover, including packaging/loading only when performed | packaging and presentation | qualifying live fish at producer handover |
| `utilities` | Stage-linked utilities and direct releases | `required` | Record actual resources for every selected foreground node | shared utility ledger | resources attributed once to each actual consuming node |
| `residuals` | Stage-linked effluent and residual management | `conditional` | Any actual effluent, mortality, solids, escape, leakage or treatment event occurs | residual fate and treatment | actual treatment handoffs or direct environmental releases |

### Process: Owned broodstock and hatchery (`broodstock_hatch`)

Broodstock identity, sex and maturity, each spawning event, incubation and hatching are linked to the offspring cohort. Natural spawning, environmentally induced spawning and assisted/artificial fertilization are alternatives under this managed-production parent; actual treatment, handling, water/thermal/light changes and gamete collection define the delta. Use one method per event; different documented events may coexist. Purchased fertilized eggs bypass owned spawning, while purchased fry bypass the corresponding owned hatchery stages. Eggs and gametes are counted and measured at transfer and never become the final live-fish reference. Retained parent stock is standing stock, not an extra sale.

###### Hatched live fish to rearing or direct collection (`hatched_fish_transfer`)

Record actual surviving hatched larval/fry mass and count; link by event to actual rearing intake, or harvest_stock_input for actual hatchery-only seed. Retain preceding failed-egg and hatch-loss burdens; the same fish do not enter both paths.

### Process: Owned live-food cultivation (`live_feed`)

This is the food-organism culture boundary, separate from the fish sold as live feed. Identify each culture species, inoculum/cysts, food and enrichment, fertiliser, salinity media, cleaning, aeration, heating and lighting. Utilities and water cross the utility ledger once with live_feed as consumer. Harvested feed transfer has actual wet/dry matter and count/concentration as applicable; discarded cultures, cyst shells and culture water have recorded fates. Purchased live food replaces the corresponding owned culture with supplier burden, never a free culture output.

### Process: Selected managed fish rearing (`managed_rearing`)

Include this node only for actual separate post-hatch rearing; qualified hatchery-only seed may go directly to collection, but missing records do not establish phase absence. Declare each actual phase; a larval/fry seed gate can end before nursery or growout. The parent is managed_rearing: pond culture changes fertilisation, sediment and drainage records; flow-through changes abstraction/discharge throughput; tank/RAS changes recirculation, make-up, filtration, backwash, aeration and energy records. Choose actual topology per phase and system; phases with different verified systems can coexist, mutually exclusive labels cannot describe the same water loop. Current site diagrams and meters establish these deltas, not a species-wide technology assumption. Record natural pond food as an ecological contribution, with actual fertilisation burdens; do not invent purchased feed for it. Wild-derived inputs qualify for farmed final origin only after documented managed production, not temporary holding.

### Process: Live cohort collection (`harvest`)

Collection ends the last actual owned production phase: receive reared_live_transfer when rearing occurs, or directly hatched_fish_transfer for actual hatchery-only seed. It establishes recoverable fish, returned standing stock, mortality and incidental material. This independent responsibility records netting, pumping, crowding and transfer losses separately from biological growth and later acclimation; it creates no additional growth. Source pond/tank, cohort and collection time persist through pooling. Actual harvested mass is an internal transfer, not the fixed final kilogram.

### Process: Bounded live holding and acclimation (`holding`)

Define start/end times and before/after viable state, actual water, oxygen, salinity, temperature, fasting or feed and health intervention. Holding preserves the declared usable live stage; substantial production belongs in managed_rearing. Include measured mortality, rejection, maintenance feed, water replacement and thermal-control releases. No killing or chilling-to-death is a live preservation option. Provider health/holding activity is retained in its true service unit in the auxiliary service ledger.

### Process: Live presentation and producer handover (`presentation`)

Receive actual live fish from harvest or holding; declare unpackaged tank handover or actual bag/container packing. Record containment, liners, boxes, labels, loading and reusable-container allocation, with separate packaging/water/gas quantities. Maintain viability and intended aquaculture purpose through acceptance. Packaging protects the same live fish and never adds to reference biomass. Own transport occurs here only when the declared first producer gate actually includes it, with route and responsibility documented; recipient transport, stocking and use after that gate are outside.

### Process: Stage-linked utilities and direct releases (`utilities`)

This ledger owns supplied water, own abstraction, electricity, fuels, oxygen, heat and direct utility emissions for all selected processes. Record source-stage, water loop, meter, run and period for every quantity, including broodstock, hatchery, live-food culture, rearing, harvest, holding, presentation and own treatment. Shared pumps, blower, filters, UV, chiller, heating and backup generator have a consumer/period matrix. Internal recirculation is measured auxiliary activity, not another external water input. Same source material at different stages is metered or attributed once and never silently duplicated.

###### Externally supplied treated process water suitable for actual fish use (`supplied_treated_water`)

Only documented externally supplied treated industrial process water, with fish-contact/use suitability. No seawater, own abstraction, internal circulation or effluent; supplier treatment included upstream is not repeated.

This is one actual externally supplied water exchange, not an assumed industrial process-water supply. Retain its measured quantity and actual source, treatment, grade, salinity and use. Verify fitness for the actual animal-contact, carrier, washing or ice-making purpose and resolve the exact actual supply identity independently before dataset completion; no industrial-water UUID is inherited.

###### CN grid-average AC below 1 kV consumption mix to user (`cn_low_voltage_electricity`)

Use only documented compatible CN grid-average low-voltage consumption; allocate metered electricity once to actual stage, run and period.

Conditional identity: this binding applies only to actual purchased Chinese grid-average consumption-mix alternating current below 1 kV delivered to this node. Verify geography, voltage, supplier/mix and actual consumption; other regions, voltages, contracted mixes or own generation require independent identities and records. No supply or use is assumed.

### Process: Stage-linked effluent and residual management (`residuals`)

Keep source-stage event records for every selected node even when treatment is centralized. Each discharge is either a waste handoff to a named external treatment or an actual release to a declared environment after any owned treatment; never both for the same stream. Own treatment inputs, sludge, reject/backwash and measured final releases are included, with utilities assigned here once. Record mortalities, nonviable eggs, retired broodstock fate, escapes and leaks without default zero. Classify intentional saleable outputs separately; disposal and an alleged avoided-burden credit cannot erase their upstream burdens.

## 7. Allocation and Co-product Handling

| rule_id | Applies to | Rule | source_ids |
| --- | --- | --- | --- |
| `a_precedence` | common production burdens | Subdivide independently measured activities first, then apply an evidenced causal physical relationship to remaining common burdens. Document economic allocation at the common handover only if physical causality cannot be established, with price period, all output values and sensitivity. Wet mass alone is not presumed causal across seeds, broodstock and feed fish. | `ghg-product-standard-2011`; `pcr-live-aquaculture-method` |
| `a_output_set` | hatchery_other_products; rearing_other_products | Enumerate every intended saleable species/cohort/life stage/purpose, its measured quantity and own handover. Classify unsold residue, mortality, waste and retained stock separately. Assign each common burden once; an internal transfer is never another sale. | `pcr-live-aquaculture-method` |
| `a_modes` | all selected nodes | Declare cohort batch, repeated spawning campaign or continuous/overlapping flow mode with run/period start and end. Link feed, utilities, outputs, cleaning and changeover events to the applicable run; allocate common idle/changeover burdens across actual beneficiaries with documented causal activity. | `pcr-live-aquaculture-method` |
| `a_parents_periods` | broodstock_hatch | Track parent acquisition/establishment and maintenance across spawning cycles; allocate actual parent-service burden to offspring events using evidenced reproductive contribution or another justified causal relation. Reconcile opening/closing parent stock, replacements, mortality and terminal sale/disposal, including residual unassigned burden on retirement. Do not charge full parent establishment anew to every spawn. | `pcr-live-aquaculture-method` |
| `a_cohort_carryover` | managed_rearing; holding | Keep opening burden plus actual current inputs attached to the cohort. Reconcile surviving closing stock, qualified handovers, internal transfers, mortality/rejection and escapes by phase. Carry closing stock and its burden into the next period; retain losses in surviving product burdens without crediting dead fish as equivalent live output. | `pcr-live-aquaculture-method` |
| `a_shared` | utilities; residuals; presentation | For each shared water loop, pump, blower, thermal system, filter, hatchery room or reusable container, enumerate actual consuming nodes/cohorts and periods. Use submeters first, then measured power-time, treated throughput, occupancy-time or another evidenced driver matched to the asset. Reconcile total shares to the asset ledger and account for maintenance/replacement and realized reuse once. | `pcr-live-aquaculture-method` |
| `a_services` | cp_service_utilities; cp_service_presentation; cp_shared_utilities | Retain diagnostic tests, holding services and within-gate transport in actual test, fish-day, tonne-kilometre or provider activity units with property/unit verification before exchange binding. Unknown service identities stay auxiliary evidence and unresolved metadata; never invent kg of generic service. | `pcr-live-aquaculture-method` |
| `a_fates` | residuals | Keep treatment and collection burdens of mortality, failed eggs, waste and effluent within the product system. Report any distinct substitution scenario separately with evidence; do not deduct an unverified avoided product or dilute losses with transport water/packaging mass. | `pcr-live-aquaculture-method` |

### Calculation Rules

| rule_id | Applies to | Formula or rule | Inputs | Output | source_ids |
| --- | --- | --- | --- | --- | --- |
| `cohort_inventory` | all inventory rows | Divide actual attributable quantity by net viable wet mass of the same qualifying handover cohort; final reference fish is fixed at 1 kg, internal transfers retain measured amounts; carry undelivered closing stock/burden forward and do not repeat it across handovers. | cp_handover; cp_stock_broodstock_hatch; cp_stock_managed_rearing; cp_stock_harvest; cp_stock_holding; cp_stock_presentation; actual stage ledgers | actual inventory per 1 kg reference flow | `pcr-live-aquaculture-method` |
| `sample_biomass` | actual fish count records | Divide actual representative sample wet mass by sampled count and multiply actual qualifying count of the same cohort; document stratification, stage and uncertainty, preferring available direct net weighing. | cp_handover; cp_stock_broodstock_hatch; cp_stock_managed_rearing; cp_stock_harvest; cp_stock_holding; cp_stock_presentation | actual cohort wet mass and uncertainty | `pcr-live-aquaculture-method` |
| `integrated_release` | direct substance releases | For each actual waterborne substance and receiving medium, first retain gross outlet load L_out = sum(C_out,k * V_out,k), using concentration and discharged volume matched to each representative interval, with explicit unit and elemental/species conversions. Independently retain inlet load L_in = sum(C_in,j * V_in,j) for the same period/basis, other water fates, stocks and uncertainty. Gross outlet load is the default direct-release inventory; an out-minus-in balance is a separate diagnostic, not automatically an emission or removal credit. A foreground-attributable release may replace the gross inventory only under a documented, independently justified source/fate method that identifies the inlet/background share actually reaching that outlet and accounts for other outputs, retention, transformation and stock changes; retain both load records, the explicit attribution formula and applicability evidence, and use only one inventory representation. Never assume equal inlet/outlet volumes or substitute (C_out - C_background) * V_out without that evidence. Negative or uncertain differences remain review findings, not automatic negative emissions, uptake credits or zero. Retain nondetect handling and laboratory QA; missing volume, matching or attribution evidence blocks the affected result, and treatment-service expenditure cannot determine release mass. | cp_water_utilities; cp_water_residuals; cp_release_utilities; cp_release_residuals | gross outlet and inlet load records, separate diagnostic balance and one justified release inventory per substance/medium | `pcr-live-aquaculture-method` |
| `attribution_ledger` | shared outputs periods and assets | Measure independently first, then attribute common burden by demonstrated causal activity; shares sum to actual common total. Opening burden plus current inputs reconcile to actual handovers, closing stock and declared retirement fate without repeated attribution. | cp_stock_broodstock_hatch; cp_stock_managed_rearing; cp_stock_harvest; cp_stock_holding; cp_stock_presentation; cp_shared_utilities; cp_service_utilities; cp_service_presentation | evidenced attributed-burden ledger | `pcr-live-aquaculture-method` |

### Data Quality Requirements

| requirement_id | Applies to | Requirement | Evidence |
| --- | --- | --- | --- |
| `dq_trace` | all nodes | Cover each actual source stage and parent spawning event; match origin, count, mass, period, purpose and handovers, retaining source shares through pooling. | cp_stock_broodstock_hatch; cp_stock_managed_rearing; cp_stock_harvest; cp_stock_holding; cp_stock_presentation event chain and supplier primary records |
| `dq_quantity` | all amounts | Actual collected quantities take precedence; broad provisional ranges only screen outliers, never replace measurement, cap, clip or infer zero. Disclose sampling, factor and allocation uncertainty. For nondetects retain detection/quantification limits, censored-result method and bounds; never treat a nondetect as exact zero. Link final-outfall samples to source-stage events, measured flow/duration and original units. | calibration, sampling and outlier review |
| `dq_sources` | all supplier and release records | Check period, site, technology, species/stage and unit match; historical FAO examples support qualitative process understanding only, not current dosage, survival, stocking or feed-factor defaults. | evidence applicability assessment; method and supplier boundaries |
| `dq_complete` | all selected nodes | Distinguish actual non-use, measured zero and missing data; identify release media, treatment fate and shared consumers; missing data never auto-fill zero. | cp_water_utilities; cp_water_residuals, cp_release_utilities; cp_release_residuals, cp_residual_residuals and shared matrix |

## 9. Validation Rules

| rule_id | Applies to | Rule | source_ids |
| --- | --- | --- | --- |
| `v_reference` | aquaculture_live_handover | Require one species/cohort, actual farmed origin, declared seed/broodstock/live-fish-feed purpose, life stage and producer gate, net viable wet mass plus count, weighing and health/fitness evidence. Eggs/gametes, dead/rejected fish and nonfish organisms cannot satisfy the reference. | `un-cpc-3-2025`; `pcr-live-aquaculture-method` |
| `v_measurement` | all inventory rows | Check same-reference normalization, actual representative count-to-mass measurements, calibrated net weighing, moisture/density/gas conditions and energy units. Range outliers trigger reviewed evidence and uncertainty, never clipping or automatic invalidation; missing actual quantities remain gaps. | `pcr-live-aquaculture-method` |
| `v_routes` | broodstock_hatch; managed_rearing; harvest | Verify owned/purchased phase matrix and supplier burdens; spawning deltas reference broodstock_hatch and water deltas actual managed_rearing. With rearing check reared_live_transfer → harvest_stock_input; for actual hatchery-only seed check hatched_fish_transfer → harvest_stock_input, seed-stage fitness and evidence of phase absence. Require actual owned hatchery or rearing production; retain all hatchery/live-food resources, without fictitious stages or duplicate transfers. | `fao-seed-production`; `ifas-ras-health`; `pcr-live-aquaculture-method` |
| `v_balance` | all selected nodes | Reconcile fish counts and measured biomass with growth, opening/closing stocks, transfers, handovers, mortalities, rejection and escapes; growth means input/output wet mass need not be equal. Reconcile feed dry matter, nutrient intake and measured species releases with stated retention and solids, not a universal emission factor. | `pcr-live-aquaculture-method` |
| `v_completeness` | utilities; residuals | For each selected source-stage inspect actual resource categories, treatment and direct release records. Supplied water, own abstraction, circulation, waste handoff and direct discharge are distinct. Substance releases require species/basis, receiving medium, flow-duration, concentration/background and laboratory QA. | `pcr-live-aquaculture-method` |
| `v_attribution` | broodstock_hatch; managed_rearing; utilities | Check every intended output/handover, run/changeover, parent spawning cycle, period carryover, retirement fate and shared consumer matrix. Sum attributed shares to actual totals and ensure no repeated upstream, parent, asset, service or internal-transfer burden. | `pcr-live-aquaculture-method` |
| `v_binding` | all inventory rows | Each final dataset exchange needs a concrete verified identity matching substance/product, state, purpose, supply geography/technology/provider, flow type, direction and unit. Conditional collection obligations split into actual exchanges at data production. Candidate unresolved registrations and a structural check pass do not verify final identities. | `pcr-live-aquaculture-method` |
| `v_zero_gate` | conditional processes; presentation | Zero is accepted only with documented non-use or observed absence over the applicable stage/period. Unknown viability, purpose, route, handover state, quantity or release fate prevents a complete qualifying dataset; report performed and skipped validation coverage. | `pcr-live-aquaculture-method` |
| `validate_inventory_completion` | all concrete exchanges and section 8 completion obligations | Verify each applicable dq_complete obligation has separately measured and identity-verified exchange cards. Check each quantity, native unit, range evidence, normalization, receiving medium, destination and non-duplication. Any unfulfilled actual child exchange, quantity, identity or destination makes the final dataset incomplete and fails validation; unknown cannot be zero. Static PCR checking does not replace this evidence. |  |

## 10. Published Dataset Profile

| Field | Value |
| --- | --- |
| dataset_role | secondary_dataset; background_dataset |
| downstream_use | Foreground aquaculture-purpose live-fish data package first; verified downstream process or lifecyclemodel projection |
| allowed_use | Upstream seed, broodstock or live-fish-feed input matching declared purpose, species, life stage, viability/fitness, gates and technology/period |
| excluded_use | No food, ornamental, wild-origin, final-egg or nonfish-feed substitution; no cross-purpose/stage equivalence from kilograms alone; no final use of unverified exchanges |
| required_metadata | PCR/version; species/cohort and one purpose; life stage; count/net mass; origin-stage matrix; spawning/water system; site/period; gate/holding route; upstream references and attribution |
| required_quality_disclosure | Measurement/sampling uncertainty; all source stages and parent carryover; shared asset/service attribution; mortality/escape/emission fate; identity verification/gaps; range evidence and skipped checks |
| update_trigger | Changes in purpose/species/stage, spawning/water system, supplier/gate, resource/health/treatment, parent retirement or attribution; new measurement/identity evidence; material loss/release events |
