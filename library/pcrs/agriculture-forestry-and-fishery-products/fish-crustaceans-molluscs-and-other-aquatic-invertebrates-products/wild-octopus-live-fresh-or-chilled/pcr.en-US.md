# Wild raw whole chilled common octopus from unbaited earthenware shelter pots

## 1. Scope and Applicability

This PCR is a deliberately narrow capture-and-first-handover methodology, not a full CPC leaf description. It covers only eastern Atlantic/Mediterranean wild Octopus vulgaris sensu stricto taken with unbaited unglazed earthenware shelter pots, delivered raw, whole, ungutted and actually chilled never frozen at first harvester physical recipient acceptance. Actual recorded chilling is a selection condition, not an empirical claim about all landings. IPMA's documented short first-sale samples were not chilled; Codex provides qualitative handling guidance, not proof of this route.

No baited trapping, other shelter materials, farming, cleaned cuts, deliberate arm removal, tenderization/beating/tumbling, freshwater soaking, intentional weight-increasing water/additives, frozen/thawed or live reference product. Natural healed arm damage does not automatically disqualify a whole animal; document the actual state. No assertion of ready-to-eat safety, legality, zero bycatch or sustainability follows.

## 4. Measurement and Unit Rules

| rule_id | Applies to | Required property | Required unit | Rule |
| --- | --- | --- | --- | --- |
| reference_mass | reference product | Mass `93a60a56-a3c8-11da-a746-0800200b9a66` | kg | Weigh the same physically accepted lot on calibrated scales after a documented repeatable drainage procedure, subtracting actual container tare, ice and free water. Retain native animal viscera/attached arms; document natural healed damage. Do not infer net mass from sale price/count or force a perfect-eight-arm mass. |
| mass_energy | all inventory rows | Mass and energy as declared per row | kg; kWh | Retain original units and conversion evidence; g/1000 and t×1000 yield kg, kWh×3.6 yields MJ when needed. Never convert bulk water to pollutant mass or service units to kg without independent evidence. |

## 5. System Boundary

### Boundary Abstraction

| Field | Value |
| --- | --- |
| declared_starting_condition | Wild natural habitat and actual shelter-pot capture, not purchased or farmed octopus |
| starting_condition_role | Declared foreground capture boundary, with upstream resources/assets recursively supplied |
| product_classification_scope | cpc:3.0:04471; narrower |
| recursive_input_rule | No purchased same-category animal enters the selected reference. Separate such lots and use compatible upstream methodology; internal same-lot transfers carry existing burden once, never repeat capture. |
| upstream_dataset_requirement | Use compatible supplier/site/period/geography technology datasets for actual fuels, electricity, ice, water, materials, assets and inclusive services; disclose gaps |
| disclosure | Actual trip/lot/state/gate, full-period ledgers, stocks/losses, direct/provider ownership, intended outputs, service-life evidence and attribution |

| rule_id | Applies to | Rule | source_ids |
| --- | --- | --- | --- |
| exclusive_resource_events | all nodes | Partition each physical supply/use event into exactly one compatible resource card: named fishery ice, water, containers, shared assets, supplier-inclusive services or remaining fuels/consumables. Generic consumables do not duplicate named supplies. Separate an asset/container physical custody movement from its once-only service/provision burden; actual inward empty-container returns are receipts in containers_in, while containers_at_gate records only outward handoffs. Record stock and direction without treating return movements as new purchases or co-products. |  |
| chronology | all nodes | The process map is a responsibility map, not a mandatory delay until after sorting before cooling. Actual icing/chilling may begin immediately on capture and continue through preparation/sorting/presentation/delivery. Record the chronological state, temperature-time and lot/transfer ids at each real handoff; link each early, repeated or continuing chilling event to its single actual resource-owning node and protocol, without missing or duplicating electricity, ice, water or equipment. A pre-chill label never permits an unchilled final lot. |  |
| support_instances | support | Identify each actual support instance by operation/resource owner, site, period, service/asset/treatment id, consuming node and physical incoming/outgoing state. cp_support is only the protocol for these real support instances, never a synthetic all-processes owner. Close physical same-transfer sender/receiver quantities before output attribution; attributed LCA shares cannot replace physical mass closure. Assign a different actual direct-release owner only with its documented node/protocol record. |  |
| ecological_ledger | capture | Retain species, live/dead condition, number/mass, capture/release locations and times, retention fate, gear loss and actual habitat-disturbance observations for target/incidental catches. Keep these physical/ecological records separately from attributed LCA quantities; animal removal or release is not automatically a verified elementary biomass exchange. Use a separately justified concrete model for any such exchange, not a fake UUID, zero-bycatch assertion or sustainability/avoided-production credit. |  |
| capture_context | capture | Start with wild animals in their natural eastern Atlantic/Mediterranean habitat and actual unbaited unglazed-earthenware shelter-pot operations; include deployment, soak/retrieval, outbound/return, unsuccessful/support trips and actual lost gear. Wild growth is not farm production. Select species sensu stricto from traceable identification, not worldwide species-complex labels. | fao-traps-pots; ipma-polqual-2017; fao-cephalopods-vol3 |
| selected_chilled_state | chill | The chilled never-frozen subroute is this PCR selection, not a claim about all Portuguese landings. Require actual icing/cooling, elapsed prechill and temperature/time records through acceptance; unchilled, live-reference, frozen, thawed, gutted or tenderized lots fail selection. Codex gives guidance, while the IPMA source samples were not chilled. | ipma-polqual-2017; codex-fish-2012 |
| operation_owner | all nodes | Direct foreground operation is operation/resource responsibility, including leased or contracted equipment where actual resources are foreground-controlled; it is not legal title. Model supplier-inclusive service once at support_service and exclude duplicate direct resources/emissions/assets. Document provider versus foreground responsibility before attribution. |  |
| physical_first | all nodes | First retain complete physical trip/lot/event/period ledgers and unique resource owners, then attribute to actual intended output using section 7. Keep whole-fleet zero-output periods, carryover stocks, gear provision/repair/replacement/end-of-use and idle/support-return events; do not omit them because accepted output is zero. Transfer inherited burdens once. |  |
| water_residual_owner | all nodes | Pair each real internal usable-water and contained-waste transfer by source/destination/transfer id before allocation. Only actual natural-to-foreground abstraction is elementary uptake; same-node circulation and stock movement are subledgers. The actual direct release or external final-treatment handoff has one owner. Split wastewater bulk from substance masses; no implicit recycling/rework or duplicate purchase. |  |
| gate | handover | Include actual harvester transport and continuing chill before first recipient physical acceptance; record place/time, net animal mass and ownership of each pre-gate event. Exclude buyer processing, gutting, tenderization, downstream distribution, cooking and use. This LCA gate is not a food-safety, legality or sustainability certificate. |  |

## 6. Process Inventory Structure

### Process Map

| process_id | process_name | inclusion | inclusion_condition | role | quantitative_reference |
| --- | --- | --- | --- | --- | --- |
| `capture` | Unbaited shelter-pot capture | required | Selected route; record actual resources only | Seabed deployment, soak, retrieval and vessel trips, including zero-catch trips | per 1 kg reference flow |
| `prepare` | Initial whole-animal preparation | required | Selected route; record actual resources only | Remove detached foreign debris; rinse only if actually performed, without gutting or water-addition treatment | per 1 kg reference flow |
| `sort` | Destination and condition sorting | required | Selected route; record actual resources only | Identify accepted whole lots, other intended grades and rejected destinations | per 1 kg reference flow |
| `chill` | Actual icing and chilled holding | required | Selected route; record actual resources only | Own actual initial/continuing cooling of the selected whole-animal lot; record the real event chronology and chilled never-frozen handoff state | per 1 kg reference flow |
| `present` | Presentation and container preparation | required | Selected route; record actual resources only | Present chilled animals in identified containers; no change in animal mass basis | per 1 kg reference flow |
| `handover` | Harvester delivery and physical acceptance | required | Selected route; record actual resources only | Include actual pre-acceptance harvester shore movement and continuing chill; end at first physical recipient acceptance | per 1 kg reference flow |
| `support` | Shared support and residual handling | required | Selected route; record actual resources only | Own actual shared assets, usable-water provision and contained residual custody/treatment, not product processing | per 1 kg reference flow |

Nodes distinguish responsibilities and measured state handoffs; they need not be separate buildings or crews. Trip/lot batches are linked to full reporting periods, cleaning/changeovers, zero-output runs and shared resources. Conditional material/service cards instantiate zero, one or multiple actual exchanges; no forced activity. Capture is independent removal, preparation is debris removal/actual rinse, sorting declares destinations, the chilling responsibility owns actual initial/continuing cooling events regardless of their real chronology, presentation protects it and handover includes pre-gate delivery without duplicating chill production.

## 7. Allocation and Co-product Handling

| rule_id | Applies to | Rule | source_ids |
| --- | --- | --- | --- |
| subdivide | all nodes | Prefer actual subdivision of independently metered events/nodes and outputs. Keep full physical amounts separately from output-attributed LCA quantities. For shared unavoidable events, document the causal driver and all intended output shares before normalization; never apply animal yield to erase unsuccessful trips or ecological records. |  |
| output_decision | other_intended_grades; support_recovered_material | Enumerate actual independently intended outputs, grade destinations and handoffs, then justify physical causal attribution. If no defensible physical relationship exists, use documented economic attribution only as a disclosed fallback with consistent actual period/grade prices and sensitivity. No default method, price, allocation fraction or substitution credit is specified. Residue/reject/dead-waste/release are not products by default. |  |
| period_asset | support_shared_assets | Index actual manufacture/provision, deployment, repair, idle, replacement/loss and termination phases and consuming nodes/periods. Attribute documented service over an evidenced lifetime/service denominator, reconcile cumulative shares to one and carry unused stocks forward. No default pot lifetime, trip count or annual catch. Missing termination/replacement or full-period evidence blocks finalization. |  |
| normalize | all inventory rows | Normalize the justified output-attributed amount of each row by the accepted net wet mass of that same selected lot/period, producing per 1 kg reference flow. Do not normalize zero-output periods in isolation; retain and carry their evidenced burden to the justified reporting output or disclose an unresolved attribution. Internal product transfers retain their actual masses and inherited burden once, not 1 kg each. |  |

### Calculation Rules

| rule_id | Applies to | Formula or rule | Inputs | Output | source_ids |
| --- | --- | --- | --- | --- | --- |
| physical_balance | all inventory rows | Reconcile opening stock + actual incoming = actual outgoing + closing stock for each material/state/node/period, with measured transformations and separately recorded natural gain/loss where relevant; do not force equality by adding a fictitious flow. | Opening/closing stocks; actual transfers; measured transformations | Reconciled raw physical ledgers |  |
| attributed_normalization | all inventory rows | For each physically owned row apply the documented section 7 intended-output share once; divide by actual accepted net animal wet mass of the selected reporting output. Retain full physical ledger and zero-output carryover separately; final reference is 1 kg, not every internal transfer. | Physical row amount; justified attribution share; accepted net animal wet mass; cp_handover | per 1 kg reference flow |  |
| direct_emission | direct elementary outputs | Use measured substance mass or documented fuel/material inventory × independently evidenced substance-specific factor with compatible fossil fraction and receiving compartment; no factor is supplied by this PCR. | Measured substances or actual inventory/factor evidence; actual owner | Individual substance mass in actual compartment |  |

| instantiated_ranges | all inventory rows | For every umbrella card instantiated as multiple actual exchanges, assign a distinct instance id, substance/material, state, property/unit, destination/receiving compartment, collection evidence and independently justified U to each exchange. The parent row-specific U label is an unresolved template only, neither a shared bound for all instances nor an aggregate upper limit. Never apply one instance's evidence or U to another without independently justified compatibility. |  |
| selection | reference product | Require traceable O. vulgaris sensu stricto, eastern Atlantic/Mediterranean location, wild unbaited earthenware-pot capture, raw whole ungutted presentation, actual chilled never-frozen history and first physical recipient acceptance. Reject other species-complex members, baited traps/PVC/tyres, aquaculture, deliberate arm cutting, beating/tumbling, soaking/additives, frozen/thawed, gutted or live-reference lots. |  |
| ledgers | all inventory rows | Reconcile physical animals through capture, prepare, sort, chill, present and handover with retained/rejected/released/stock fates, natural arm damage and actual moisture changes. Animal feed mass is not every node output1; exclude ice/free water/tare from reference mass. Independently reconcile water/ice, containers, fuel and residues, actual owner and stock carryover before allocation. |  |
| provisional_limits | all inventory rows | Each nonfinal Range is an unresolved row-specific U requirement, not a measured bound, typical value or permission to substitute a number. Establish and approve U from independent prior/source/capacity evidence before use; the same batch maximum cannot validate itself. Use actual records and investigate departures; absence of U, missing flow identity/support or missing process records remains a disclosed gap. |  |
| ownership | all nodes | Check single-node protocols, all zero-output/run/changeover periods, complete intended outputs and attribution shares, shared infrastructure consumers/life phases, paired usable-water/residual transfers and exactly one direct release/treatment owner. An absent activity needs explicit evidence, not an invented zero. A structural check does not verify external identities or food safety. |  |
| `validate_atomic_completion` | all applicable collection requirements and concrete inventory exchanges | Resolve every applicable section-8 collection requirement into individual physical/chemical exchanges with their own quantities, native units, composition/state, range basis or explicit uncertainty evidence, raw records, normalization, actual destinations/receiving media and verified compatible UUIDs. Any unresolved applicable requirement makes the final dataset incomplete and validation fails; unknown is not zero. Never copy aggregate amounts onto components or duplicate inclusive services with owned fuel/electricity/direct releases. Internal transfers are not fixed to the final 1 kg. | |
