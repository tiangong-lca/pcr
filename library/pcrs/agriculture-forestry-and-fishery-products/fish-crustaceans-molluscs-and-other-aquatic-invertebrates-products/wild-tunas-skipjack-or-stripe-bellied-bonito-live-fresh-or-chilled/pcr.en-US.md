# Wild head-on gutted food tunas and skipjack at first producer handover

## 1. Scope and Applicability

This PCR governs foreground data for wild marine Thunnus species and Katsuwonus pelamis captured and producer-responsibly killed/bled/eviscerated with the head retained, delivered as fresh or nonfrozen chilled food fish at first producer handover. A market name “bonito” does not replace species identification. Only actual handling and technology are included: no obligatory purse seine, longline, FAD, slurry or fixed chronology. The reference is net carcass, not boneless edible meat, reconstructed whole fish or packaged gross mass.

Exclude farming/ranching/fattening, live fish transferred to farming, live or ungutted final whole fish, headed fish, loins/fillets/steaks, organs as reference, frozen/thawed or processed-preserved products, later merchant gate and nonfood final use. If species/form/acceptance or nonfrozen state cannot be confirmed, define another boundary or retain a data gap; never relabel state to fit.

## 4. Measurement and Unit Rules

| rule_id | Applies to | Required property | Required unit | Rule |
| --- | --- | --- | --- | --- |
| `reference_net_mass` | reference product | Mass | kg | Use handover node cp_handover_mass calibrated weighing of accepted head-on gutted carcass, excluding free water, ice, packaging and removed organs; retained gills remain carcass mass. Do not reconstruct whole fish from organ yields. |
| `support_chain` | mass and energy inventory | Mass `93a60a56-a3c8-11da-a746-0800200b9a66`; Net calorific value `93a60a56-a3c8-11da-a746-0800200c9a66` | kg; MJ | Mass unit group `93a60a57-a4c8-11da-a746-0800200c9a66`: kg=1, t=1000, g=0.001; energy unit group `93a60a57-a3c8-11da-a746-0800200c9a66`: MJ=1, kWh=3.6. Matching property conversions only; service property/unit requires separate evidence. |
| `physical_units` | all inventory rows | Mass or actual energy/service property | kg; MJ; actual service unit | Mass rows use actual wet kg; convert density, wet/dry basis or counts only with evidence. Energy uses actual MJ or evidenced kWh×3.6. Supplier service retains real invoice functional unit, not invented material kg; unresolved property/unit blocks final exchange. |
| `two_views` | all inventory rows | Actual row property | per 1 kg reference flow | Close the unallocated actual receipt/transfer/output/loss/stock ledger first, owning shared node/period resources once, then divide by positive accepted final net kg; separate single-output LCA inventory/burdens follow section 7 once, retaining physical ledger and matrix. Economic shares never shrink physical partitions. |

## 5. System Boundary

### Boundary Abstraction

| Field | Value |
| --- | --- |
| declared_starting_condition | Actual wild marine stock context, complete voyage opening, equipment/bait stocks and supply-chain receipts; no foreground aquaculture biomass production |
| starting_condition_role | Wild removal context and burden-bearing product/service supply, not free bait or burden exemption |
| product_classification_scope | CPC 3.0:04251; narrower |
| recursive_input_rule | Own catch enters internal handling, not a newly recursively produced final product. Purchased post-first-gate same-category resale fish is outside this route; purchased same-species bait remains independent supplied product and burden. |
| upstream_dataset_requirement | Provide matching source/state/unit upstream data for actual fuel, electricity, water, ice, bait, materials, services and assets; own supply records its actual resources without duplicate supplied-product burden. |
| disclosure | Disclose voyage responsibility/opening/closing periods, actual chronology/gate, stocks/failed no-output periods, purchased/own resource ownership, service inclusions, coproduct attribution, asset-use/life evidence and unresolved identity/quantity gaps. |

### Boundary Rules

| rule_id | Applies to | Rule | source_ids |
| --- | --- | --- | --- |
| `scope_origin` | all foreground | Include actual wild marine capture of Thunnus spp. or Katsuwonus pelamis through own first producer food handover of head-on gutted fresh/nonfrozen chilled fish. Capture is an independent removal responsibility; it does not imply farming and differs from subsequent gutting. | `un-cpc3-notes`; `noaa-tuna-gear`; `fao-tuna-handling-2025` |
| `actual_sequence` | all handling nodes | The map is a responsibility list, not a fixed timeline. Keep event/pass/transfer ids and actual predecessor/successor state for every revisit. Grading, pre-chilling, killing/bleeding/gutting, gilling, washing and presentation may occur in actual evidenced order. Final handover requires completed gutting and actual food acceptance irrespective of last node name; unknown status is pending stock/data gap, never an inactive default. | `fao-tuna-handling-2025` |
| `capture_delta` | capture; bait_supply; fad_service | Parent activity is capture. Hook/line methods activate actual purchased or own bait responsibility; purse-seine/skiff operation activates its actual equipment/energy and only evidenced FAD-associated events activate fad_service. Free-school/FAD-associated sets and gear variants are disjoint event facts, not duplicated catch. Retain observed bycatch, releases, deaths, gear/material loss and habitat/animal interactions; no universal impact claim, FAD life, catch efficiency or factor. | `noaa-tuna-gear`; `noaa-yellowfin` |
| `mass_interfaces` | all nodes | Physical unallocated ledgers record actual species/tissues, water/ice, packaging, stock, loss and intended products first. Gutting must reconcile incoming whole fish with head-on gutted carcass, actually removed viscera/liver/roe/gills/blood and all measured fates; retained gills/tissues remain carcass mass. Do not assume whole input equals final gutted mass, or count the same blood/tissue both in waste mixture and constituent discharge. |  |
| `gate_and_trip` | capture; shared_resources; handover | Gate is the actual first producer-responsible food handover at sea, port or another documented collector point, not automatically port. Stop fish handling there, but retain attributable complete outward/search/fishing/return, failed/no-output voyages, idle/maintenance and asset service periods. No new downstream merchant holding or distribution activity belongs inside presentation. |  |
| `resource_ownership` | all nodes; shared_resources | Assign each actual resource/event to one node and period, excluding supplier-service-inclusive fuel, power, water and packaging from duplicate direct rows. shared_resources owns only genuine unpartitioned pools and assets across named consuming nodes/periods. Actual purchased services retain their provider functional unit and scope; if unsupported, preserve invoice and unresolved property/unit in auxiliary ledger before exchange publication. |  |
| `cold_history` | grade; chill; handover | Retain capture/death/bleeding/gutting/chill/transfer times, temperatures, instrument evidence, deviations and applicable competent-authority/market acceptance. Histamine-related hazards require actual decision evidence; later chilling/washing does not erase earlier unsafe history. This methodology does not certify food safety, set universal time/temperature limits or import US rules globally. | `fda-histamine-2024`; `fao-tuna-handling-2025` |

## 6. Process Inventory Structure

Every card reports the same final reference basis; actual conditions control applicability and absent roles do not manufacture positive exchanges. Paired inter-node physical flows preserve raw quantities; revisits do not duplicate burdens. Provisional ranges are broad screening starting points, neither default quantities nor proof of fishery-specific plausibility. Service cards expand by provider in actual functional units; unresolved unit/property remains an auxiliary-ledger gap.

### Process Map

| process_id | process_name | inclusion | inclusion_condition | role | quantitative_reference |
| --- | --- | --- | --- | --- | --- |
| `bait_supply` | Own bait capture and bounded bait maintenance | conditional | Only actual fishery-owned bait capture or maintenance supplying this voyage; purchased bait goes directly to capture. | foreground responsibility | actual bait supplied, remaining stock and all fates |
| `capture` | Wild tuna capture and retrieval | required | Actual wild marine capture event, not farming, ranching or fattening. | foreground responsibility | retained whole catch and incidental biomass |
| `conditioning` | Producer killing, bleeding and gutting | required | Actual producer-responsible head-on evisceration; optional gilling and washing are recorded as actually performed. | foreground responsibility | Actual partial-condition and completed head-on gutted transfers, removed organs/blood/gills and stocks |
| `grade` | Actual food/destination grading | required | Actual classification and intended-food acceptance, wherever in the handling sequence performed. | foreground responsibility | accepted food, other intended products, waste and stock |
| `chill` | Producer nonfreezing chilling and cold maintenance | conditional | Only actual icing, chilled water/slurry, mechanical chilling or bounded cold holding before first gate; no freezing/thawing. | foreground responsibility | same-lot nonfrozen fish at actual pass state |
| `present` | Protective presentation | conditional | Only actual producer wrapping, boxing, labelling or protective presentation before the gate. | foreground responsibility | presented fish and separate packaging material |
| `handover` | First producer food handover | required | Only after actual species/form, food acceptance and cold-chain evidence are reconciled. | foreground responsibility | accepted net head-on gutted fish mass |
| `fad_service` | Actual FAD and buoy service | conditional | Only evidenced FAD-associated capture events and their asset/service periods; free-school events do not activate this node. | capture technology service | actual deployment/retrieval/service and material fates |
| `shared_resources` | Shared vessel/port assets and unpartitioned services | required | Actual common assets, maintenance and otherwise unowned pooled resources; include failed/no-output and return periods. | shared resource ownership | service-period responsibility and reconciled shared resources |

### Process: Own bait capture and bounded bait maintenance (`bait_supply`)

Record this node by actual event/pass/transfer id and timestamp; retain physical mass/stock ledger, resource ownership and separate LCA attributed view. An inactive condition does not create exchanges.

###### Actual head-retained fish transferred before gutting is complete (`conditioning_partially_prepared_fish`)

Only a real intermediate pass handing still-ungutted or partly prepared head-retained fish to an actual next node, for example a documented cold intervention before later gut removal. Record actual live/dead, bleeding, gut/gill, grade and thermal state, measured raw mass and paired event/pass/transfer ids. Keep gutting pending; pair its later return with the actual receiving pass. This is mutually exclusive for the same parcel/pass with completed gutted output, not a second carcass sale or fixed final 1 kg. Final handover still requires completed evisceration and all food/nonfrozen qualifiers.

## 7. Allocation and Co-product Handling

| rule_id | Applies to | Rule | source_ids |
| --- | --- | --- | --- |
| `physical_then_lca` | all inventory | Keep two labelled views: unallocated physical receipts/transfers/outputs/losses/stocks with node/period shared-resource ownership once, then normalize to positive accepted final net kg; separately retain a single-output LCA attributed inventory/burden view plus allocation matrix. Apply output shares only to relevant burden/attributed exchange ownership, never to physical carcass/organ/water partitions, and never twice at downstream handover. |  |
| `attribution_order` | bait_supply; capture; conditioning; grade; present; handover | First subdivide independently metered responsibilities and assign direct intended-product burdens. For genuinely joint remaining burdens, use an evidenced physical causal relationship only if justified for this fishery/handling boundary; otherwise use consistent economic shares of actual accepted output quantities and comparable same-gate values over the stated period, with sensitivity to data uncertainty. Retain chosen boundary, numerator/denominator, zero-value handling and alternative sensitivity. No invented zero burden, substitution or ecosystem credit. |  |
| `output_set` | bait_supply; capture; conditioning; grade; present; handover | Enumerate intended target and other catch, independent organ/offal/bait products and accepted other grades at their actual external handoffs. Internal transfers do not create new intended outputs. Waste, live return, dead discharge, retained stocks and packaging physically accompanying product are separately classified; organ removal alone does not prove coproduct status. |  |
| `trip_period_assets` | capture; fad_service; shared_resources | Declare voyage/batch/campaign boundaries and actual phases: departure/search/capture/handling/return/idle/cleaning/maintenance, FAD/buoy deployment/retrieval/replacement/retirement and vessel/port asset service. Retain no-output periods in the appropriate campaign burden pool; do not divide them by zero or drop them. Use observed service capacity/time/use and period opening/closing stocks, no universal lifetime. Resolve missing replacement/termination evidence before quantitative finalization. |  |
| `shared_once` | all nodes | For each shared vessel, generator, cold store, port facility, FAD/buoy or external service, identify all actual consumers and periods, record metered subdivision or justified capacity/time-use share, reconcile shares to the complete owned pool, and subtract already inclusive/direct responsibilities. Repeated handling passes inherit no second manufacturing charge or repeated output allocation. |  |

### Calculation Rules

| rule_id | Applies to | Formula or rule | Inputs | Output | source_ids |
| --- | --- | --- | --- | --- | --- |
| `physical_normalization` | all inventory rows | First close unallocated actual opening/receipt/transfer/output/loss/closing stock ledger and own shared node/period resources once; then divide by positive accepted final net kg. Separate LCA attributed view applies relevant output shares only once under section 7, retaining original ledger/matrix without shrinking mass partitions. | actual node records; accepted final net kg; allocation matrix | per 1 kg reference flow |  |
| `carcass_partition` | conditioning | Actual whole-fish receipts plus opening fish equal mutually exclusive actual partial-condition or completed head-on gutted transfers for that pass, removed organ/blood/gill fates, rejects/losses and closing fish; water/packaging use separate ledgers. Keep physical mass unallocated; retained gills/tissues remain carcass, and dissolved blood mixture/constituents cannot duplicate. | cp_conditioning_mass; paired transfers | physical closure and actual yield |  |
| `cold_history` | grade; chill; handover | Join same-lot species capture/death/handling/gate timestamps with continuous temperature records, deviations and applicable acceptance evidence; missing intervals are not controlled by default and later cooling does not reverse history; no fixed numeric threshold. | actual lot history; instruments; acceptance decision | traceable state and acceptance gap decision | fda-histamine-2024 |
| `water_fates` | all inventory rows | Separate actual supplied/abstracted/paired internal water and ice/melt ledgers; reconcile product-carried, transfer, treatment, actual-medium discharge, evidenced evaporation and stocks per period. Recirculation throughput is not new abstraction; pollutants and mixture amounts reconcile without duplication. | actual node mass and fate records | water/ice physical balance and identity-specific discharges |  |
| `direct_emissions` | all inventory rows | Use actual single-substance measurements or actual fuel carbon/composition/fossil fraction/oxidation and sourced factors; retain model algebra, units, raw factors, independent validation and uncertainty. Flow UUID supplies no factor. | node-specific emission protocol; actual fuel; factor/source | actual substance-specific release |  |
| `range_replacement` | all inventory rows | Provisional upper bounds only screen initial authoring, not allowed limits or filler amounts.

## 9. Validation Rules

| rule_id | Applies to | Rule | source_ids |
| --- | --- | --- | --- |
| `reference_scope` | handover_final | Check wild Thunnus/Katsuwonus pelamis, retained head, removed viscera and actual gill state, nonfrozen fresh/chilled condition, food acceptance and actual first producer gate. Reject other bonito species, farming/ranching, live/whole-ungutted final product, heading, fillets/loins/steaks, organs, frozen/thawed or processed products from denominator. | `un-cpc3-notes` |
| `sequence_and_pairs` | all nodes | Every selected node and revisit has actual event/pass/transfer ids, compatible preceding/following state and paired internal quantity. Mandatory conditioning, actual destination grading and food/cold-history evidence are complete before final gate; node ordering never substitutes for evidence. |  |
| `physical_closure` | all nodes | Reconcile unallocated mass separately for fish/tissue, bait, water/ice, packaging and operational materials with opening plus receipts equals actual outputs plus losses plus closing stock, within declared measurement uncertainty. Separate environmental removal from purchased suppliers and inter-node transfers; flag missing fates, not force closure with evaporation. |  |
| `quantitative_gap` | all inventory | Each actual identity/unit/state/node has a Range, records and independent QA envelope. Provisional screening estimates are not measured defaults or accepted allowed limits: outliers trigger investigation, never clipping or false pass. Missing actual quantities, empirical support, service-unit conversion, substance identity or fate evidence remains an explicit data gap; no finalized quantitative exchange from an unresolved umbrella. |  |
| `cold_acceptance` | grade; chill; handover | Compare continuous actual capture-to-gate history with applicable documented market/authority requirements and actual acceptance, including deviations, corrective decisions and missing intervals. No universal threshold, current-temperature-only pass or safety certification follows from this PCR. | `fda-histamine-2024` |
| `ownership_allocation` | all nodes | Check complete intended output set and external gates, direct/subdivided/joint attribution precedence, same-boundary values, actual production mode, cleaning/changeover/no-output/return periods and all asset consumers. Shares cover each owned pool exactly once; physical balances remain unallocated and downstream shares are not reapplied. |  |
| `gear_delta` | capture; bait_supply; fad_service | Validate actual gear/associated school facts per event and associated bait/skiff/FAD inputs, losses and responsibilities. Distinct gear events may coexist in campaign only with disjoint catch attribution. Own bait retains own capture/holding resources; nature returns and protected-species interaction notes confer no ecosystem credit. | `noaa-tuna-gear` |
| `validate_inventory_completion` | all concrete exchanges and section 8 completion obligations | Verify each applicable dq_complete obligation has separately measured and identity-verified exchange cards. Check each quantity, native unit, range evidence, normalization, receiving medium, destination and non-duplication. Any unfulfilled actual child exchange, quantity, identity or destination makes the final dataset incomplete and fails validation; unknown cannot be zero. Static PCR checking does not replace this evidence. |  |

## 10. Published Dataset Profile

| downstream_use | secondary_dataset; background_dataset |
| allowed_use | Use for process or lifecyclemodel projections only when species/origin/form/first gate, actual technology/period match and concrete exchange identity/quantity gaps are resolved |
| excluded_use | Not whole-CPC-leaf equivalent, farmed/live/ungutted/headed/processed/frozen-thawed products, later merchant gate, food-safety certification or complete quantitative data while gaps remain |
| required_metadata | Species/waterbody/dates, gear/school association, actual handling events, net mass/gill state, complete cold-history acceptance, first gate, voyage/campaign periods, intended output set, allocation matrix, supplier service and asset boundaries |
| required_quality_disclosure | Actual data coverage, representativeness/calibration/uncertainty, physical closure, independent QA and provisional ranges, unresolved identity/property/unit/quantity, failed no-output and service-inclusive ownership |
| update_trigger | Species/boundary/form/gate, actual technology/cold acceptance or supplier/asset ownership changes; resolved identity/quantity evidence and empirical ranges |
