# Wild live ornamental Pacific cleaner shrimp

## 1. Scope and Applicability

This PCR covers wild, whole, live, never-frozen Pacific cleaner shrimp (Lysmata amboinensis) collected from reefs in the Trincomalee, Sri Lanka context by the actual documented hand-net, SCUBA-diver and boat branch, through first local ornamental buyer physical custody. Apply only where primary trip records confirm species, wild origin, capture location, hand net, SCUBA and actual boat service for the selected lot. The field study documents community gear and actual species commerce, but does not assign this species to a particular gear/boat combination; its evidence alone cannot establish application eligibility [priyashadi-ornamental-trincomalee-2023].

Capture, live sorting, actual bounded holding or evidenced bypass, carrier-seawater/protective presentation and every physical movement before first buyer receipt are separate responsibilities. Holding is conditional on observed bounded intervention, with actual start/end, inputs and before/after live states. Unknown holding state remains a data gap. No compulsory acclimation, oxygen, salinity, temperature, holding duration, diagnostic threshold, parasite-removal, castration or disease-free procedure is prescribed.

Exclude farmed animals, ornamental fish, other species as the reference product, food products, dead reference animals, frozen/processed products and downstream buyer/exporter operations after first physical receipt. Record other intended catch/grades as separate outputs rather than broadening the reference. No wild growth, natural feeding, habitat benefit, environmental credit, animal-health, safety, legality or welfare claim is inferred.

## 3. Reference Flow

| Field | Value |
| --- | --- |
| What | Whole live ornamental Pacific cleaner shrimp at first local buyer physical receipt |
| How much | 1 kg accepted net animal wet mass |
| How well | Confirmed Lysmata amboinensis; wild origin; live with native body/appendages; actual accepted commercial size and condition; never frozen; ornamental destination |
| How long or cycle | Declared trip/lot and receipt interval, linked to reporting periods including failed trips, open stock, container reuse, asset service, cleaning, replacement and closure |
| reference_flow_link | `buyer_live_shrimp` |

| Field | Value |
| --- | --- |
| Reference amount | 1 |
| Reference product flow | Whole live ornamental Pacific cleaner shrimp at first local buyer physical receipt |
| Reference flow property | Mass `93a60a56-a3c8-11da-a746-0800200b9a66` |
| Reference unit group | Units of mass `93a60a57-a4c8-11da-a746-0800200c9a66` |
| Reference unit | kg |
| Required qualifiers | species; wild origin; reef/capture location; trip and lot; actual hand-net SCUBA boat route; whole live native body and appendages; never frozen; commercial count; commercial size and condition; measured same-lot animal mass basis; actual holding state and evidence; carrier-water and packaging separation; first local ornamental buyer physical custody place and time; reporting period and stock linkage |

A dataset must declare every required qualifier. Commercial per-individual/count records are retained; they never supply a species-wide standard animal mass. Receipt requires physical custody evidence, independently of contract, invoice, payment or payer.

## 4. Measurement and Unit Rules

| rule_id | Applies to | Required property | Required unit | Rule |
| --- | --- | --- | --- | --- |
| `reference_mass` | reference product | Mass | kg | Measure accepted net whole live animal wet mass A for the actual received lot using cp_logistics, with water, container, package and incidentals independently excluded and actual live/count/condition records retained. A must be positive. |
| `animal_count_mass` | all animal rows | Mass | kg | Preserve native commercial animal counts and size/condition. Any count-to-mass conversion uses representative measured animals from the same lot, recorded sample count, net mass, timing and uncertainty; no generic animal mass or other-lot conversion. |
| `water_package_separation` | all inventory rows | Actual instance property | Actual native unit | Measure animals, managed carrier water, incidentals and packages independently; do not use gross transport mass as animal mass or infer water from animal count. Preserve supplied service, energy and material native units. |
| `transfer_identity` | all inventory rows | Actual instance property | Actual native unit | Every internal physical transfer has one id, owner, state, quantity and unit, reproduced exactly in output and paired input. Branch choice never fixes internal feed to 1 kg. |
| `release_basis` | direct return and emission instances | Actual substance property | Actual native unit | Identify each pollutant and receiving medium before binding. Distinguish direct seawater return from pollutant quantity, organism return from waste, product water supply from abstraction, treatment from discharge, and fossil from biogenic carbon. |

## 5. System Boundary

### Boundary Abstraction

| Field | Value |
| --- | --- |
| declared_starting_condition | Actual wild reef capture context and documented boat/diver trip, including attributable upstream inputs and shared assets |
| starting_condition_role | Foreground source-to-collected responsibility; natural growth is not a managed production stage or credited feed |
| product_classification_scope | A narrower wild live ornamental crustacean subset of CPC 3.0 04912; not whole-leaf coverage |
| recursive_input_rule | Purchased or returned same-category live animals and retained opening stock must preserve verified wild origin, inherited upstream burden, quantity and state; unresolved ancestry cannot be reset to zero or recaptured as a new environmental removal |
| upstream_dataset_requirement | Verified concrete input identities and appropriate upstream datasets for actual supplies, energy, diving/boat/logistics services, equipment/container service and treatment; disclose exclusions and substitutions |
| disclosure | Trip/species/route proof; ownership-independent receipt gate; holding active/bypass/unknown evidence; animal/water/package separation; every intended output/stock/waste/return; reporting periods and shared-burden ledger |

### Boundary Rules

| rule_id | Applies to | Rule | source_ids |
| --- | --- | --- | --- |
| `boundary_route` | capture | Community methods and species commerce are route evidence; application trip records must establish the selected hand-net SCUBA boat route for this species. Capture removes animals from wild context independently of sorting and preservation; no managed growout stage. | priyashadi-ornamental-trincomalee-2023 |
| `boundary_receipt` | logistics | Include all actual physical movement, handling and intermediate custody before first local ornamental buyer physical receipt, regardless payer/operator. An invoice, sale or contract is not the physical gate. Exclude actual post-receipt buyer operation. | |
| `boundary_holding` | holding | Activate only observed bounded live holding with start/end, usable live state before/after and measured inputs/outputs. Otherwise require evidenced bypass; unknown state blocks finalization rather than selecting bypass. | |
| `boundary_destinations` | all inventory rows | Enumerate every intended species/grade/resale/retained output with its own output instance and handoff, distinguish mortality/waste from downgraded commercial product, and observe incidental material entering sorting. | |
| `boundary_periods` | all processes | Include trip, sorting/holding/presentation batch, leg and reporting-period records; failed/no-output trips, opening/closing live stock, mortality, cleanup, shared services, infrastructure, container replacement and actual termination burdens remain attributable. | |
| `boundary_services` | all processes | A complete purchased service excludes duplicated constituent energy, assets and direct releases. For foreground-operated service record constituents and direct releases; treatment is modelled only when actual, with full subinventory or one complete service and never both. | |
| `boundary_water` | all water and release rows | Pair managed-water transfers, record new direct intake separately from purchased supply, and distinguish intended reuse, waste to treatment and actual direct return. Each actual treatment instance inside a node has separately identified material/service inputs, treatment outputs and substance-specific releases. | |
| `boundary_shared` | shared assets/services | Identify boat, diving/net/container equipment, holding/presentation site and vehicles actually shared among nodes/outputs/periods; record consumer list, acquisition, use, maintenance, replacement, service life, closure and one owner ledger. No universal lifetime. | |
| `boundary_classification` | reference product | Retain wild origin, ornamental purpose and live crustacean state; fish and farmed ornamentals are excluded. The narrower boundary does not cover all aquatic ornamental organisms. | un-cpc3-2025 |

## 6. Process Inventory Structure

### Process Map

| process_id | process_name | inclusion | inclusion_condition | role | quantitative_reference |
| --- | --- | --- | --- | --- | --- |
| `capture` | Wild reef capture | required | Trip records confirm hand-net SCUBA boat collection of wild Lysmata amboinensis | capture responsibility | recorded trip and retained unsorted live catch |
| `sorting` | Live grade and destination sorting | required | Every retained catch is reconciled by actual condition and destination | grading responsibility | recorded sorted live animals |
| `holding` | Bounded live holding | conditional | Actual start/end and intervention records establish bounded live holding; otherwise an evidenced bypass is required | preservation responsibility | recorded live animals leaving actual holding |
| `presentation` | Carrier-seawater and protective presentation | required | Actual animal, carrier-water and container states are recorded | presentation responsibility | recorded presented live animals |
| `logistics` | All movements through first physical local buyer receipt | required | Include every actual pre-receipt leg and intermediate transfer regardless operator or payer | delivery responsibility | 1 kg accepted net whole live animal mass at first local ornamental buyer physical receipt |

Trips are indexed batches; sorting, holding (if active), presentation and delivery legs retain their own event ids and reporting periods. Actual transfer records link nodes. T-CS-A/W/I link capture to sorting. T-SH-A/W link sorting to active holding; T-HP-A/W link holding to presentation. T-SP-A/W link sorting directly to presentation only for evidenced bypass. T-PL-A/W/P link presentation to logistics. Each alternate output remaining inside the foreground adds its own named paired input instance in the receiving node; external outputs record their actual recipient. Transfer events do not create duplicate purchases, abstractions or upstream burdens.

## 7. Allocation and Co-product Handling

| rule_id | Applies to | Rule | source_ids |
| --- | --- | --- | --- |
| `allocation_subdivision` | all processes | First subdivide independently measured capture, sorting, holding, presentation and logistics events and directly assign dedicated resources. Apply only one owner for each transfer/shared service; physical internal transfers carry no duplicated burden. | |
| `allocation_outputs` | mixed catch and grade outputs | Enumerate the full actual intended output set, including other species, lower commercial grades, resale, live retained/returned stock and independently intended container/water reuse. Separate product accompaniment from an independent product. After subdivision use measured causal service demand (boat/diver time, holding occupancy-time or leg payload-distance) when supported; document its physical rationale. | |
| `allocation_fallback` | inseparable shared output burden | When causal demand cannot be supported, use documented nonnegative comparable producer-gate net-sales-value shares across the actual intended outputs, using actual commercial counts/prices and sales records with a positive total-value denominator. Net sales value means comparable sales proceeds after documented sales adjustments, not profit. Explicitly value unsold/retained stock on an evidenced comparable producer-gate basis and disclose uncertainty. Zero, negative or unavailable output values or a nonpositive denominator require a separately justified alternative allocation and sensitivity; compare a measured animal-mass alternative. If neither physical nor value-based attribution can be evidenced, retain an unresolved burden rather than zero. No substitution/avoided-product credit. | |
| `allocation_periods` | periods and stock | Link acquisition, operation, failed/no-output trips, opening/closing live stock, mortality/replacement, cleanup, maintenance and termination to trip/batch/leg/reporting period. Carry inherited burden with retained/returned stock to the next period exactly once. Include failed-trip burden in the relevant period's actual intended output pool with declared rationale and sensitivity; a period with no accepted output remains an unresolved carried burden, never divide by zero. | |
| `allocation_assets` | shared infrastructure and reuse | Maintain one asset/service ledger naming all consuming nodes and periods. Allocate boat/diving/net service by evidenced use, holding capacity by occupied service-time, presentation equipment and container service by recorded use/turns, and transport by actual leg demand. Record acquisition, replacement, maintenance, actual or justified service-life evidence, idle/failed use and closure; test alternatives when service-life evidence is incomplete, with no standard lifetime imposed. Reusable containers are not new full purchases at every transfer. | |
| `allocation_losses` | mortality, returns and treatment | Actual losses retain their prior resource burden; assign their handling to the causal event and reporting pool, preserve any actual replacement activity, and never reclassify resale/downgrade as waste. Waste receiver service and direct release are mutually distinguished, with upstream waste and foreground treatment counted once. | |

## 8. Foreground Data Collection, Calculation, and Quality Rules

### Data Collection Protocols

| protocol_id | process_id | flow_role | record_type | raw_fields | collection_method | unit | frequency | temporal_coverage | site_scope | aggregation_rule | quality_evidence |
| --- | --- | --- | --- | --- | --- | --- | --- | --- | --- | --- | --- |

| `cp_sorting` | `sorting` | Sorting received animals/water/incidentals, inputs, selected and alternate destinations, waste and returns | Lot destination ledger and measurement | lot/trip; incoming transfer id/state/quantity; instance; count; size/condition; net animal mass; water/incidentals; destination; holding active/bypass evidence; supply/native unit; treatment receiver; substance/medium; stock; period | Match T-CS-A/W/I; measure each animal grade and water/material stream independently; observe incidentals entering sorting; document condition/destination without diagnostic prescriptions; match T-SH or T-SP branch and every alternate handoff | kg; count and each instance native unit retained separately | Every received lot, sorting event and output | Full sorting batch, cleaning and reporting-period stock changes | Actual sorting location and its actual recipients | per 1 kg reference flow | Destination/custody ledger; animal-water-package separation; calibrated measurements; holding-state proof; waste and direct-return distinction |
| `cp_holding` | `holding` | Active bounded holding animals/water, intervention inputs, resulting live/alternate stock and losses | Intervention log, measurement and asset service record | lot; active/bypass/unknown; start/end; before/after live state; T-SH/T-HP; animal count/size/condition/mass; water balance; actual inputs/native units; waste receiver; pollutant/medium/carbon; tank/container use; period/stock/failed batch | Require observed bounded intervention; match T-SH-A/W and T-HP-A/W; measure animal and water changes separately; record only actual resources, services and releases; if bypassed retain evidence without inventing holding inputs or outcomes | kg; duration and each actual instance native unit retained separately | Each actual intervention and transfer | Actual intervention interval and attributable equipment/reporting periods | Actual holding site only when active | per 1 kg reference flow | Time/state records; input invoices/meters; calibrated measurements; separate waste/return records; reuse/service ledger and uncertainty |
| `cp_presentation` | `presentation` | Animals, water, protective materials, presented outputs, alternate products, waste and releases | Presentation batch, package and custody record | lot; actual branch; T-SP/T-HP; animal count/condition/mass; managed/new/purchased water; package material/native unit; single-use/reuse; T-PL; recipient; inputs; waste/treatment; direct substances/medium; service periods | Match actual branch inputs; measure animal mass excluding water/package; measure water and each package separately; document roles, reuse and actual protective state; pair T-PL-A/W/P and each alternate handoff | kg; count and each instance native unit retained separately | Each presentation batch, acquisition/use and transfer | Batch, cleanup, container/service and reporting periods | Actual presentation location and logistics handoff | per 1 kg reference flow | Branch proof; calibrated/tared masses; package identity/reuse and transfer ledger; waste receiver and release records |

Any computed direct release in any node follows the instance-specific formula/factor/source and measured-component requirement in its direct-release card, with calculated_value/calculated_from_collection; only measured releases retain foreground_record/collected_record. No generic fixed emission factor is supplied.

### Calculation Rules

| rule_id | Applies to | Formula or rule | Inputs | Output | source_ids |
| --- | --- | --- | --- | --- | --- |
| `same_lot_reference` | buyer_live_shrimp | Same-lot accepted animal mass A / A = 1 kg; require positive A, identical lot and independent animal-water-package separation. | A; cp_logistics | 1 kg reference flow | same-lot-reference-identity |

All non-reference amounts use actual measured native quantities attributable to the declared lot/period, divided by positive accepted animal mass A to express per 1 kg reference flow, without changing numerator property/unit. Count-to-mass estimates retain same-lot representative sample count/mass and uncertainty; no universal standard mass. Symbolic U_row is an unestablished row/instance-specific upper uncertainty bound needing independent observations. It supplies neither a numeric default nor an empirical typical interval and cannot excuse missing actual records.

### Data Quality Requirements

| requirement_id | Applies to | Requirement | Evidence |
| --- | --- | --- | --- |
| `quality_identity` | reference and actual instances | Confirm species, wild origin, ornamental purpose and live state, trip-specific hand-net SCUBA boat route, exact input/output identity, native flow property and unit before final exchange binding. | Species and trip proof and verified identity details; explicit unresolved gaps |
| `quality_balance` | physical handoffs | Match each named transfer output/input quantity/state/unit exactly; reconcile animal counts and independently measured mass, water, incidentals, package, alternate products, live stock, mortality and returns. | Paired custody records and node balances |
| `quality_state` | holding and receipt | Demonstrate actual bounded holding or evidenced bypass, and first physical buyer custody with live accepted animals; unknown state or invoice-only evidence is incomplete. | Intervention/bypass and physical receipt records |
| `quality_periods` | all processes | Cover all applicable complete trip, batch, transport-leg and reporting periods, including failed/no-output events, both opening and closing stock, acquisition, reuse, shared asset service, cleaning, maintenance, replacement and closure; reconcile one owner ledger. | Period ledgers and applicable asset and service ledgers, attribution rationale and sensitivity |
| `quality_ranges` | every flow card | Establish each actual amount from records separately from symbolic uncertainty. Replace U_row with independently supported site/instance evidence before claiming bounded empirical uncertainty; preserve uncertainty for sample mass and allocation. | Measurements, sample representativeness and evidence tier disclosure |
| `quality_sources` | claims | Literature supports qualitative route/community commerce only; never infer species-specific gear assignment, health procedures, castration, disease guarantee or numerical operating defaults from it. | Source passages and application evidence |
| `collect_capture_operations` | `capture`; Inputs; Product flows | Identify each actual physically or chemically specific exchange within this collection scope and add an independent inventory card; this collection scope is not a flow. Establish substance/species, state, flow type, property, native unit, quantity, evidence, normalization, destination and UUID separately for each card.

Collection scope: Actual boat, diver, net and ancillary supplies or services. For each actual boat fuel, purchased diving-air/compressor service, net, collection container, cleaning supply, energy or complete service, instantiate a separate exchange with its actual material/service identity, property and native unit. Use trip activity and shared-service attribution; a complete service excludes duplicated constituent fuel, electricity, assets and releases. Record each actual opening, received or returned managed live-stock input as its own concrete animal instance with species, wild-origin evidence, live state, Mass/kg and count, receipt/custody, inherited burden and a transfer id paired to the prior closing-stock or return output record. It is not a new wild abstraction; purchased/returned stock alone does not prove this PCR's species-specific capture route or permit bypassing upstream evidence. <br> - Flow property / unit: Actual instance property / actual native unit <br> - Amount rule: Measured actual collect_capture_operations quantity; cp_capture; allocated to the declared reference basis <br> - Value mode: Foreground record (`foreground_record`) <br> - Specificity: Site-specific (`site_specific`) <br> - Normalization basis: per 1 kg reference flow <br> - Basis kind: Reference flow (`reference_flow`) <br> - Evidence kind: Collected record (`collected_record`) <br> - Collection protocol: `cp_capture` <br> - Range: Unestablished instance-specific uncertainty; U_capture_operations requires independent observations, not a universal cap or empirical default <br> - Range role: Uncertainty range (`uncertainty_range`) <br> - Lower: 0 <br> - Upper: U_capture_operations <br> - Unit: instance native unit <br> - Basis: per 1 kg reference flow; each actual instance retains its native property and unit <br> - Basis kind: Reference flow (`reference_flow`) <br> - Evidence kind: Reasoned estimate (`reasoned_estimate`) | Node collection protocol, original records and individual identity, quantity, range and destination evidence |

Do not copy an aggregate quantity, common upper bound or UUID onto its members. Determine final direction and product/waste/elementary type from each actual source and fate; the collection scope does not assign a universal exchange type. Collection scope: Actual transport, handling, replenishment, cleaning and shared services. Instantiate every actual pre-receipt leg/service in its native unit using distance, payload, time, empty return and custody evidence; include buyer-operated or buyer-paid movement before physical receipt. Separately record actual replenishment materials, energy, assets and cleaning where not included in a complete service. Exclude duplicated component fuel, assets and releases of complete transport service. Record each actual opening, received or returned managed live-stock input as its own concrete animal instance with species, wild-origin evidence, live state, Mass/kg and count, receipt/custody, inherited burden and a transfer id paired to the prior closing-stock or return output record. It is not a new wild abstraction; purchased/returned stock alone does not prove this PCR's species-specific capture route or permit bypassing upstream evidence. <br> - Flow property / unit: Actual instance property / actual native unit <br> - Amount rule: Measured actual collect_logistics_operations quantity; cp_logistics; allocated to the declared reference basis <br> - Value mode: Foreground record (`foreground_record`) <br> - Specificity: Site-specific (`site_specific`) <br> - Normalization basis: per 1 kg reference flow <br> - Basis kind: Reference flow (`reference_flow`) <br> - Evidence kind: Collected record (`collected_record`) <br> - Collection protocol: `cp_logistics` <br> - Range: Unestablished instance-specific uncertainty; U_logistics_operations requires independent observations, not a universal cap or empirical default <br> - Range role: Uncertainty range (`uncertainty_range`) <br> - Lower: 0 <br> - Upper: U_logistics_operations <br> - Unit: instance native unit <br> - Basis: per 1 kg reference flow; each actual instance retains its native property and unit <br> - Basis kind: Reference flow (`reference_flow`) <br> - Evidence kind: Reasoned estimate (`reasoned_estimate`) | Node collection protocol, original records and individual identity, quantity, range and destination evidence |

Determine final direction and product/waste/elementary type from each actual source and fate; the collection scope does not assign a universal exchange type. Collection scope: Other intended live grades, resale outputs and retained stock before receipt. Instantiate every alternate live grade/species, resale, returned live lot or retained stock separately with count, measured mass, condition, actual destination and physical custody event. Do not count the same animal at buyer_live_shrimp and an alternate handoff; open stock remains in the period ledger. <br> - Flow property / unit: Actual instance property / actual native unit <br> - Amount rule: Measured actual collect_logistics_alternate_products quantity; cp_logistics; allocated to the declared reference basis <br> - Value mode: Foreground record (`foreground_record`) <br> - Specificity: Site-specific (`site_specific`) <br> - Normalization basis: per 1 kg reference flow <br> - Basis kind: Reference flow (`reference_flow`) <br> - Evidence kind: Collected record (`collected_record`) <br> - Collection protocol: `cp_logistics` <br> - Range: Unestablished instance-specific uncertainty; U_logistics_alternate_products requires independent observations, not a universal cap or empirical default <br> - Range role: Uncertainty range (`uncertainty_range`) <br> - Lower: 0 <br> - Upper: U_logistics_alternate_products <br> - Unit: instance native unit <br> - Basis: per 1 kg reference flow; each actual instance retains its native property and unit <br> - Basis kind: Reference flow (`reference_flow`) <br> - Evidence kind: Reasoned estimate (`reasoned_estimate`) | Node collection protocol, original records and individual identity, quantity, range and destination evidence |

Determine final direction and product/waste/elementary type from each actual source and fate; the collection scope does not assign a universal exchange type. Collection scope: Pre-receipt mortality, damaged materials and wastewater to actual receiver.

Collection scope: Direct returns and individual emissions before buyer receipt. Instantiate actual organism/water returns and each direct pollutant separately with substance, receiving medium, native unit and fossil/biogenic carbon basis. Do not duplicate service-provider fuel emissions when already included in a complete transport service. For a measured release instance retain foreground_record/collected_record. Any computed actual release instance must instead declare calculated_value/calculated_from_collection, its own formula, factor and source, measured component inputs and uncertainty under this node's protocol; no generic fixed factor is supplied. <br> - Flow property / unit: Actual instance property / actual native unit <br> - Amount rule: Measured actual collect_logistics_direct_returns quantity; cp_logistics; allocated to the declared reference basis <br> - Value mode: Foreground record (`foreground_record`) <br> - Specificity: Site-specific (`site_specific`) <br> - Normalization basis: per 1 kg reference flow <br> - Basis kind: Reference flow (`reference_flow`) <br> - Evidence kind: Collected record (`collected_record`) <br> - Collection protocol: `cp_logistics` <br> - Range: Unestablished instance-specific uncertainty; U_logistics_direct_returns requires independent observations, not a universal cap or empirical default <br> - Range role: Uncertainty range (`uncertainty_range`) <br> - Lower: 0 <br> - Upper: U_logistics_direct_returns <br> - Unit: instance native unit <br> - Basis: per 1 kg reference flow; each actual instance retains its native property and unit <br> - Basis kind: Reference flow (`reference_flow`) <br> - Evidence kind: Reasoned estimate (`reasoned_estimate`) | Node collection protocol, original records and individual identity, quantity, range and destination evidence |
| `dq_logistics_water_balance` | logistics, services and water/nutrient balances | Actual payload includes accompanying water, ice, packaging and other cargo. Empty return/repositioning still consumes activity: account for its actual fuel/distance/vehicle service and explicit attribution; zero cargo tonne-kilometres cannot erase that duty. Do not duplicate a complete service and covered fuel, materials, assets or direct releases. Measure external abstraction, supplied water product, internal circulation and actual returned/discharged water separately; never deduct internal recirculation again from external intake. Net nutrient increment/retention is a separate balance diagnostic, never automatically a negative elementary flow, negative emission or avoided burden. | Actual load/vehicle duty records, service scope, same-lot water/substance balance and method evidence |

## 9. Validation Rules

| rule_id | Applies to | Rule | source_ids |
| --- | --- | --- | --- |
| `validate_scope` | reference product | Reject reference animals lacking species/wild/live/ornamental/never-frozen proof, actual selected trip route or first physical local buyer gate. Retain commercial counts and condition independently from kg. | priyashadi-ornamental-trincomalee-2023; un-cpc3-2025 |
| `validate_measurement` | reference and inventory | Require positive accepted same-lot net animal mass A, final A / A = 1 kg, independent water/package/incidentals exclusion, calibrated or traceable mass evidence and native-unit preservation for every instance. No standard shrimp mass. | same-lot-reference-identity |
| `validate_transfers` | process map | Require T-CS-A/W/I, the actual T-SH plus T-HP or evidenced T-SP branch, and T-PL-A/W/P; compare paired quantity/state/unit/owner and every intended alternate handoff, stock and loss. No duplicate final animals or re-abstracted water. | |
| `validate_conditional` | holding | Active requires observed bounded intervention and complete own-node records; bypass requires evidence. Unknown does not equal inactive; missing actual state blocks finalization. | |
| `validate_outputs` | all processes | Enumerate every intended species/grade/resale/stock output separately, distinguish downgrade from waste and incidentals from intended catch, and reconcile mortality, treatment versus direct release and substance/medium/carbon basis. | |
| `validate_attribution` | allocation | Check subdivision, supported causal service demand then documented nonnegative comparable producer-gate net-sales-value fallback (not profit), positive denominator, explicit retained-stock values and exceptional-value justified alternative plus animal-mass sensitivity, all failed periods/stock carryover and shared infrastructure/service life rationale; every event/asset has one owner and no duplicate complete-service constituents. Unsupported attribution stays unresolved. | |
| `validate_coverage` | data package | Missing quantity/identity/holding/receipt/range/period evidence is explicit incomplete coverage. Candidate guidance does not establish verified final exchanges or publication readiness; report performed/skipped checks and gaps. | |
| `validate_atomic_completion` | all applicable per-flow collection obligations and final exchanges | Final dataset completion and validation require every actual exchange to have an independent atomic card and its own quantity, property/native unit, collection or calculation evidence, range/uncertainty evidence, normalization, actual destination and verified UUID. Unknown identity, activity state, quantity, range evidence or fate blocks completion; it is never zero, a presumed bypass or permission to omit an obligation. Every important concrete flow retains its own range/uncertainty evidence collection duty; a symbolic upper bound is not an empirical range. | |
