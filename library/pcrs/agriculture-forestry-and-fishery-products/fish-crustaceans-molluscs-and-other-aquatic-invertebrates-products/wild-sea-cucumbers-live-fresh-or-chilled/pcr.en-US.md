# Wild live eviscerated SCUBA-harvested red sea cucumber

## 1. Scope and Applicability

This category covers Alaska wild Apostichopus californicus (historical Parastichopus californicus), collected by boat-supported SCUBA divers by hand in mesh bags, prepared on the vessel by actual poking/evisceration and draining, and physically received alive and raw by the first shore processor. ADFG describes the route; actual lot records must establish eligibility and quantities. The historical report supports process order only, not present rates, laws, viability guarantees or holding limits.

## 2. Product Category Identity

| Field | Value |
| --- | --- |
| canonical_pcr_id | pcr.agriculture-forestry-and-fishery-products.fish-crustaceans-molluscs-and-other-aquatic-invertebrates-products.wild-sea-cucumbers-live-fresh-or-chilled |
| classification_refs | cpc:3.0:04511 (narrower) |
| covered_products | Alaska wild A. californicus, live eviscerated drained raw never-frozen animal at first shore-processor physical receipt |
| excluded_products | Whole final reference; other species; aquaculture; hookah/surface-supplied or non-SCUBA harvest; ornamental; dead/frozen/salted/cooked/dried products; separated skin/muscle products |
| representative_product | Boat-harvested wild red sea cucumber delivered live after vessel evisceration and draining |
| production_route | SCUBA hand collection → vessel primary conditioning → actual sorting → evidenced preservation or bypass → tote presentation → all logistics → first shore physical receipt |
| market_state | Live, eviscerated, drained, raw and never frozen; native skin and muscle remain together |

## 3. Reference Flow

| Field | Value |
| --- | --- |
| What | Eligible animal at first physical shore-processor receipt |
| How much | 1 kg |
| How well | Observed live, eviscerated, raw, drained and never frozen, excluding viscera, free water, tote and rejects |
| How long or cycle | One traceable accepted lot within declared trip, season and shared-asset service periods, including linked failed trips and opening/closing stock |
| reference_flow_link | `received_live_eviscerated` |

| Field | Value |
| --- | --- |
| Reference amount | 1 |
| Reference product flow | Raw live eviscerated drained red sea cucumber at first physical shore-processor receipt |
| Reference flow property | Mass `93a60a56-a3c8-11da-a746-0800200b9a66` |
| Reference unit group | Units of mass `93a60a57-a4c8-11da-a746-0800200c9a66` |
| Reference unit | kg |
| Required qualifiers | species; wild origin; Alaska location; boat-supported SCUBA; lot/trip/season; actual vessel evisceration; drained-weighing/tare protocol; observed live state at physical receipt; raw never-frozen; skin/muscle unseparated; receiver/time/place; holding intervention or evidenced bypass; reporting/asset periods |

Required qualifiers must appear in foreground package metadata or equivalent traceable records. Define A as the positive accepted net drained eviscerated animal mass at the actual reference gate for the attributable lot/output pool. Only that same-lot reference has A/A=1; internal whole or prepared transfers are measured independently.

## 4. Measurement and Unit Rules

| rule_id | Applies to | Required property | Required unit | Rule |
| --- | --- | --- | --- | --- |
| reference_mass | reference product | Mass `93a60a56-a3c8-11da-a746-0800200b9a66` | kg | A is weighed at physical shore receipt with calibrated scale, recorded tare and reproducible actual drain method, excluding removed viscera, free water, totes and rejected/non-reference outputs; observe live state separately. Whole intake cannot be converted using a default yield. |
| native_units | all inventory rows | Actual instance property | native unit | Keep each source unit (kg, kWh, h, tkm or item-use); document any measured density or count-to-mass conversion and uncertainty. Never replace an energy/service numerator with animal mass. Every inventory amount and range uses per 1 kg reference flow and its own node protocol. |

## 5. System Boundary

### Boundary Abstraction

| Field | Value |
| --- | --- |
| declared_starting_condition | Wild marine A. californicus at recorded Alaska capture location before SCUBA removal; trip preparation and attributable upstream supplies included |
| starting_condition_role | Unmanaged natural biological stock, not a purchased seed or farm growout input |
| product_classification_scope | Narrower live wild sea cucumber state within cpc:3.0:04511; no whole-leaf claim |
| recursive_input_rule | Record actual same-category purchased animal inputs separately with species/origin/state and verified upstream data; no recursive wild growth construction or hidden duplication |
| upstream_dataset_requirement | Verified inventories for actual fuels, air supply, water, energy, materials, assets and complete services at declared boundaries; exclude duplicate components |
| disclosure | Location/species/wild origin; observed route; batch/trip/season and asset periods; actual receipt gate; conditional states; all stock, losses, destinations, allocation and gaps |

| rule_id | Applies to | Rule | source_ids |
| --- | --- | --- | --- |
| scope_gate | product_system | Include Alaska wild A. californicus boat-supported SCUBA hand collection, vessel evisceration/draining, actual sorting, bounded preservation when observed, tote presentation and every logistics leg until first physical shore-processor receipt. Capture removes a whole animal; conditioning makes the reference state. Neither invoices nor vessel ownership ends the boundary. | adfg-dive-sea-cucumber; adfg-walker-dive-fisheries-2006 |
| physical_transfer | all_nodes | T_CC whole animals and T_CM incidental matter pair capture to condition; T_CS prepared animals and T_SM residual incidental matter pair condition to sort; T_SH pairs sort to active hold, then T_HP to present; proven bypass T_SP pairs sort directly to present; T_PD pairs present to deliver. Each identifier has one physical quantity/state/time and paired output/input. Keep lot opening/closing stock and leakage reconciliation; unknown branch is a gap, not bypass. |  |
| period_assets | all_nodes | Use trip/lot batches inside a declared reporting season; enumerate active, failed and no-accepted-output trips, maintenance/cleanup, opening/closing animal stock, tote cycles, vessel/dive/compressor/holding assets, replacement and retirement periods. Link each event and asset to all consuming nodes and service periods; absence of a claimed intervention needs records. Do not prescribe asset lifetimes. |  |
| fate_boundary | all_nodes | Track actual intended animal grades and useful by-products separately at every node. Discarded viscera/body fluid, animal mortality, incidental matter and cleanup require actual destination: treatment waste or identified direct environmental return/release. Returned carrier water is separate from pollutants; purchased water is separate from abstraction. No avoided-burden, restoration or natural-feeding credit is implied. |  |
| outside_gate | downstream | Exclude shore-processor holding and muscle/skin separation after first physical receipt, cooking, drying, freezing and later distribution/use. Existing wild stock growth has no invented aquaculture feed/seed burden; actual purchased same-category animal inputs need separate verified upstream datasets and must not masquerade as this wild-capture reference. | adfg-dive-sea-cucumber |

## 6. Process Inventory Structure

### Process Map

| process_id | process_name | inclusion | inclusion_condition | role | quantitative_reference |
| --- | --- | --- | --- | --- | --- |
| capture | Boat-supported SCUBA hand capture | required | Every included lot | Wild seabed to whole collected animal; independent of later preparation | per 1 kg reference flow |
| condition | Vessel primary evisceration and draining | required | Every included lot undergoes documented poking/evisceration and draining | Collected whole animal to raw live eviscerated drained animal | per 1 kg reference flow |
| sort | Sorting into actual destinations | required | Every included lot | Prepared lot to eligible grade, alternative destinations and discarded matter | per 1 kg reference flow |
| hold | Bounded preservation intervention | conditional | Actual recorded cooling, aeration or managed holding before physical receipt; record bypass only when absence is evidenced | Sorted usable animals to post-intervention usable animals | per 1 kg reference flow |
| present | Reusable tote presentation | required | Every included lot is presented for the selected recipient | Eligible loose animal to identified tote lot; transport is a separate node | per 1 kg reference flow |
| deliver | All pre-receipt logistics and physical shore receipt | required | Every actual movement up to first physical shore-processor receipt | Presented lot to physically received eligible lot | per 1 kg reference flow |

Production mode is trip/lot batch capture, with seasonal and asset-service pools. Logs link every transfer, cleanup, changeover, failed batch and stock event to a node and period. No mandatory storage is inserted merely for elapsed transit time. Each applicable Section 8 collection obligation becomes zero, one or multiple actual exchanges with its own identity, unit, amount, fate and U bound; unknown actual activity cannot be set to zero.

###### Raw live eviscerated drained red sea cucumber at first physical shore-processor receipt (`received_live_eviscerated`)

Actual reference output: accepted net drained animal mass A at physical receipt, observed alive, eviscerated, raw and never frozen; before skin/muscle separation. Exclude viscera, free water, tote and all rejected/other-destination animals.

Calculated from the same measured accepted mass: A/A = 1 kg per 1 kg reference flow, using `cp_deliver`; the normalized quantity is not a raw weighing record.

## 7. Allocation and Co-product Handling

| rule_id | Applies to | Rule | source_ids |
| --- | --- | --- | --- |
| subdivision | intended_outputs | First subdivide directly measured node, leg and lot burdens. For inseparable shared capture/conditioning burdens among animal grades, assign by measured same-state animal mass; never compare whole intake with eviscerated output without the measured material balance. Useful viscera or other unlike products require an explicit justified causal rule; if unavailable use documented contemporaneous net revenue shares at the actual handoff and test sensitivity against mass attribution where physically meaningful. No output is presumed valuable. |  |
| period_attribution | reporting_season | Carry actual failed trips/batches, mortality, unsuccessful delivery, idle capacity, stock and cleanup through the declared season/service pool. Assign direct events to their lots; allocate unavoidable common trip/season burdens to supported intended outputs, with open stock carrying attributable burden forward. Do not divide zero-output periods by zero or drop them; link them to the supported service period and test that linkage. Reconcile opening plus additions minus outputs/losses equals closing stock by state. |  |
| shared_service | assets_and_services | List vessel, deck, bags, SCUBA cylinders, compressor, holding equipment, scales and totes with all consuming nodes and periods. Attribute measured operating burden by logged use, load or causal service, and embodied/replacement/retirement burden by evidenced total service throughput with explicit remaining-life assumptions and sensitivity. One asset/event owner reconciles shares to 100%; complete purchased service excludes its component fuel/electricity/assets/releases. Do not double count reusable tote manufacture at return. |  |
| no_credit | waste_and_returns | Assign waste handling and actual releases to their generating lot/service; reusable returns are service loops. No substitution credit for live returns, recovered viscera, discarded organic material or seawater is allowed by this PCR. Report allocation method, denominator and counterfactual sensitivity separately from observed exchanges. |  |

For every actual direct release, retain foreground_record/collected_record only for a measured release. If the quantity is derived from fuel, concentrations, carbon composition or another activity record, use calculated_value/calculated_from_collection for that resolved instance and retain its explicit formula, factor/source, measured inputs, substance/medium basis and uncertainty under its own collection protocol. The collection-obligation template does not certify a calculated release as measured; no universal emission factor is supplied.

### Calculation Rules

| rule_id | Applies to | Formula or rule | Inputs | Output | source_ids |
| --- | --- | --- | --- | --- | --- |
| normalise_lot | all inventory rows | For each row/instance divide its attributable native-unit quantity by positive A from cp_deliver; final accepted animal mass divided by itself is 1. Preserve native numerator units and independent internal transfer amounts. For derived direct releases, establish the raw release quantity and evidence under release_evidence_mode before this division. | attributable quantity; A; cp_deliver | quantity per 1 kg reference flow | mass-balance-identity |
| balance_and_attribution | all inventory rows | Reconcile animal whole/eviscerated states and separately all water, incidental matter and removed viscera; opening stock plus receipts equals intended outputs plus waste/direct returns/releases plus closing stock, allowing only documented measurement uncertainty. Allocate period/assets by declared causal service or supported output shares before division by A. | node ledgers; stock; transfers; service shares | closed balances and attributable quantities | mass-balance-identity |
| release_evidence_mode | condition_water_return; collect_capture_air_releases; collect_condition_marine_releases; collect_sort_returns; collect_hold_releases; collect_present_releases; collect_delivery_releases | For each actual direct-release instance, retain foreground_record/collected_record only when the raw release quantity is directly measured. If derived from fuel, concentrations, carbon composition or another activity record, use calculated_value/calculated_from_collection for that instance. Under its own collection protocol retain the explicit formula, factor and source/version where applicable, measured input records, substance/receiving-medium basis and uncertainty. Apply the stated attribution and reference-flow normalization once. Resolve the evidence branch before finalizing; missing method or supporting evidence remains incomplete, not zero. Existing foreground/collected metadata is the measured-branch template, not certification of calculated releases; no universal emission factor is supplied. | Instance-specific measured records; formula and factor/source/version if calculated; node protocol; attribution and accepted A | Release instance with method-consistent value/evidence metadata and traceable quantity | |

Collection scope: Other intended delivered or retained lots and tote returns. Instantiate each actual non-reference intended sale/use lot, viable refused/redestined lot, open animal stock and reusable tote return with own state, quantity, receiver and date. Loss of reference eligibility alone is not disposal. <br> - Flow property / unit: Actual instance property / kg; item <br> - Amount rule: Each actual intended animal mass or reusable item return / A <br> - Value mode: `foreground_record` <br> - Specificity: `site_specific` <br> - Normalization basis: per 1 kg reference flow <br> - Basis kind: `reference_flow` <br> - Evidence kind: `collected_record` <br> - Collection protocol: `cp_deliver` <br> - Range: Evidence-gap interval; U_delivery_other_products must be established for each actual instance; not an empirical range, universal cap or substitute for collection <br> - Range role: `qa_guardrail` <br> - Lower: 0 <br> - Upper: U_delivery_other_products <br> - Unit: kg; item <br> - Basis: per 1 kg reference flow <br> - Basis kind: `reference_flow` <br> - Evidence kind: `reasoned_estimate` | Node collection protocol, original records and individual identity, quantity, range and destination evidence |

| `dq_logistics_water_balance` | logistics, services and water/nutrient balances | Actual payload includes accompanying water, ice, packaging and other cargo. Empty return/repositioning still consumes activity: account for its actual fuel/distance/vehicle service and explicit attribution; zero cargo tonne-kilometres cannot erase that duty. Do not duplicate a complete service and covered fuel, materials, assets or direct releases. Measure external abstraction, supplied water product, internal circulation and actual returned/discharged water separately; never deduct internal recirculation again from external intake. Net nutrient increment/retention is a separate balance diagnostic, never automatically a negative elementary flow, negative emission or avoided burden. | Actual load/vehicle duty records, service scope, same-lot water/substance balance and method evidence |

## 9. Validation Rules

| rule_id | Applies to | Rule | source_ids |
| --- | --- | --- | --- |
| eligible_reference | reference_output | Verify A>0, species and wild Alaska SCUBA origin, observed live status at actual first physical shore-processor receipt, eviscerated raw never-frozen state, scale/tare/drain method and pre-separation gate. Any dead, whole, frozen or skin/muscle-only output is ineligible for A, though its burdens and fate remain accounted. | adfg-dive-sea-cucumber |
| reconcile_transfers | all_nodes | Reconcile every paired transfer by lot, state, time and quantity; prove the holding activation/bypass state, account for incidental matter and free water, enumerate all intended destinations and distinguish treatment from direct release. Reject unexplained mass losses and duplicate final/internal exchanges. Unknown actual conditions remain incomplete rather than zero. |  |
| complete_reporting_pool | season_and_assets | Reconcile all trip/season inputs, failed batches, mortality, stocks, shared assets, tote cycles, replacement/retirement and cleanup with output allocation and sensitivity. Each complete service has a documented component-exclusion map; shares reconcile and no discarded material earns a credit. |  |
| identities_and_ranges | all_rows | Verify each final exchange concrete flow/property/unit against actual identity and role. collection scope rows must expand into actual instances; no inferred top-hit identity or generic pollutant match. Symbolic 0..U intervals explicitly lack empirical bounds; collect row/instance-specific observations and uncertainty before final data production. Checker pass does not establish identity verification or publication readiness. |  |
| `validate_atomic_completion` | all applicable per-flow collection obligations and final exchanges | Final dataset completion and validation require every actual exchange to have an independent atomic card and its own quantity, property/native unit, collection or calculation evidence, range/uncertainty evidence, normalization, actual destination and verified UUID. Unknown identity, activity state, quantity, range evidence or fate blocks completion; it is never zero, a presumed bypass or permission to omit an obligation. Every important concrete flow retains its own range/uncertainty evidence collection duty; a symbolic upper bound is not an empirical range. | |
