# Farmed whole head-on chilled pond whiteleg shrimp

## 1. Scope and Applicability

This PCR covers Peru Tumbes semi-intensive coastal brackish earthen-pond Penaeus vannamei grown from purchased hatchery postlarvae and actually harvested by outlet bag-net draining, with actual whole-product washing followed by independent grading/sorting and ice-water killing/chilling, delivered as raw head-on shell-on never-frozen chilled whole shrimp at first processor physical acceptance before deheading or freezing. FAO 2009 supports the listed handling operations but describes sorting before washing; it does not substantiate the washing-before-independent-grading order selected here. FAO 2025 corroborates the local industry without proving each farm operation. This PCR selects a narrow conditional route, not a claim that this order is established local practice. Actual farm, operation-order and handoff records must establish eligibility under b_route_evidence. This is a product-system methodological boundary with no prescribed density, feed conversion ratio, yield, crop duration, temperature threshold, additive/drug or dose.

| What | Accepted whole raw head-on shell-on chilled pond whiteleg shrimp at first processor physical receipt before deheading/freezing. |
| How much | 1 kg accepted net whole product excluding free ice/water and packaging tare. |
| How well | Declare species, hatchery batch, semi-intensive brackish earthen-pond site, actual harvest method, head/shell retention, never-frozen state, actual grade/lot acceptance and first-recipient gate; this PCR sets no food safety or grade threshold. |
| How long or cycle | Link preparation/fallow, stocking, growout, harvest, between-crop cleaning, chilling/holding, transport and receipt dates; include failed crops and asset installation, repair, replacement and termination over declared reporting periods. |

| Reference amount | 1 |
| Reference product flow | Accepted raw whole head-on shell-on never-frozen chilled whiteleg shrimp at first processor physical receipt |
| Reference flow property | Mass `93a60a56-a3c8-11da-a746-0800200b9a66` |
| Reference unit group | Units of mass `93a60a57-a4c8-11da-a746-0800200c9a66` |
| Reference unit | kg |
| Required qualifiers | Penaeus vannamei/synonym; Peru Tumbes farm/site and brackish source; semi-intensive earthen-pond mode; purchased hatchery postlarval batch/stage; actual outlet bag-net draining harvest evidence; crop/reporting periods and failed cycles; whole raw dead head-on shell-on never-frozen chilled state; actual size/grade; accepted net mass/free-ice-water/tare method; actual wash/sort sequence and chilling records; packaging activation/custody/reuse; actual first processor receipt location/date before deheading/freezing; upstream dataset and service ownership; allocation and exclusions. |

Declare every required qualifier in foreground package metadata or equivalent fields; any missing qualifier makes the reference definition incomplete. The denominator is kg whole shrimp, not count, edible flesh, iced box gross weight or headed-shrimp mass.

## 4. Measurement and Unit Rules

| rule_id | Applies to | Required property | Required unit | Rule |
| --- | --- | --- | --- | --- |
| `reference_mass` | reference product | Mass | kg | Use calibrated same-lot receipt weighing; A = accepted net whole-shrimp mass after free ice/water and packaging tare correction. Retain head, organs and native shell; do not convert to edible flesh or live body weight. |
| `native_instances` | all inventory rows | Actual instance property | native unit | Use each actual instance's verified property and native unit; count-to-mass, volume-to-mass, nutrient/active-to-product or energy conversions need matched measured composition/density/individual mass or documented supplier factors. Do not sum incompatible units. |
| `biological_reconciliation` | pond and harvest transfers | Mass | kg | Reconcile seed counts, growth, mortality, escapes, standing biomass estimates, harvested mass, grades and final accepted mass without imposing input-output body-mass equality. Water, feed, sludge and live/chilled shrimp use their own declared basis. |

## 5. System Boundary

### Boundary Abstraction

| Field | Value |
| --- | --- |
| declared_starting_condition | Purchased hatchery postlarvae physically received for stocking, existing coastal brackish earthen pond and declared prior land/pond history; source-batch and preparation records required. |
| starting_condition_role | Foreground entry, not a zero-burden origin: seed carries hatchery, transport and prior biological production upstream; pond land/assets carry declared history and period attribution. |
| product_classification_scope | One species/route/state/gate semantic subset; broader external leaf does not authorize another shrimp species or live/frozen state. |
| recursive_input_rule | A same-species shrimp input is still an evidenced seed or transfer lot with its own prior gate; attach the upstream dataset once and terminate recursion at the disclosed acquisition boundary. Do not reuse this final-product PCR as a zero-burden hatchery. |
| upstream_dataset_requirement | Identify provider, geography, technology, period, gate, property/unit, background coverage and exclusions for seed, feeds, management materials, energy, water, ice, capital, packaging and external services; unresolved upstream coverage prevents finalization. |
| disclosure | Disclose farm/crops/failed duty, route eligibility, actual operation sequence and optional packaging bypass, product handoffs, resource sources, releases/fates, capital life/history, service ownership, allocation evidence, unmeasured quantities and unresolved identities. |

### Boundary Rules

| rule_id | Applies to | Rule | source_ids |
| --- | --- | --- | --- |
| `b_route` | route | Require foreground proof of hatchery seed, Tumbes brackish semi-intensive earthen-pond mode and actual outlet bag-net drain harvest. FAO's global technical description and Peru corroboration alone do not prove any farm's harvest configuration. | `fao-whiteleg-shrimp-2009`; `fao-peru-shrimp-2025` |
| `b_route_evidence` | route_eligibility | Before treating a lot as eligible or finalizing its foreground dataset, obtain the named farm/crop and lot-linked operation log: actual wash and independent sorting event ids, start/end times, incoming/outgoing state and measured mass, paired handoff ids and responsible-operator confirmation. Show that washing precedes independent grading for this lot. FAO 2009 instead describes sorting before washing; neither cited FAO source proves the selected local order. An unknown order is incomplete eligibility, not an assumed match. A contrary order is outside this selected route and requires methodology review; never relabel an actual grading operation as incidental removal to force a match. | `fao-whiteleg-shrimp-2009`; `fao-peru-shrimp-2025` |
| `b_nodes` | foreground | Separate managed production, physical harvest, whole-product washing, grading, killing/chilling, conditional packaging and delivery/receipt responsibilities. Match all physical transfers; the selected washing-before-independent-grading order applies only when evidenced under b_route_evidence, with early visual removal of incidental material owned by harvest. Another node ordering requires methodology review. No deheading, peeling, cooking or freezing is included before reference receipt. |  |
| `b_periods` | crop_and_assets | Include preparation/fallow, seed receipt/stocking, all growout and harvest attempts, crop failures, idle/cleaning/changeover, actual holding and delivery over declared periods. Include land occupation/history, pond/levee, pumps, aerators, nets, chill equipment, boxes and vehicles with installation, service life, maintenance, replacement and termination ownership. |  |
| `b_services` | ownership | For each node/period, choose full supplier service or separately owned materials/fuels/electricity/assets/direct releases for that same activity; prohibit overlap. Shared pumps, generators, chill facilities, boxes and vehicles must identify all consumers and use once-only attribution. Onsite electricity already represented by fuel/assets/releases is an internal transfer. |  |
| `b_fates` | environment | Classify every intended sale product, downgraded lot, returned product, mortality, escape, incidental animal, sludge, wastewater and discarded material by actual fate. Direct measured/modelled pollutant substance/basis/medium is elementary; treatment transfer is waste with treatment upstream/downstream ownership. Never turn biomass disposal into automatic elemental emissions, burden-free input or ecological credit. |  |
| `b_gate` | reference_gate | End at first processor physical acceptance before deheading/freezing; include all actual transport and cold-chain through that gate, regardless of producer/buyer/service-provider legal ownership; declare the model owner and supplier-service coverage to avoid duplicates. A farm dispatch invoice alone is not physical acceptance evidence. Packaging bypass transfers chilled product directly; one final accepted output only. |  |

| --- | --- | --- | --- | --- | --- |
| `pond` | Pond preparation and semi-intensive growout | required | Within this eligible route | Purchased hatchery postlarvae to standing harvest-ready live whole shrimp in coastal brackish earthen ponds; preparation, fallow, stocking, growout, mortality and crop termination are crop-indexed. | per 1 kg reference flow |
| `harvest` | Outlet bag-net draining harvest | required | Within this eligible route | Standing pond stock to collected live whole shrimp at wash handoff; drainage and physical removal are independently metered, without repeating growout. | per 1 kg reference flow |
| `wash` | Actual whole-product washing | required | Within this eligible route | Collected whole shrimp to washed whole shrimp at sorter; record actual washing-before-independent-grading sequence and wash-water ownership. | per 1 kg reference flow |
| `sort` | Whole-product grading and destination sorting | required | Within this eligible route | Washed whole shrimp to selected chilled-channel lot and each other sale-grade/destination or waste output; no invented grade thresholds. | per 1 kg reference flow |
| `chill` | Ice-water killing, chilling and holding | required | Within this eligible route | Selected whole shrimp to raw dead head-on shell-on never-frozen chilled whole shrimp; include holding and ice top-ups only before dispatch; receipt owns transit cold-chain and transit top-ups. | per 1 kg reference flow |
| `pack` | Actual package loading and presentation | conditional | Include only when the producer loads an actual protective container before dispatch | Chilled whole shrimp to container-protected same product at dispatch; bulk/unpacked physical handoff bypasses this node. | per 1 kg reference flow |
| `receipt` | Delivery and first processor physical receipt | required | Within this eligible route | Measured chilled dispatch lot, packaged or bulk, to accepted net whole shrimp at first processor receipt before deheading or freezing; include actual transit. | per 1 kg reference flow |

Production mode is indexed by pond crop and actual harvest/handling batches, including preparation, fallow, cleaning/changeover, failed and nonproductive duty. This eligible route requires whole-product washing before independent grading/sorting; early visual incidental-material removal belongs to harvest, and another order needs review. A shared event requires one event id and one burden owner. Match node inputs, outputs and fates through transfer ids. Packaging is conditional: when inactive, chilled output passes directly to delivery; unknown activation is not an inactive default.

### Process: Pond preparation and semi-intensive growout (`pond`)

Purchased hatchery postlarvae to standing harvest-ready live whole shrimp in coastal brackish earthen ponds; preparation, fallow, stocking, growout, mortality and crop termination are crop-indexed.

#### Inputs

##### Product flows

###### Purchased hatchery whiteleg shrimp postlarvae received at farm before stocking (`hatchery_postlarvae`)

Record the actual hatchery batch, postlarval stage and physically received count, separately from purchased/dispatched, stocked and dead/lost counts. Retain received seed that dies before stocking and declare upstream transport-loss ownership; never model only stocking survivors. Attach hatchery and seed-delivery upstream datasets once. Count is primary; any kg conversion needs this received batch's representative measured mean individual mass.

## 7. Allocation and Co-product Handling

| rule_id | Applies to | Rule | source_ids |
| --- | --- | --- | --- |
| `a_direct` | all_outputs | First subdivide by measured crop, operation, grade, destination and exclusive equipment/service. Assign seed/feed/pond management to its crop, washing/sorting/chilling to actually treated lots and transport to actually carried lots; identify every sale product and handoff before residual allocation. |  |
| `a_residual` | joint_shrimp_lots | For inseparable residual burdens of one pond crop or joint sorting event, allocate across intended shrimp sale lots by measured whole wet mass at a common pre-divergence handoff, excluding free water/ice and tare. Retain grade/state-specific masses and justify biomass production/handling causality; test realized first-sale revenue shares as sensitivity when grades differ materially in price. Do not use final accepted mass to disguise omitted other products. |  |
| `a_failure` | periods | Include nonproductive/failed crop and maintenance duty in the declared reporting-window pond burden pool; attribute to the same pond's intended sale output over that window using the residual rule. Disclose failure timing and reasons. If no intended sale output exists, retain an unnormalized failed-operation record and widen only an evidenced reporting window; never divide by zero or delete failed duty. |  |
| `a_assets` | shared_assets | For shared infrastructure enumerate pond, harvest, wash, sort, chill, pack and receipt consumers actually using each asset over its service periods. Prefer meters for energy/water; use measured pump hydraulic work or equipment-hours for residual operation, occupied pond-area-time for pond land/levees, and loaded tonne-kilometres with assigned empty/return travel for vehicle services. Allocate capital/repair using documented actual lifetime service shares, including replacement/termination; once-only ledger reconciles all shares. |  |
| `a_waste` | losses | Retain mortality, rejected/discarded biomass and associated treatment within the responsible crop/node burden pool; assign actual treatment once. Other intended products remain products; no automatic substitution/ecological credits. Receipt rejection/return fate keeps its original burden ownership; no default zero-burden replacement. Reprocessing or return-to-upstream loops are outside this declared route; an actual loop requires methodology review before inclusion. |  |

## 8. Foreground Data Collection, Calculation, and Quality Rules

### Data Collection Protocols

Every protocol collects actual native-unit quantities before attribution under section 7 and division by the same accepted receipt mass A. Do not sum incompatible units or divide a failed-only period by zero. Each protocol owns exactly its named process; repeated methods preserve single ownership of shared events.

### Calculation Rules

| rule_id | Applies to | Formula or rule | Inputs | Output | source_ids |
| --- | --- | --- | --- | --- | --- |
| `normalize_lot` | all inventory rows | Divide each once-attributed actual native-unit exchange by accepted net whole-shrimp receipt mass A from cp_receipt; keep product transfers and other-sale outputs independently measured. For the final accepted lot A/A = 1 kg per 1 kg reference flow. | native instance amount; attribution shares; A; cp_receipt | per 1 kg reference flow | `same-lot-normalization` |
| `seed_conversion` | `hatchery_postlarvae` | When a kg exchange is required, multiply actual received postlarval count by that received batch's representative measured mean individual mass in kg; retain separate purchased/dispatched, received, stocked and dead/lost counts, sample statistics and stage. Seed that dies after receipt before stocking remains an input with separately recorded fate; upstream transport losses retain declared upstream ownership. No generic seed weight, survivor-only input or seed-to-harvest mass equality is allowed. | actual received count; measured received-batch mean individual mass; cp_pond | seed mass with count and uncertainty |  |
| `release_loads` | all inventory rows | Derive each actual unmeasured release only from a stated chemical basis and measured activity with a documented applicable factor/model, or concentration and actual water volume; state background versus direct ownership. Keep each pollutant/medium separate and exclude separately listed fossil CO2 from other-release totals. | measured activity or concentration/volume; factor provenance; node protocol | actual substance-specific release in native unit |  |

### Data Quality Requirements

Do not copy an aggregate quantity, common upper bound or UUID onto its members. Determine final direction and product/waste/elementary type from each actual source and fate; the collection scope does not assign a universal exchange type. Collection scope: Actual transit or receipt waste transferred to treatment or disposal. Only actual treatment/disposal transfers belong here: record discarded rejected shrimp, transferred meltwater and damaged materials separately with quantity basis and actual recipient/destination. Direct carrier water stays in the water balance and actual pollutant substance/basis/medium in receipt release cards; meltwater is not automatically waste. Do not relabel returned saleable lots as waste. <br> - Flow property / unit: Actual instance property / native unit <br> - Amount rule: Collect each actual instance amount for this row with `cp_receipt`, attribute once under section 7, and divide by the same accepted net receipt mass A; retain its native unit and measurement/model evidence. <br> - Value mode: Calculated value (`calculated_value`) <br> - Specificity: Site-specific (`site_specific`) <br> - Normalization basis: per 1 kg reference flow <br> - Basis kind: Reference flow (`reference_flow`) <br> - Evidence kind: Calculated from collection (`calculated_from_collection`) <br> - Collection protocol: `cp_receipt` <br> - Range: Provisional unresolved evidence marker; independent upper bound required; no empirical range, default or hard limit <br> - Range role: Uncertainty range (`uncertainty_range`) <br> - Lower: 0 <br> - Upper: U_instance <br> - Unit: native unit <br> - Basis: per 1 kg reference flow; each actual instance has an independent U_instance, never mixed-unit totals <br> - Basis kind: Reference flow (`reference_flow`) <br> - Evidence kind: Reasoned estimate (`reasoned_estimate`) | Node collection protocol, original records and individual identity, quantity, range and destination evidence |

| `dq_logistics_water_balance` | logistics, services and water/nutrient balances | Actual payload includes accompanying water, ice, packaging and other cargo. Empty return/repositioning still consumes activity: account for its actual fuel/distance/vehicle service and explicit attribution; zero cargo tonne-kilometres cannot erase that duty. Do not duplicate a complete service and covered fuel, materials, assets or direct releases. Measure external abstraction, supplied water product, internal circulation and actual returned/discharged water separately; never deduct internal recirculation again from external intake. Net nutrient increment/retention is a separate balance diagnostic, never automatically a negative elementary flow, negative emission or avoided burden. | Actual load/vehicle duty records, service scope, same-lot water/substance balance and method evidence |
| `dq_atomic_card_identity` | all inventory rows | Each card represents one physically identified exchange, not a collection or selector. Keep Electricity as one electrical-energy flow; supplier, geography and voltage remain actual collected qualifiers, not grounds for speculative splitting. Other actual materials, waste streams, carbon origins and receiving media must have separate identities and atomic cards before completion. Preserve every existing collection obligation; an absent card or unresolved identity never means zero or a waived exchange. Paired internal water transfers retain the same actual quality, transfer id, quantity and upstream burden, without another purchase. | Per-card identity, provider, state, destination and paired records |
| `dq_atomic_range_evidence` | repaired atomic flow cards | U_row is an unresolved evidence requirement, not a numerical estimate, default, clipping limit or completeness pass. Establish each card's own matching-unit/reference-basis upper envelope from independent representative records or a compatible documented supplier/design bound, retaining scope, method and uncertainty. Do not reuse a removed aggregate range, copy a sibling quantity, derive a bound from the target batch itself or invent a value. Applicable missing evidence blocks quantitative QA completion; actual measurements remain required. | Independent envelope evidence; retained raw records and uncertainty |

## 9. Validation Rules

| rule_id | Applies to | Rule | source_ids |
| --- | --- | --- | --- |
| `v_scope` | eligibility | Check species/synonym, actual hatchery postlarvae and semi-intensive Tumbes brackish earthen-pond/outlet bag-net route against records; another route or final state requires another methodology or explicit review. |  |
| `v_reference` | reference | Require one accepted_whole_shrimp final output, matching reference name and same-lot denominator A > 0 at first processor receipt; free ice/water and tare excluded, head/organs/shell included, never frozen and before deheading/freezing documented. |  |
| `v_transfer` | node_links | Reconcile every node transfer id, crop/event/date, state and own quantity. Require the paired cp_wash/cp_sort lot-linked records specified by b_route_evidence to verify washing-before-independent-grading; missing or unknown sequence evidence prevents eligibility completion. Check packaging activation or bypass; early incidental removal remains harvest-owned. Do not impose seed/live/chilled/final mass equality; explain losses, other grades, rejection/returns and measurement uncertainty. |  |
| `v_ownership` | completeness | Review all crop phases including failed/nonproductive duty, utilities/materials, land/history, assets/replacement, service coverage and direct combustion/leakage/discharge by node. Check every shared consumer, period and burden ledger for omissions/duplicates; exclude separately listed fossil CO2 from other-release instances. |  |
| `v_native` | quantity_and_identity | Each applicable collection obligation expands into zero, one or multiple actual native-unit instances with independent identity, verified support and quantity evidence. A missing actual substance/provider/gate/property/unit is unresolved, never a generic fixed UUID; final TIDAS exchanges require concrete verified identities. |  |
| `v_ranges` | range_evidence | All 0..U_row/U_instance ranges below are provisional unresolved evidence markers with independently determined upper bounds, not empirical ranges, zero defaults or hard validation limits. For multi-formulation or multi-lot rows, each actual formulation/lot independently owns its U_row upper bound, including U_formulated_feed; there is no shared cap or mixed-identity total. Replace with reviewed data; exact 1..1 applies only to same accepted-lot A/A normalization. | `same-lot-normalization` |
| `v_disclosure` | finalization | Disclose performed/skipped checks, uncertainty, source age/applicability, unresolved quantities/identities, output allocation rationale/sensitivity and all qualifiers. Checker pass does not verify UUID detail or prove publication readiness; unresolved reference/support identities block final concrete datasets. |  |
| `validate_atomic_completion` | all applicable per-flow collection obligations and final exchanges | Final dataset completion and validation require every actual exchange to have an independent atomic card and its own quantity, property/native unit, collection or calculation evidence, range/uncertainty evidence, normalization, actual destination and verified UUID. Unknown identity, activity state, quantity, range evidence or fate blocks completion; it is never zero, a presumed bypass or permission to omit an obligation. Every important concrete flow retains its own range/uncertainty evidence collection duty; a symbolic upper bound is not an empirical range. | |
