# Farmed live in-shell food oysters at first producer handover

## 1. Scope and Applicability

This rule covers food oysters alive in their own native shell within one declared producer operating unit, from actual seed entry through owned managed grow-out and independent harvest to first producer handover. Include only actual pre-gate producer-responsible conditioning, depuration, live holding and presentation, not a recipe inferred from classification. Each package declares actual species, site, cohorts, season and responsibility. Natural marine nutrition is not free hatchery algal feed; “no feed in farming” is not a rule for every controlled stage.

## 4. Measurement and Unit Rules

| rule_id | Applies to | Required property | Required unit | Rule |
| --- | --- | --- | --- | --- |
| `reference_live_mass` | reference product | Mass `93a60a56-a3c8-11da-a746-0800200b9a66` | kg | Use a calibrated scale at handover for net oyster mass, subtract packaging, external substrate/fouling and free water/ice, retaining native shell/tissues/natural body fluids; use cp_dispatch_mass. Only accepted live oysters enter the reference, whose final row is 1 kg. |
| `stage_count_mass` | all seed and stock mass rows | Mass `93a60a56-a3c8-11da-a746-0800200b9a66` | kg | Counts, size and ploidy are separate records, not mass. Convert counts using representative weighed samples and error of matching species, stage, state and cohort; exclude external attached shell and use no adult meat yield or historical larval weight. |
| `water_mass` | water and water carriers | Mass `93a60a56-a3c8-11da-a746-0800200b9a66` | kg | Convert volume with actual salinity, temperature and density evidence; distinguish recirculation, new abstraction, external supply, carriers, discharge and stock without a universal density. |
| `energy_units` | energy inputs | Net calorific value `93a60a56-a3c8-11da-a746-0800200c9a66` | MJ | Preserve actual carrier and supply state; verified unit group gives 1 kWh = 3.6 MJ; do not replace fuel mass by energy without corresponding actual calorific value. |

## 5. System Boundary

### Boundary Abstraction

| Field | Value |
| --- | --- |
| declared_starting_condition | Actual owned wild-spat collection or early-life entry, or actual handover stage of purchased eggs/larvae/spat/seed carrying matching upstream burden |
| starting_condition_role | cohort-, stage- and responsibility-specific foreground entry, not a zero-burden assumption for absent stages |
| product_classification_scope | narrower live native-shell food first-handover subset of CPC 04422 |
| recursive_input_rule | Same-category oyster seed/broodstock inputs retain actual upstream stage and identity; stop recursive expansion without deleting existing burden. Internal returns carry the same cohort stock, not a new purchase or second production. |
| upstream_dataset_requirement | Upstream data matching supplier stage, species, location, transport carrier, substrate and responsibility; disclose gaps/substitutes/uncertainty, never default zero |
| disclosure | Cohort-specific actual stages/bypasses, parent technology deltas, one gate, periods/asset service, live net mass, purchase burdens, depuration responsibility and acceptance limitations |

### Boundary Rules

| rule_id | Applies to | Rule | source_ids |
| --- | --- | --- | --- |
| `boundary_entry` | applicable nodes and complete foreground package | Include actual owned stages from wild-spat collection or owned broodstock/egg/larval entry, or purchase at its documented stage, through managed grow-out, separate harvest and first producer handover. Purchased eyed larvae enter settlement; purchased settled spat enter actual nursery or directly grow-out; purchased grow-out-ready seed bypasses collection/hatchery/settlement/nursery that did not happen. No purchase is burden-free. | `farmed-oyster-foreground-method`; `fao-oyster-production` |
| `boundary_live` | applicable nodes and complete foreground package | Only the final living in-native-shell food oyster mass qualifies. External attached cultch, biofouling, sediments, free water, coolant and packaging are excluded; native shell, tissue and naturally retained body fluids stay included. Dead, shucked, frozen/cooked, pearl/shell-only, final seed and wild adult products are outside this category. | `farmed-oyster-foreground-method`; `un-cpc-3-oysters` |
| `boundary_route` | applicable nodes and complete foreground package | Managed biological parents are algal culture, hatchery/settlement/nursery and grow-out. Wild-spat and hatchery-origin cohorts are alternative entry routes, not two supplies for one animal. Bottom/off-bottom/suspended technology deltas belong to growout and actual collection/harvest techniques to their own parents. Record actual changes in equipment, energy, substrate, water, loss, monitoring and stock bookkeeping; technologies coexist only with disjoint sublots or explicit periods. | `farmed-oyster-foreground-method`; `fao-oyster-production` |
| `boundary_handoffs` | applicable nodes and complete foreground package | Connect harvest, conditioning, grading, depuration and live_holding in actual event order, not the table order. Each revisit has distinct event_id/pass_id/transfer_id; an intake receives only its immediately preceding actual transfer in the same cohort/state and measured amount. Preserve pending grade, accepted grade, pending treatment and actual release qualifiers. At least one actual grading event and first-gate acceptance must be completed; pending required treatment or unknown state cannot be final accepted food mass. Bypasses invent no resources and revisited nodes repeat neither historic burden nor the same event; record an actual new grading event if a later intervention requires reinspection. | `farmed-oyster-foreground-method` |
| `boundary_depuration` | applicable nodes and complete foreground package | Washing/desanding and sanitary depuration/relaying are different responsibilities. Include only actual producer-responsible pre-gate treatment and its applicable authorization, release evidence, water, energy, consumables, effluents and losses. Unknown treatment responsibility or acceptance is unresolved, not automatic bypass. If actual first gate precedes independent buyer treatment, exclude buyer treatment and disclose restrictions; the PCR does not certify safety or universal toxin removal. | `farmed-oyster-foreground-method`; `fda-nssp-context` |
| `boundary_inputs` | applicable nodes and complete foreground package | Purchased stage inputs need upstream datasets at matching species, stage, carrier/substrate, geography and burden boundary. Own algal production and supply are a paired internal chain, not purchased feed plus duplicate own burden. Open-water natural phytoplankton is an environmental biological contribution, not a fabricated purchased feed; hatchery/controlled nursery feed and fertilization remain actual inputs. | `farmed-oyster-foreground-method` |
| `boundary_secondary` | applicable nodes and complete foreground package | Recovered shell cultch is secondary material because it crosses from a prior shell-producing/recovery system. Declare origin and its recovery/cleaning/transport handoff, retained burdens versus explicitly justified cut-off, and count collection/preparation in exactly one system. Do not assume free shell or include external shell in live oyster reference mass. | `farmed-oyster-foreground-method` |
| `boundary_services` | applicable nodes and complete foreground package | Use one declared producer operating unit with batch/cohort and reporting-period indices. Include attributable boats, pumps, tanks, racks, depuration/holding and dispatch assets, cleaning/changeovers, repairs and retirement. For external service use its actual quantity/property and invoice scope; if its dataset includes fuel or equipment, do not repeat them as owned inventory. No federated multisite average or speculative universal service share. | `farmed-oyster-foreground-method` |
| `boundary_credits` | applicable nodes and complete foreground package | Record actual direct water discharge, biodeposition, lost gear, mortality and bottom-contact evidence with actual substance and receiving medium. No automatic carbon sequestration, shell-carbon, avoided waste, nutrient-removal or ecosystem-service negative credit. Any later impact claim requires separately governed complete method, counterfactual and measured evidence, outside this default inventory. | `farmed-oyster-foreground-method` |

## 6. Process Inventory Structure

### Process Map

| process_id | process_name | inclusion | inclusion_condition | role | quantitative_reference |
| --- | --- | --- | --- | --- | --- |
| `spat_collection` | Owned wild spat collection | conditional | Only actual owned collection of wild spat before managed grow-out; purchased seed bypasses this node | foreground production and actual-state handover | per 1 kg reference flow |
| `algal_culture` | Owned algal feed culture | conditional | Only when feed cultures are produced under foreground responsibility for active hatchery, settlement or nursery consumers | foreground production and actual-state handover | per 1 kg reference flow |
| `hatchery` | Owned broodstock and larval hatchery | conditional | Only owned broodstock, fertilized-egg or larval stages actually performed; purchased eyed larvae bypass absent earlier hatchery stages | foreground production and actual-state handover | per 1 kg reference flow |
| `settlement` | Owned settlement or remote setting | conditional | Only when owned larvae are actually set; purchased settled spat or grow-out seed bypasses this node | foreground production and actual-state handover | per 1 kg reference flow |
| `nursery` | Owned oyster nursery | conditional | Only the actual owned nursery after collected, settled or purchased spat; seed suitable for grow-out goes directly there | foreground production and actual-state handover | per 1 kg reference flow |
| `growout` | Managed oyster grow-out | required | Every covered oyster undergoes an actual owned managed grow-out stage before harvest | foreground production and actual-state handover | per 1 kg reference flow |
| `harvest` | Independent harvest of managed oysters | required | Actual removal of managed live oysters from their declared grow-out context | foreground production and actual-state handover | per 1 kg reference flow |
| `conditioning` | Washing and desanding | conditional | Actual owned pre-gate washing/desanding in its recorded position; absence bypasses unchanged state to the next actual node | foreground production and actual-state handover | per 1 kg reference flow |
| `grading` | Destination and market grading | required | Every final lot receives actual live-state, market-acceptance and destination inspection; mechanical grading only if actually performed | foreground production and actual-state handover | per 1 kg reference flow |
| `depuration` | Actual pre-gate sanitary depuration or relaying | conditional | Only treatment actually under producer responsibility before first handover and supported by actual applicable authorization and release evidence; unknown is not inactive | foreground production and actual-state handover | per 1 kg reference flow |
| `live_holding` | Actual pre-gate live holding and cooling | conditional | Only actual producer-responsible live holding or cooling before first handover; direct dispatch bypasses the node | foreground production and actual-state handover | per 1 kg reference flow |
| `dispatch` | First producer presentation and handover | required | Every qualifying lot is weighed, labelled or documented at its actual first producer handover; packaging only if used | foreground production and actual-state handover | per 1 kg reference flow |

Index nodes by actual cohorts, culture batches, harvest events and dispatch lots; reporting-period aggregation retains opening/closing stock, cross-period growth and returns. Paired internal exchanges denote physical handover, not deletion of producing burdens at aggregation. Inactive conditional cards have no positive exchange; missing records are not zero. Semantic umbrella cards split into actual material/state/destination/property-specific exchanges; non-mass services cannot be forced into mass cards. Every nonfinal card uses the section 8 two-view procedure: retain unallocated physical quantities and normalize by matching accepted final live net kg; assign shared-resource service events once, and separately apply co-product LCA allocation once. Internal seed or harvested feed is never fixed to final 1 kg.

### Process: Owned wild spat collection (`spat_collection`)

This independent capture boundary ends at a weighed/count-and-sampled settled-spat transfer, not at edible adult harvest. Declare waterbody, species, collector deployment, collection effort and losses; collectors/cultch are not oyster body mass.

#### Inputs

###### Actual externally supplied treated industrial process water (`spat_collection_water_supply`)

Only an actually matching supplied treated process-water product; unsuitable to stand for untreated seawater abstraction, tank recirculation or food-grade quality certification.

Conditional identity: only actual externally purchased treated industrial process water matching this UUID may use this binding. Supply specification and site evidence must establish quality/salinity suitability for the precise animal-contact, carrier, washing or ice-making use. Do not assume an industrial-water supply; abstraction, freshwater/seawater, other grades and internal circulation require their own independently verified identities and quantities.

###### Water actually transferred to another owned node (`spat_collection_internal_water_transfer`)

Record only actual cross-node water transfers, paired to the receiver other_water_supply with identical state, mass, event and transfer id.

###### Water actually transferred to another owned node (`algal_culture_internal_water_transfer`)

Record only actual cross-node water transfers, paired to the receiver other_water_supply with identical state, mass, event and transfer id. This is neither environmental release nor independent sale and adds no second abstraction burden. Carrier water already included in algal feed uses the matched material-composition ledger, not a duplicate water exchange here.

###### Water actually transferred to another owned node (`settlement_internal_water_transfer`)

Record only actual cross-node water transfers, paired to the receiver other_water_supply with identical state, mass, event and transfer id. This is neither environmental release nor independent sale and adds no second abstraction burden. Carrier water already included in algal feed uses the matched material-composition ledger, not a duplicate water exchange here.

##### Waste flows

###### Collected dead oysters sent to treatment (`growout_collected_mortality`)

Only actual collected dead oysters leaving grow-out for documented treatment. Retain species, count, native shell/body wet mass, moisture, event and recipient; exclude removed biofouling, sediment, gear and separately removed liquid. Uncollected mortality is not collected waste. Establish this stream’s independent range or measurement-uncertainty evidence. A combined removed-waste total does not supply this amount; unknown separate mass or fate blocks completion, never a default or zero.

- Flow property / unit: Mass `93a60a56-a3c8-11da-a746-0800200b9a66`; unit group `93a60a57-a4c8-11da-a746-0800200c9a66` / kg
- Amount rule: Independently measure collected dead-oyster wet kg under cp_growout_mass, then divide its unallocated physical quantity by matching positive final accepted net oyster kg. Count actual loss and treatment ownership once; do not copy a combined quantity or range.

###### Removed grow-out biofouling sent to treatment (`growout_removed_biofouling`)

Only an actual separately identified removed-biofouling waste stream exported to documented treatment. Record material/organism composition, wet mass, moisture, removal event and recipient; distinct physical streams or treatment routes require independent cards and quantities. Exclude dead oysters, loose sediment, gear and separately removed liquid. No UUID, numerical Range or quantity is inherited from mortality. If combined-removal records cannot establish the separate amounts, retain the evidence gap and block completion rather than inventing a split.

Record only actual cross-node water transfers, paired to the receiver other_water_supply with identical state, mass, event and transfer id. This is neither environmental release nor independent sale and adds no second abstraction burden. Carrier water already included in algal feed uses the matched material-composition ledger, not a duplicate water exchange here.

### Process: Actual pre-gate sanitary depuration or relaying (`depuration`)

Retain live product state. Declare whether controlled-tank depuration or relaying, actual waterbody/tank, duration, disinfection technology, monitoring, transfers and release criteria. This conditional preservation parent does not claim removal of all toxins or confer food-safety certification. If first gate occurs before independent buyer treatment, exclude that downstream treatment and disclose actual acceptance/use limitations. No mandated universal time, chemical dose or legal standard. Relaying is not assumed to be short tank depuration: identify real relocation transport, receiving waterbody, dates and producer responsibility. Continued growth belongs to growout with receiving-site stock, periods and actual biological inputs/losses, while only the evidenced sanitary-conditioning responsibility stays here. An independent buyer/site outside the declared operating unit is not silently included. Historical guidance alone cannot authorize release of contaminated or toxin-bearing oysters.

###### Water actually transferred to another owned node (`dispatch_internal_water_transfer`)

Record only actual cross-node water transfers, paired to the receiver other_water_supply with identical state, mass, event and transfer id. This is neither environmental release nor independent sale and adds no second abstraction burden. Carrier water already included in algal feed uses the matched material-composition ledger, not a duplicate water exchange here.

###### Water actually evaporated to air (`dispatch_water_evaporation`)

The bound identity represents emissions to air, unspecified. Where actual evidence identifies a more specific air subcompartment, verify and select the corresponding identity before finalizing the dataset. Record measured or evidenced materially relevant evaporation mass, period and receiving air compartment, reconciling intake, supply, internal transfers, carriers and stocks. Never invent evaporation as a balancing plug or duplicate water vapour already recorded in another emission card.

## 7. Allocation and Co-product Handling

| rule_id | Applies to | Rule | source_ids |
| --- | --- | --- | --- |
| `allocation_output` | applicable nodes and complete foreground package | Enumerate actual intended final food grades, independent sold seed/broodstock or other live products with their own gate; distinguish internal seed, live undersize returns, stock, waste and environmental losses. Subdivide measured operations first. For unavoidable shared production choose a documented causal physical driver; if no defensible physical relationship exists, use matched-period economic value with actual comparable net prices and sensitivity. Do not simultaneously credit substitution or change methods between nodes to minimize the reference burden. | `farmed-oyster-foreground-method` |
| `allocation_period` | applicable nodes and complete foreground package | Link all cohorts from collection/early-life through harvest, plus opening/closing standing animals and accumulated burden, asset acquisition/replacement/retirement and cleaning events, across their actual periods. Allocate measured asset service by actual lifetime service units/usage, revising estimates with retirement evidence; carry unharvested/returned stock burden forward and reconcile opening plus additions with exported, lost and closing burden. No arbitrary universal lifetime or annual yield. | `farmed-oyster-foreground-method` |
| `allocation_shared` | applicable nodes and complete foreground package | For shared boats, pumps, water treatment, tanks, stores and crates list consuming nodes and periods with event/asset id. Assign measured operating hour, metered volume/energy, area-time or other causal service share once; shares over all consumers reconcile to one total. Keep each node own protocol but not duplicate common raw event. External services and owned operation are mutually exclusive for the same supplied scope. | `farmed-oyster-foreground-method` |
| `allocation_returns` | applicable nodes and complete foreground package | Live grading undersize returns remain cohort stock, paired to growout_returns; retained seed/broodstock similarly carry historic burden without a new sale, purchase or full crop reset. Add actual extra grow-out/rehandling resources and mortality on return, do not divide the same original burden into the loop twice. Dead/rejected material never counts toward final live mass; actual treatment burdens remain in the producing lot unless explicit coproduct subdivision evidence supports otherwise. | `farmed-oyster-foreground-method` |
| `allocation_secondary` | applicable nodes and complete foreground package | Apply the declared secondary-shell inheritance/cut-off at its actual recovery handoff consistently to purchased and own recovered material, disclose prior and current preparation burdens and test double counting. Shell attached to marketed oyster has no separate shell coproduct until actually separated and exported; native shell stays in whole product, so no fictitious shell sale or sequestration credit. | `farmed-oyster-foreground-method` |

### Calculation Rules

| rule_id | Applies to | Formula or rule | Inputs | Output | source_ids |
| --- | --- | --- | --- | --- | --- |
| `foreground_normalization` | all non-final inventory rows | Keep two explicitly labelled views. First reconcile unallocated physical receipts, transfers, products, losses and stocks for the complete declared cohort/trip/run; pair internal transfers in the same state and unit, retaining their measured mass. Assign shared resource/service events to actual consuming nodes and periods once using evidenced service shares, without shrinking product, biomass, water or waste partitions by a co-product share. Divide this physical inventory by the matching positive accepted final net kg. Separately derive a labelled single-output LCA burden/inventory projection using section 7 co-product allocation exactly once, retaining the unallocated inventory and allocation matrix. Never test allocated exchanges against an unallocated physical balance, apply output shares again downstream, or set an internal quantity to the final 1 kg. | node quantities/attribution ledger; cp_dispatch_mass accepted net mass; corresponding node protocol | actual exchanges per 1 kg reference flow | `farmed-oyster-foreground-method` |
| `stage_mass_conversion` | seed and stock counts | Stage net biomass = actual count × representative individual net mass of matching cohort/stage/state; exclude external cultch and propagate sampling error. Only measured stage samples support conversion, not meat yield. | actual counts, representative weighed samples, cultch tare and node protocol | stage net mass and uncertainty | `farmed-oyster-foreground-method` |
| `emission_accounting` | actual node fossil_co2 and other direct emission cards | Compute direct fossil carbon dioxide from actual fuel/carbon/oxidation evidence or declared factor matched to actual technology/fuel/period; separate biogenic carbon and other exact substances. Then apply node attribution and accepted final net-mass normalization; no universal default emission factor. | node fuel, fossil carbon, oxidation or actual factor source, receiving compartment and matching mass protocol | medium-specific direct emitted mass and uncertainty | `farmed-oyster-foreground-method` |
| `cohort_stock_reconciliation` | cohort and return stock | For each cohort reconcile opening live count + actual entries = harvested/exported + mortality/other losses + closing live count; biomass separately includes growth and actual inputs/outputs, without equal mass across growth. Independently reconcile accumulated burden opening + additions = exported attribution + loss attribution + closing carryover; internal loops create no purchase or reference sale. | node cohort counts/mass; opening/closing/return transfers; added and attributed burdens | auditable count, mass and burden carryover | `farmed-oyster-foreground-method` |
| `environmental_nutrition_model` | growout_natural_nutrition | Only with a declared site model and independent calibration evidence, calculate assimilated environmental biological matter as f(actual environmental observations, cohort live biomass, time). Retain actual algebra, parameter units/provenance, raw quantities, independent calibration/validation, species/stage and wet/dry basis and uncertainty, then apply the two-view normalization rule. Adult weight gain or gross filtration alone is not assimilated intake. Missing model or observations is an unresolved quantitative gap, not zero or a complete data package. | actual observations; independently calibrated model; parameters/units; cohort and period | assimilated environmental biological matter mass and uncertainty | `farmed-oyster-foreground-method` |

### Data Quality Requirements

| requirement_id | Applies to | Requirement | Evidence |

| `dq_temporal_shared` | cross-period cohorts and shared assets | complete cycles, opening/closing living stock and accumulated burden, asset service and common meters reconcile over same events/periods; actual mortality/no-output periods retain burdens | asset service/retirement, stock, event shares and reconciliation |
| `dq_empirical_ranges` | all cards and ranges | provisional envelopes never replace amounts; empirical ranges require independent comparable batches with samples/applicability; all density, factor and mass conversions retain evidence/error | independent sampling, calibration, applicability and uncertainty report |
| `dq_inventory_completion` | all inventory-completion requirements | Create a separate card for every actual physical or chemical exchange, with process, direction, flow type, its own measured quantity, native unit, final-reference normalization, applicability, destination, UUID and independent range evidence. Never copy a family total, a grouped screening range or one UUID onto every child. Use not_applicable only for evidenced absence; unknown is not zero.

## 9. Validation Rules

| rule_id | Applies to | Rule | source_ids |
| --- | --- | --- | --- |
| `validate_scope` | applicable nodes and complete foreground package | Verify species, farmed origin, live state and native-shell net mass at the one actual producer gate. Missing actual acceptance or applicable legal evidence blocks a food-use claim; live status alone is insufficient. Final seed, wild adult, dead, shucked, cooked and frozen output are outside scope. | `farmed-oyster-foreground-method` |
| `validate_routes` | applicable nodes and complete foreground package | Reconstruct actual cohort entry stage and ordered node path, including every active optional intervention and bypass. Purchased larvae/spat/seed skip absent earlier stages but retain supplier burdens; no mandatory nursery or depuration from a classification label. Resolve unknown stage/treatment state before final data use. Check every claimed technology delta against actual equipment, input category, stock and monitoring evidence. | `farmed-oyster-foreground-method` |
| `validate_transfers` | applicable nodes and complete foreground package | Pair every internal output/input at the same actual state, measured quantity and uncertainty. Exclude external cultch and free carrier water identically only for oyster biological net-mass interfaces. For wet algal-culture feed and other supplied materials preserve the same actual wet mass, dry matter, concentration and carrier basis at both ends, retaining carrier water in composition subledgers without a duplicate water exchange. Actual losses, flows and stocks explain differences. Match undersize/broodstock loops without accepted-sales attribution; shell-bearing stock is not constant mass during growth. Normalize only to positive accepted final live net mass; no-output/dead-crop periods retain documented burdens, never divide by zero or omit failed production. | `farmed-oyster-foreground-method` |
| `validate_water` | applicable nodes and complete foreground package | Reconcile abstracted/supplied water, recirculation, carried feed/product water, evaporation, treatment exports, direct returns/discharges and tank stock changes by node. Record elemental nutrient/pollutant mass basis separately from bulk water, do not add both full wastewater and identical direct discharge or count each recirculation pass as new input. | `farmed-oyster-foreground-method` |
| `validate_resources` | applicable nodes and complete foreground package | Reconcile each utility meter, fuel stock, invoice and asset/event owner across all node consumers/periods. Purchased service includes no second identical own fuel; own generation includes fuel and direct emissions once and no duplicate grid purchase. Only exact actual CN low-voltage consumption uses that fixed flow; only actual supplied treated water uses its fixed identity. | `farmed-oyster-foreground-method` |
| `validate_ranges` | applicable nodes and complete foreground package | Review supplied Ranges as provisional reasoned screening envelopes, not measured yields, default inventories or universal limits. Cards without numerical Ranges retain their own independent range or measurement-uncertainty collection duty; never copy a removed mixed-stream range to children. Final exchange completion requires independently supported actual quantity and range/uncertainty evidence for each stream. Numerical QA needs independent comparable campaigns/samples and documented actual state, not the tested batch maximum. Preserve genuine outliers; final 1 kg is normalization only. | `farmed-oyster-foreground-method` |
| `validate_identities` | applicable nodes and complete foreground package | Resolve each concrete foreground exchange to its verified exact physical identity, property/unit and destination before downstream dataset publication; semantic umbrellas may generate zero/one/multiple actual exchanges, never one fabricated universal identity. Identity evidence never supplies emission factors, densities, shelf life or sanitation validity. | `farmed-oyster-foreground-method` |
| `validate_credits` | applicable nodes and complete foreground package | Require actual losses/discharges/gear and site impact evidence with uncertainty; do not cancel them against general qualitative ecosystem benefits. No automatic negative shell-carbon, nutrient, waste or habitat credits. Check node-local protocol ownership, bilingual machine fields and current deterministic projection. | `farmed-oyster-foreground-method` |
| `validate_inventory_completion` | all concrete exchanges and section 8 completion obligations | Verify each applicable dq_complete obligation has separately measured and identity-verified exchange cards. Check each quantity, native unit, range evidence, normalization, receiving medium, destination and non-duplication. Any unfulfilled actual child exchange, quantity, identity or destination makes the final dataset incomplete and fails validation; unknown cannot be zero. Static PCR checking does not replace this evidence. |  |
