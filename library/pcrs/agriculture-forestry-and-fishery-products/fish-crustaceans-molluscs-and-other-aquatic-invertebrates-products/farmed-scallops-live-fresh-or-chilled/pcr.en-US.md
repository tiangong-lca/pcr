# Farmed live whole suspended-net Yesso scallops

## 1. Scope and Applicability

This PCR covers Japanese production of Patinopecten yessoensis from purchased wild-collected spat through suspended-net nursery and growout, craft/winch harvest and local live delivery to the first farmer physical recipient. The product is accepted alive, whole and in its native shells before shucking. Chilling is permitted only while the accepted product remains alive. Pearl or lantern nets define the selected culture technology; bottom sowing, dredging, ear-hanging with drilled shells, hatchery-origin spat, adult wild capture and other scallop species are excluded. Dead whole, shucked, frozen and canned references require another scope. FAO supports the route distinction and need for prompt careful handling, not universal operating parameters (`fao-yesso-scallop-2009`).

Actual independent gentle shell cleaning and packaging are conditional operations. Record their occurrence; absence routes the same measured lot directly to the next node. They do not change the final reference identity. No shell removal, flesh separation, kill step or default food-safety guarantee belongs here. Site records establish live acceptance, the recipient and the physical gate.

## 4. Measurement and Unit Rules

| rule_id | Applies to | Required property | Required unit | Rule |
| --- | --- | --- | --- | --- |
| `reference_mass` | reference product | Mass | kg | Weigh accepted live whole scallops on a calibrated scale; retain raw gross, tare, free water/ice and accepted net mass records under cp_live_receipt. Native shells remain product. Every inventory basis is per 1 kg reference flow. |
| `count_mass` | spat and cohort transfers | Mass | kg | Preserve raw counts and contemporaneous species/cohort/size-specific weighed samples; retain the actual sample-derived count-to-mass conversion and uncertainty. No universal animal-count conversion or juvenile-to-final mass equality is permitted. |
| `native_units` | support and emission instances | Actual exchange-specific property | native unit | Retain fuel mass or volume/density records, electricity energy, transport tkm, equipment h or other real service unit, and chemical active-substance basis independently. Verify actual support identities before exchange creation. Convert only with recorded factors and units; never sum unlike units. |
| `substance_basis` | environmental releases | Mass | kg | Identify actual substance, chemical basis and receiving medium. Separate fossil combustion CO2 from biological respiration and shell/body carbon; nutrient mass is not whole-animal wet mass. |

## 5. System Boundary

### Boundary Abstraction

| Field | Value |
| --- | --- |
| declared_starting_condition | Purchased live wild-collected Yesso scallop spat received at the Japanese farm for suspended-net nursery |
| starting_condition_role | Burden-bearing upstream biological input, not burden-free natural biomass |
| product_classification_scope | Farmed scallops; the selected species, origin, net technology, live native-shell state and physical gate constrain applicability |
| recursive_input_rule | Record same-category spat or live transfers as explicit burden-bearing inputs at their actual entry gate; retain upstream coverage and transfer ids rather than recursively inventing another foreground seed-collection node |
| upstream_dataset_requirement | Supplier evidence must cover wild spat collection, collector gear, nursery before purchase, energy, handling and transport up to the declared receipt; expose missing stages and prevent overlap with farm-owned nursery |
| disclosure | Declare site, source, cohort dates, actual net phases, carryover/failed cycles, cleaning and packaging activation, output destinations, live gate, included logistics, shared assets and evidence gaps |

### Boundary Rules

| rule_id | Applies to | Rule | source_ids |
| --- | --- | --- | --- |
| `boundary_route` | culture and harvest | Separate managed net nursery/growout from craft/winch removal: nursery and growout produce an in-net harvest-ready cohort; harvest removes and hands over collected whole live scallops. Shell drilling, bottom lays and adult capture are outside this route. | fao-yesso-scallop-2009 |
| `boundary_handling` | cleaning, sorting, packaging and delivery | Cleaning is actual gentle first shell preparation, sorting assigns declared accepted/secondary/rejected destinations, packaging protects a live lot when present, and preservation/delivery maintains that live state through physical acceptance. Record bypass handoffs when a conditional node is absent; no artificial zero-operation product or duplicated final exchange. | fao-yesso-scallop-2009 |
| `boundary_food_water` | nursery and growout | Natural food and ambient water-column exposure are environmental context, not a purchased feed exchange, pumped-water abstraction or avoided nutrient burden. Include actual sourced management inputs and real environmental releases; require distinct evidence for any ecosystem-effect study outside this inventory. | fao-yesso-scallop-2009 |
| `boundary_ownership` | all nodes | Assign each craft, winch, longline, net, float, shore facility, washing unit, package pool and delivery asset to its real consuming nodes and periods. A supplier-inclusive service and its included fuel, power, direct emissions or capital are alternative representations of the same burden. Each physical event has one accountable owner. | |
| `boundary_self_generation` | on-site electricity | When actual on-site generation is represented by its fuel, equipment and direct emissions, generated electricity is an internal energy transfer: do not add purchased-grid upstream burdens for that same electricity. Assign the generator event and substance/medium emission instances to its actual emitting node and allocate measured duty to consumers once. Cleaning, sorting and packaging release cards instantiate actual direct releases only when present; a service input never substitutes for an unrecorded directly owned emission. | |
| `boundary_periods` | cohorts and infrastructure | Enumerate spat receipt, nursery, growout, harvest, handling and delivery periods. Carry opening/closing stocks and their attributed burdens between periods once; include failed cohorts, maintenance and nonproductive service in the accountable ledger without assigning them twice. No default cycle or asset lifetime applies. | |

## 6. Process Inventory Structure

### Process Map

| process_id | process_name | inclusion | inclusion_condition | role | quantitative_reference |
| --- | --- | --- | --- | --- | --- |
| `net_culture` | Suspended-net nursery and growout | required | | Cohort production from purchased wild spat to harvest-ready in-net stock; batch/cohort mode indexed by net, site and period | Measured harvest-ready whole live stock; normalized per 1 kg reference flow |
| `craft_harvest` | Craft and winch harvest | required | | Independent removal from net culture to collected live lot, distinct from later shell preparation | Measured collected live lot; normalized per 1 kg reference flow |
| `shell_cleaning` | First gentle shell cleaning | conditional | Actual independent washing or gentle shell preparation occurs before sorting | Collected to cleaned whole live state without shucking | Measured cleaned live lot; normalized per 1 kg reference flow |
| `live_sorting` | Live grade and destination sorting | required | | Separate accepted reference-channel grades, other intended grades and rejects; no fabricated numeric grade thresholds | Measured output set; normalized per 1 kg reference flow |
| `live_packaging` | Live product packaging and presentation | conditional | Actual protective package/presentation operation occurs before delivery | Sorted live to protected/presented live lot; logistics owned by live_delivery | Measured protected live lot excluding package mass; normalized per 1 kg reference flow |
| `live_delivery` | Live preservation and local delivery | required | | Bounded chilling/protection and logistics from ready live lot to live recipient acceptance; actual conditions recorded | 1 kg accepted net live whole product |

Each collection scope below expands only into actual exchanges. Its `U_instance` is independently evidenced and approved for that row instance and native unit, never inherited from a mixed-unit parent. A provisional 0..U bound is an unresolved evidence need, not an empirical typical value, default amount, allowed limit or permission to substitute zero. Product transfer counterparts share transfer ids and carry burdens once. Direct-support alternatives, wastes and releases are conditional on actual occurrence.

## 7. Allocation and Co-product Handling

| rule_id | Applies to | Rule | source_ids |
| --- | --- | --- | --- |
| `allocation_subdivide` | all nodes | First assign independently recorded operations and supplies directly to their real cohorts, grades, nodes and destinations. Do not allocate an inclusive service again through fuel, electricity, emissions or capital. Preserve complete intended-output and waste sets before selecting attribution. | |
| `allocation_outputs` | multiple intended outputs | Enumerate actual accepted live grades and any secondary intended destination with mass, state and physical handoff. Directly attributable burdens stay with that output. For the residual inseparable burden of intentional sale grades of the same species and whole-live function, allocate by each grade's accepted net whole-live mass at its own declared handoff. Record why the outputs have equivalent function/state and retain allocation sensitivity. Internal stock returns and waste are excluded from this intended-sale denominator. Actual outputs with different functions or states require a separately reviewed causal attribution method before finalization. Waste treatment stays attributable to the responsible production, without an assumed co-product credit. | |
| `allocation_periods` | cohorts and reporting periods | Link each input, cleaning/changeover, failed batch, maintenance event, transfer and output to its cohort and nursery/growout/harvest/handling period. Carry stock and burdens forward once. Reconcile opening and closing inventory and avoid allocating a carried stock's full historical burden anew in each year. | |
| `allocation_assets` | shared assets/services | List actual consumers and periods for longlines, nets, floats, craft/winch, shore equipment, cold handling and reusable crates. Subdivide measured duty first; allocate residual shared service with evidenced activity/duty records and an explicit denominator. Reconcile allocated shares to the owned total; document replacement, retirement and nonproductive duty without inventing lifetime, occupancy or reuse counts. | |
| `allocation_no_credit` | natural food, shells and losses | Natural feeding, ambient water, native shells, nutrient uptake and biological carbon do not create default avoided burdens or storage credits. Whole live shell mass is already in the product reference. Escapes and uncollected mortality are ledger losses until any separately quantified environmental release is established. | |

### Calculation Rules

| rule_id | Applies to | Formula or rule | Inputs | Output | source_ids |
| --- | --- | --- | --- | --- | --- |
| `normalize_collected` | all inventory rows | Retain actual raw numerator units and evidenced attribution; divide each attributed cohort/lot amount by the same accepted net live receipt mass in kg. Final reference output divides that accepted mass by itself. Do not force internal transfers or biological spat mass to equal final output. | Attributed raw quantity; accepted net live receipt mass; node-specific protocol | Native numerator quantity per 1 kg reference flow | |
| `sample_conversion` | wild_spat_input and cohort transfers | Where counts are original records, retain weighed same-cohort samples and apply their measured mean individual mass to matched counts, with size/date coverage and uncertainty; no universal conversion supplied. | Raw count; sample count; sample net mass; matching cohort/date/size | Traceable whole-live mass estimate and uncertainty | |
| `cohort_reconciliation` | net_culture | Reconcile opening stock, receipts, internal transfers, harvest, returns, intended removals, mortality, escapes and closing stock by cohort/count, with observed growth and sampling uncertainty. Biological growth prevents a simple equality of input and output wet masses. Ledger movements are not automatically environmental exchanges. | Cohort and stock records; sample evidence; event dates | Reconciled cohort history and explicit unexplained gaps | |
| `release_calculation` | actual release instances | Retain actual substance, compartment and chemical basis; apply documented measured flow/concentration or applicable activity/factor model with units and uncertainty; use exclusive direct/provider ownership and avoid whole-waste/constituent duplication. No factor is prescribed by this PCR. | Actual activity/monitoring; documented factor/method; compartment; service coverage | Substance-specific release per 1 kg reference flow | |

### Data Quality Requirements

| requirement_id | Applies to | Requirement | Evidence |
| --- | --- | --- | --- |
| `quality_scope` | product and inputs | Verify species, purchased wild-spat origin, Japanese site, net route and exact live whole first-recipient state; declare each required qualifier. | Supplier records, net plans, live checks and acceptance gate evidence |
| `quality_complete` | cohorts and periods | Retain complete stock, loss, failed-cycle, asset replacement and period records; disclose missing upstream phases, unresolved identities, unmatched quantities and attribution decisions. | Cohort/period ledger and completeness report |
| `quality_ranges` | every amount and instance | Replace provisional unresolved U bounds with independently supported instance-specific values before applying a QA interval; retain status, basis, evidence and uncertainty. Never interpret 0..U as empirical evidence or a default amount. | Reviewed foreground distributions or applicable external evidence per actual row instance |
| `quality_units` | each exchange | Preserve native units and same-reference denominator; resolve actual flow/property/unit supports and convert counts, water volumes, fuels and chemistry only with retained conversion evidence. | Calibration, samples, unit/support and conversion evidence |
| `quality_live` | preservation and acceptance | Demonstrate actual viable handling and live physical acceptance. Declare temperature/exposure/duration and toxin/health monitoring evidence relevant to the actual lot; this PCR supplies no safe threshold or compliance guarantee. | Condition and recipient acceptance records; applicable monitoring documentation |
| `collect_culture_support` | `net_culture`; Inputs; Product flows: Net-culture management and support instances | Add a separate inventory exchange for each actual physical or chemical flow; determine its identity, flow type, composition/state, native property/unit, provider or receiving medium/destination. Preserve actual unallocated quantities, raw records and normalization under the collection duties below. This requirement is not a collection exchange, an assumed zero, or permission to copy aggregate amounts, ranges or UUIDs onto its components. Expand actual net/rope/float replacement, cleaning materials, maintenance, craft fuel/power or supplier services into separate native-unit exchanges with net/cohort/period owners. No artificial feed or ambient-water input is created. Actual medicinal use requires product and active-substance records, never a prophylactic default. Flow property / unit: Actual instance property / native unit; Amount rule: Measured attributable instance quantity under cp_net_culture; select provider-inclusive service or its separately owned material, fuel, power and asset components exclusively.; Value mode: Foreground record (`foreground_record`); Specificity: Site-specific (`site_specific`); Normalization basis: per 1 kg reference flow; Basis kind: Reference flow (`reference_flow`); Evidence kind: Collected record (`collected_record`); Collection protocol: `cp_net_culture` Range-evidence collection duty (not an established interval and never copied onto each concrete exchange): Range: Provisional unresolved support instance evidence need Range role: QA guardrail (`qa_guardrail`) Lower: 0 Upper: U_culture_support_instance Unit: native unit of the individual instance Basis: per 1 kg reference flow; independently approve each instance upper bound; do not aggregate unlike units Basis kind: Reference flow (`reference_flow`) Evidence kind: Reasoned estimate (`reasoned_estimate`) | Raw measured/activity, composition, transfer/destination, supplier scope and independent range evidence; `cp_net_culture`;  |
| `collect_culture_waste` | `net_culture`; Outputs; Waste flows: Collected culture waste instances | Add a separate inventory exchange for each actual physical or chemical flow; determine its identity, flow type, composition/state, native property/unit, provider or receiving medium/destination. Preserve actual unallocated quantities, raw records and normalization under the collection duties below. This requirement is not a collection exchange, an assumed zero, or permission to copy aggregate amounts, ranges or UUIDs onto its components. Record actually recovered mortalities, removed fouling/predators and discarded gear by material and treatment destination. Uncollected deaths or escapes stay in the cohort ledger and require separately characterized release evidence; they are not automatically whole-animal elementary flows. Flow property / unit: Mass `93a60a56-a3c8-11da-a746-0800200b9a66` / kg; Amount rule: Weighed outgoing waste instance under cp_net_culture with destination and treatment ownership.; Value mode: Foreground record (`foreground_record`); Specificity: Site-specific (`site_specific`); Normalization basis: per 1 kg reference flow; Basis kind: Reference flow (`reference_flow`); Evidence kind: Collected record (`collected_record`); Collection protocol: `cp_net_culture` Range-evidence collection duty (not an established interval and never copied onto each concrete exchange): Range: Provisional unresolved waste instance evidence need Range role: QA guardrail (`qa_guardrail`) Lower: 0 Upper: U_culture_waste_instance Unit: kg Basis: per 1 kg reference flow; independently approve each recovered material upper bound Basis kind: Reference flow (`reference_flow`) Evidence kind: Reasoned estimate (`reasoned_estimate`) | Raw measured/activity, composition, transfer/destination, supplier scope and independent range evidence; `cp_net_culture`;  |

This requirement is not a collection exchange, an assumed zero, or permission to copy aggregate amounts, ranges or UUIDs onto its components. Expand supported excretion, biodeposition, respiration, medicine/residue or actual non-CO2 combustion releases by substance, basis and receiving compartment. Exclude fossil CO2 separately recorded in culture_fossil_co2. Natural-food uptake does not establish an avoided burden; shell carbon is not a permanent storage credit. Avoid counting a whole discarded material and its included substances as two releases. Flow property / unit: Mass `93a60a56-a3c8-11da-a746-0800200b9a66` / kg; Amount rule: Measured or explicitly modelled substance-specific release under cp_net_culture; retain evidence, factors, uncertainty and receiving medium.; Value mode: Calculated value (`calculated_value`); Specificity: Site-specific (`site_specific`); Normalization basis: per 1 kg reference flow; Basis kind: Reference flow (`reference_flow`); Evidence kind: Calculated from collection (`calculated_from_collection`); Collection protocol: `cp_net_culture` Range-evidence collection duty (not an established interval and never copied onto each concrete exchange): Range: Provisional unresolved release instance evidence need Range role: QA guardrail (`qa_guardrail`) Lower: 0 Upper: U_culture_release_instance Unit: kg of actual substance on its declared basis Basis: per 1 kg reference flow; independently approve each substance and medium upper bound Basis kind: Reference flow (`reference_flow`) Evidence kind: Reasoned estimate (`reasoned_estimate`) | Raw measured/activity, composition, transfer/destination, supplier scope and independent range evidence; `cp_net_culture`;  |
| `collect_harvest_support` | `craft_harvest`; Inputs; Product flows: Craft and winch support instances | Add a separate inventory exchange for each actual physical or chemical flow; determine its identity, flow type, composition/state, native property/unit, provider or receiving medium/destination. Preserve actual unallocated quantities, raw records and normalization under the collection duties below. This requirement is not a collection exchange, an assumed zero, or permission to copy aggregate amounts, ranges or UUIDs onto its components. Separate actual fuel, power, equipment use, lubricant and complete harvest-service alternatives in native units. Harvest owns the removal trip; culture maintenance trips are not counted again. Flow property / unit: Actual instance property / native unit; Amount rule: Measured attributable harvest support instance under cp_craft_harvest; retain trip and asset-period ownership.; Value mode: Foreground record (`foreground_record`); Specificity: Site-specific (`site_specific`); Normalization basis: per 1 kg reference flow; Basis kind: Reference flow (`reference_flow`); Evidence kind: Collected record (`collected_record`); Collection protocol: `cp_craft_harvest` Range-evidence collection duty (not an established interval and never copied onto each concrete exchange): Range: Provisional unresolved harvest support evidence need Range role: QA guardrail (`qa_guardrail`) Lower: 0 Upper: U_harvest_support_instance Unit: native unit of the individual instance Basis: per 1 kg reference flow; independently approve each instance upper bound Basis kind: Reference flow (`reference_flow`) Evidence kind: Reasoned estimate (`reasoned_estimate`) | Raw measured/activity, composition, transfer/destination, supplier scope and independent range evidence; `cp_craft_harvest`;  |
| `collect_harvest_waste` | `craft_harvest`; Outputs; Waste flows: Recovered incidental or damaged harvest material | Add a separate inventory exchange for each actual physical or chemical flow; determine its identity, flow type, composition/state, native property/unit, provider or receiving medium/destination. Preserve actual unallocated quantities, raw records and normalization under the collection duties below. This requirement is not a collection exchange, an assumed zero, or permission to copy aggregate amounts, ranges or UUIDs onto its components. Collected non-target material, recovered broken/dead scallops and actual discarded gear are separate waste instances with treatment handoffs; uncollected loss remains separately recorded. Flow property / unit: Mass `93a60a56-a3c8-11da-a746-0800200b9a66` / kg; Amount rule: Weigh each actually collected waste destination under cp_craft_harvest.; Value mode: Foreground record (`foreground_record`); Specificity: Site-specific (`site_specific`); Normalization basis: per 1 kg reference flow; Basis kind: Reference flow (`reference_flow`); Evidence kind: Collected record (`collected_record`); Collection protocol: `cp_craft_harvest` Range-evidence collection duty (not an established interval and never copied onto each concrete exchange): Range: Provisional unresolved harvest waste evidence need Range role: QA guardrail (`qa_guardrail`) Lower: 0 Upper: U_harvest_waste_instance Unit: kg Basis: per 1 kg reference flow; independently approve each material upper bound Basis kind: Reference flow (`reference_flow`) Evidence kind: Reasoned estimate (`reasoned_estimate`) | Raw measured/activity, composition, transfer/destination, supplier scope and independent range evidence; `cp_craft_harvest`;  |
| `collect_harvest_other_release` | `craft_harvest`; Outputs; Elementary flows: Other actual direct harvest release | Add a separate inventory exchange for each actual physical or chemical flow; determine its identity, flow type, composition/state, native property/unit, provider or receiving medium/destination. Preserve actual unallocated quantities, raw records and normalization under the collection duties below. This requirement is not a collection exchange, an assumed zero, or permission to copy aggregate amounts, ranges or UUIDs onto its components. Expand actual combustion pollutants or leakage by identified substance and medium; a generic NOx/SOx/particulate label is not an exact flow identity. Exclude fossil CO2 already recorded in harvest_fossil_co2 and releases already included in provider-inclusive harvest services. Flow property / unit: Mass `93a60a56-a3c8-11da-a746-0800200b9a66` / kg; Amount rule: Retain substance-specific measured/modelled release, fuel basis and factors under cp_craft_harvest; exclude CO2 already recorded above.; Value mode: Calculated value (`calculated_value`); Specificity: Site-specific (`site_specific`); Normalization basis: per 1 kg reference flow; Basis kind: Reference flow (`reference_flow`); Evidence kind: Calculated from collection (`calculated_from_collection`); Collection protocol: `cp_craft_harvest` Range-evidence collection duty (not an established interval and never copied onto each concrete exchange): Range: Provisional unresolved other release evidence need Range role: QA guardrail (`qa_guardrail`) Lower: 0 Upper: U_harvest_other_release_instance Unit: kg of actual substance Basis: per 1 kg reference flow; independently approve substance/medium instance upper bound Basis kind: Reference flow (`reference_flow`) Evidence kind: Reasoned estimate (`reasoned_estimate`) | Raw measured/activity, composition, transfer/destination, supplier scope and independent range evidence; `cp_craft_harvest`;  |
| `collect_cleaning_water` | `shell_cleaning`; Inputs; Product flows: Actual sourced cleaning water | Add a separate inventory exchange for each actual physical or chemical flow; determine its identity, flow type, composition/state, native property/unit, provider or receiving medium/destination. Preserve actual unallocated quantities, raw records and normalization under the collection duties below. This requirement is not a collection exchange, an assumed zero, or permission to copy aggregate amounts, ranges or UUIDs onto its components. Purchased water is a product input. Any actual direct seawater abstraction must instead be instantiated as an elementary resource input with its actual medium and support; never record both for the same water. Passive net exposure is excluded. Flow property / unit: Mass `93a60a56-a3c8-11da-a746-0800200b9a66` / kg; Amount rule: Meter actual supplied water under cp_shell_cleaning with source, density/conversion and recirculation records; count only net externally supplied volume/mass.; Value mode: Foreground record (`foreground_record`); Specificity: Site-specific (`site_specific`); Normalization basis: per 1 kg reference flow; Basis kind: Reference flow (`reference_flow`); Evidence kind: Collected record (`collected_record`); Collection protocol: `cp_shell_cleaning` Range-evidence collection duty (not an established interval and never copied onto each concrete exchange): Range: Provisional unresolved water evidence need Range role: QA guardrail (`qa_guardrail`) Lower: 0 Upper: U_cleaning_water Unit: kg Basis: per 1 kg reference flow; independently approve actual supply upper bound Basis kind: Reference flow (`reference_flow`) Evidence kind: Reasoned estimate (`reasoned_estimate`) | Raw measured/activity, composition, transfer/destination, supplier scope and independent range evidence; `cp_shell_cleaning`;  |

This requirement is not a collection exchange, an assumed zero, or permission to copy aggregate amounts, ranges or UUIDs onto its components. Expand actual cleaning aids, power, equipment or inclusive service in native units; identify aid chemistry and residue where used. Do not assume a disinfectant or depuration treatment. Flow property / unit: Actual instance property / native unit; Amount rule: Measure each attributed instance under cp_shell_cleaning with exclusive provider/direct ownership.; Value mode: Foreground record (`foreground_record`); Specificity: Site-specific (`site_specific`); Normalization basis: per 1 kg reference flow; Basis kind: Reference flow (`reference_flow`); Evidence kind: Collected record (`collected_record`); Collection protocol: `cp_shell_cleaning` Range-evidence collection duty (not an established interval and never copied onto each concrete exchange): Range: Provisional unresolved cleaning support evidence need Range role: QA guardrail (`qa_guardrail`) Lower: 0 Upper: U_cleaning_support_instance Unit: native unit of the individual instance Basis: per 1 kg reference flow; independently approve each instance upper bound Basis kind: Reference flow (`reference_flow`) Evidence kind: Reasoned estimate (`reasoned_estimate`) | Raw measured/activity, composition, transfer/destination, supplier scope and independent range evidence; `cp_shell_cleaning`;  |

This requirement is not a collection exchange, an assumed zero, or permission to copy aggregate amounts, ranges or UUIDs onto its components. Separate collected solids, dead/rejected scallops and wastewater sent to treatment into actual destination instances. A wastewater service may include treatment emissions; do not duplicate them as direct discharge. Flow property / unit: Mass `93a60a56-a3c8-11da-a746-0800200b9a66` / kg; Amount rule: Weigh/meter each outgoing treatment-bound material under cp_shell_cleaning and retain destination.; Value mode: Foreground record (`foreground_record`); Specificity: Site-specific (`site_specific`); Normalization basis: per 1 kg reference flow; Basis kind: Reference flow (`reference_flow`); Evidence kind: Collected record (`collected_record`); Collection protocol: `cp_shell_cleaning` Range-evidence collection duty (not an established interval and never copied onto each concrete exchange): Range: Provisional unresolved cleaning waste evidence need Range role: QA guardrail (`qa_guardrail`) Lower: 0 Upper: U_cleaning_waste_instance Unit: kg Basis: per 1 kg reference flow; independently approve each destination instance upper bound Basis kind: Reference flow (`reference_flow`) Evidence kind: Reasoned estimate (`reasoned_estimate`) | Raw measured/activity, composition, transfer/destination, supplier scope and independent range evidence; `cp_shell_cleaning`;  |

Preserve actual unallocated quantities, raw records and normalization under the collection duties below. This requirement is not a collection exchange, an assumed zero, or permission to copy aggregate amounts, ranges or UUIDs onto its components. Instantiate only actual direct releases. Direct outfall requires measured water return and individually identified pollutants on declared substance bases and receiving water. Actual node-owned generator combustion or leakage requires its own substance/air instance, including fossil CO2 if present; exclude provider-inclusive releases. Material sent to treatment is owned by cleaning_waste instead. Do not require a release where none occurs.

Preserve actual unallocated quantities, raw records and normalization under the collection duties below.

## 9. Validation Rules

| rule_id | Applies to | Rule | source_ids |
| --- | --- | --- | --- |
| `validate_identity` | reference and inventory | Match actual flow type, substance/product state, destination, geography, property/unit and gate before concrete UUID binding; all unresolved actual rows and support gaps remain explicit. The final reference link addresses live_scallops_receipt only. | |
| `validate_mass_live` | final reference | Require 1 kg accepted net whole live body-plus-native-shell product with calibrated mass, excluded tare/free water/ice and same-lot live recipient acceptance. Dead, shucked or unknown-state receipt fails this scope. | |
| `validate_handoffs` | all process nodes | Verify exact predecessor and destination transfer ids and quantities; cleaning/packaging activation or bypass must be known. Check accepted grades, secondary intended outputs, returned stock, rejects, waste and losses separately; no two final outputs represent the same physical mass. | |
| `validate_period_mode` | batch/cohort and asset ledgers | Verify cohort/run/phase and reporting-period indices, opening/closing stocks, failed/nonproductive duty, maintenance/changeovers and replacement/retirement. Each carried burden and shared event is owned once. | |
| `validate_attribution` | multiple outputs and shared infrastructure | Check complete intended outputs, consumer-node/period lists, declared attribution decision and evidence. Direct assignment precedes residual allocation; shares reconcile to owned totals and supplier-inclusive/direct components do not overlap. Unknown allocation or lifetime evidence remains a finalization gap. | |
| `validate_environment` | losses and releases | Do not infer kg elementary emissions from whole escaped/dead animals, natural food or ambient exposure. Require actual substance/medium/basis for biological, cleaning and combustion releases, distinguish fossil CO2, and avoid treatment/direct-discharge duplication. No default nutrient, shell-carbon or avoided-product credit. | |
| `validate_ranges` | all actual exchanges | Every actual instance needs its own range basis/status and independently approved upper-bound evidence; no mixed-unit parent bound or unexplained default zero. The 1..1 final interval is normalization only, not survival or yield evidence. | |
| `validate_atomic_completion` | all applicable collection requirements and concrete inventory exchanges | Resolve every applicable section-8 collection requirement into individual physical/chemical exchanges with their own quantities, native units, composition/state, range basis or explicit uncertainty evidence, raw records, normalization, actual destinations/receiving media and verified compatible UUIDs. Any unresolved applicable requirement makes the final dataset incomplete and validation fails; unknown is not zero. Never copy aggregate amounts onto components or duplicate inclusive services with owned fuel/electricity/direct releases. Internal transfers are not fixed to the final 1 kg. | |
