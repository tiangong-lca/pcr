# Wild live whole hookah-dived red sea urchins

## 1. Scope and Applicability

This PCR covers wild California red sea urchins (Mesocentrotus franciscanus) collected by hookah divers using hands or handheld rakes and delivered whole and live at the first physical recipient acceptance from the harvester. The declared LCA gate precedes opening or gonad extraction and is established by actual custody and acceptance records, independently of invoice date or legal title. West Coast Sea Grant identifies this species and live/fresh products; its dive description supports surface-supplied breathing air, mesh-bag lifting and alternative live-holding arrangements (`wcsg-red-urchin`; `wcsg-dive`). California, hookah and whole-live acceptance are this PCR's selected subset, not claims about all fisheries.

Exclude other urchin species, scuba or free-diving routes, hatchery production, ranching/fattening, deliberately cultivated stock, culling-only killing, dead/frozen reference products and extracted uni. An intended secondary output may exist on a shared trip but cannot become this reference product. No automatic biodiversity, kelp-restoration, carbon-removal or avoided-treatment credit accompanies capture. This PCR does not establish food-safety or legal compliance.

## 4. Measurement and Unit Rules

| rule_id | Applies to | Required property | Required unit | Rule |
| --- | --- | --- | --- | --- |
| `reference_mass` | reference product | Mass `93a60a56-a3c8-11da-a746-0800200b9a66` | kg | Use calibrated acceptance weighing under cp_accept. Exclude bags, bins, coverings, foreign loose material and free seawater; retain native test/spines, internal water and gonads. Record drainage/tare method without changing whole-live state. Spine damage alone does not define a reject. |
| `conversion_evidence` | material, energy and service records | Recorded property | Original unit and documented equivalent | Counts, volume fuel/water and package counts require lot-specific mass/density evidence where converted. Keep electricity and fuel energy bases distinct; retain measured MJ or documented kWh conversion. Services retain h or tkm, never a fabricated kg conversion. Gonad yield is not whole-live yield. |

## 5. System Boundary

### Boundary Abstraction

| Field | Value |
| --- | --- |
| declared_starting_condition | Wild red sea urchins in California marine habitat, with natural-stock provenance and trip access/support disclosed |
| starting_condition_role | Natural biological capture context, not a burden-free purchased product or managed grow-out process |
| product_classification_scope | Selected whole-live hookah subset of cpc:3.0:04521 |
| recursive_input_rule | Record any purchased or transferred same-category live lot separately with supplier identity, measured mass and an upstream dataset ending at its actual transfer gate; never relabel it as this trip's capture. Mixed or unknown origin blocks this selected-route dataset until separated or reviewed. |
| upstream_dataset_requirement | Supplier datasets for fuel, electricity, materials, services and capital with compatible geography, period, unit and inclusion boundary; disclose cut-offs and missing upstream coverage |
| disclosure | Site/stock provenance; vessel/compressor/lifting gear; trip calendar; routes and shore support; node activation and transfer log; live-holding mode; support coverage; shared assets and periods; capture/acceptance balances and all destinations |

### Boundary Rules

| rule_id | Applies to | Rule | source_ids |
| --- | --- | --- | --- |
| `boundary_trip` | capture and support | Include preparation/access, travel/search, diving, compressor and lifting operation, return journeys, failed trips, landing and necessary shore support before the acceptance gate. Capture is removal from wild habitat; it is independent of biological production and of later conditioning. | `wcsg-dive` |
| `boundary_nodes` | sorting, preparation, preservation and presentation | These are responsibilities, not a mandated serial plant. Record actual instance timing, entry/exit state and transfer ids. Sorting receives whole collected animals and distinguishes reference-eligible, secondary intended, returned and rejected states. Preparation applies only bounded animal cleaning/preparation; equipment-only cleaning leaves animals on a bypass. Live support may start immediately and overlap sorting, presentation or delivery. | |
| `boundary_live` | preservation | Record actual oxygenated-seawater tank OR wet-covered-bin holding instances and any proven sequence. Air compression/oxygenation is not purchased pure oxygen. No compulsory tank-plus-bin chain, fixed duration or safe temperature is prescribed. Record actual control limits and monitoring evidence. | `wcsg-dive` |
| `boundary_gate` | acceptance | Include actual harvester delivery/landing support to first physical recipient acceptance and only its attributable burden. Opening, gonad extraction, processor activities and later distribution are outside. Rejected loads remain in the trip/period ledger with their actual return or disposal destination. | |
| `boundary_support` | shared assets/services | Maintain one owner for each vessel, compressor, davit, bag, tank, bin, shore asset and shared energy/emission event; enumerate consuming nodes and periods. Inclusive purchased services replace their covered direct resources/emissions/capital rather than supplementing them. No arbitrary equipment lifetime or duplicate asset burden. | |

## 6. Process Inventory Structure

### Process Map

| process_id | process_name | inclusion | inclusion_condition | role | quantitative_reference |
| --- | --- | --- | --- | --- | --- |
| `support` | Actual vessel and equipment support | required | Actual vessel/compressor/lift support and evidenced additional support instances | Physical resource/emission owner with site, equipment and service-period ids | Measured h supplied to named consuming instances |
| `hookah_capture` | Hookah collection and lift | required | All selected trips, including unsuccessful ones | Wild removal and collected-animal handoff | Measured whole collected animals and complete trip ledger |
| `sort` | Grade and destination sorting | required | All harvested lots | Eligibility and destination classification | Actual grade/destination outputs |
| `prepare` | Bounded primary preparation | conditional | Actual animal cleaning/preparation or linked equipment cleaning is performed | Preparation with animal bypass for equipment-only cleaning | Prepared animals and actual residues |
| `live_support` | Actual live preservation instances | conditional | A tank, wet-covered bin or other evidenced pre-gate live-support intervention occurs | Preserve whole-live state | Live output, mortality and effluent by instance |
| `present` | Protective presentation | conditional | Bags, bins, coverings, labels or other pre-gate presentation are used | Product/package interface, excluding delivery | Protected live animals, packaging reuse/rejects |
| `accept` | Landing/delivery and recipient acceptance | required | All reference lots and rejected deliveries | First physical recipient gate | 1 kg accepted net whole-live reference |

Production is trip/batch based within a declared full reporting period. Protocols link every input, output, cleaning/changeover, unsuccessful trip, asset event and acceptance to these boundaries. Transfer ids pair actual animal outputs/inputs between responsible instances, permitting branches and overlapping live support without imposing the table order. Internal transfer amounts remain measured and may exceed final accepted mass. For all cards, normalize attributable activity to per 1 kg reference flow only after complete physical reconciliation and burden attribution.

Each non-reference Range below is an unresolved quantitative-evidence requirement: 0..U_row is neither a measured interval, a maximum drawn from the batch being tested, nor a numerical default. Approve U_row independently using comparable evidence before quantitative use; an inactive conditional row can be zero only with activation evidence. Expand collection obligations in Section 8 into concrete recorded exchanges, each with its own unit, identity and independently approved U_instance. Parent U is neither an aggregate cap nor inherited by instances.

Each support instance is a real vessel or equipment/plant activity at a named site and service period, not an accounting pool. Name its physical operator, equipment and consuming instances. Pair its measured service-hour output with each consuming input before allocating burdens. Only truly shared equipment/resources belong to that instance; unrelated shore or delivery plants require separately identified physical instances with their own evidence and ownership. Support hours are activity transfers, never final animal production. Capture/removal and direct habitat-return ledgers are mandatory ecological/physical records; they are not automatically elementary biomass resources or emissions. Any method electing such exchanges must establish substance/material identity, compatible type/direction/medium and independently verified flow/support identity first.

## 7. Allocation and Co-product Handling

| rule_id | Applies to | Rule | source_ids |
| --- | --- | --- | --- |
| `allocation_reconcile` | complete trip/period | Reconcile natural removal, collected animals, returns, transfers, stock changes, mortality, waste and every actual intended species/grade output before assigning burdens. Live and dead states, reject reasons and destinations remain explicit. Test/spines/gonads retained in whole animals are not separate co-products. | |
| `allocation_outputs` | multiple intended outputs | First subdivide independently measured operations and assign output-specific burdens directly. For remaining shared burdens, use documented causal activity drivers when defensible. Otherwise require a study-specific justified allocation choice and sensitivity, with measured output quantities and any contemporaneous prices retained; no universal economic or mass allocation factor is prescribed. Do not finalize while the choice or output set is unresolved. | |
| `allocation_periods` | trips/assets/periods | Include unsuccessful trips in the full representative period rather than discarding zero-yield effort. Link assets, maintenance, replacement and retirement to actual service periods/consumers; document supported service-life and utilization assumptions and sensitivity. Shares across outputs, nodes and periods exhaust each attributable burden exactly once; do not assign acquisition in full and depreciate it again. | |
| `allocation_service` | direct versus purchased support | Maintain a coverage matrix for each provider, vessel/compressor/davit/tank/bin/shore asset and service period. Replace the covered direct fuel, energy, emissions and capital with inclusive service burdens. Inventory internal transfers and resource stock movements for physical reconciliation without treating them as additional final outputs or new production. | |

Preserve actual unallocated quantities, raw records and normalization under the collection duties below. This requirement is not a collection exchange, an assumed zero, or permission to copy aggregate amounts, ranges or UUIDs onto its components. Expand measured operating hours by real vessel/compressor/lift or other supported plant instance and consuming node. Reconcile service output with paired consumer inputs, including non-reference consumers and periods; do not manufacture a physical exchange solely from allocated burden shares. Flow property / unit: Service duration / h; Amount rule: Measured service hours reconciled through cp_support, per 1 kg reference flow; Value mode: Calculated value (`calculated_value`); Specificity: Technology-specific (`technology_specific`); Normalization basis: per 1 kg reference flow; Basis kind: Reference flow (`reference_flow`); Evidence kind: Calculated from collection (`calculated_from_collection`); Collection protocol: `cp_support` Range-evidence collection duty (not an established interval and never copied onto each concrete exchange): Range: Unresolved native-service output evidence requirement Range role: QA guardrail (`qa_guardrail`) Lower: 0 Upper: U_support_out Unit: h Basis: per 1 kg reference flow; independently approve each U_instance Basis kind: Reference flow (`reference_flow`) Evidence kind: Reasoned estimate (`reasoned_estimate`) | Raw measured/activity, composition, transfer/destination, supplier scope and independent range evidence; `cp_support`;  |

Preserve actual unallocated quantities, raw records and normalization under the collection duties below. This requirement is not a collection exchange, an assumed zero, or permission to copy aggregate amounts, ranges or UUIDs onto its components. Expand actual spent gear, maintenance residues and dead material sent to waste management by composition and destination. Lost gear entering the environment belongs in the actual release ledger rather than an invented managed-waste destination. Flow property / unit: Mass / kg; Amount rule: Recorded managed waste from cp_support, per 1 kg reference flow; Value mode: Calculated value (`calculated_value`); Specificity: Site-specific (`site_specific`); Normalization basis: per 1 kg reference flow; Basis kind: Reference flow (`reference_flow`); Evidence kind: Calculated from collection (`calculated_from_collection`); Collection protocol: `cp_support` Range-evidence collection duty (not an established interval and never copied onto each concrete exchange): Range: Unresolved waste-specific evidence requirement Range role: QA guardrail (`qa_guardrail`) Lower: 0 Upper: U_capture_waste Unit: kg Basis: per 1 kg reference flow; independently approve each U_instance Basis kind: Reference flow (`reference_flow`) Evidence kind: Reasoned estimate (`reasoned_estimate`) | Raw measured/activity, composition, transfer/destination, supplier scope and independent range evidence; `cp_support`;  |

Preserve actual unallocated quantities, raw records and normalization under the collection duties below. This requirement is not a collection exchange, an assumed zero, or permission to copy aggregate amounts, ranges or UUIDs onto its components. Expand actual lost gear, spills and other supported environmental releases with composition, receiving medium and destination. Animal removals and habitat returns remain physical/ecological observations; they become elementary exchanges only under an explicit compatible method and verified exact identity. Keep habitat-disturbance observations as separate non-exchange evidence; no generic beneficial-return credit. Flow property / unit: Mass / kg; Amount rule: Measured or documented actual release from cp_support, per 1 kg reference flow; Value mode: Calculated value (`calculated_value`); Specificity: Site-specific (`site_specific`); Normalization basis: per 1 kg reference flow; Basis kind: Reference flow (`reference_flow`); Evidence kind: Calculated from collection (`calculated_from_collection`); Collection protocol: `cp_support` Range-evidence collection duty (not an established interval and never copied onto each concrete exchange): Range: Unresolved release-specific evidence requirement Range role: QA guardrail (`qa_guardrail`) Lower: 0 Upper: U_capture_releases Unit: kg Basis: per 1 kg reference flow; independently approve each U_instance Basis kind: Reference flow (`reference_flow`) Evidence kind: Reasoned estimate (`reasoned_estimate`) | Raw measured/activity, composition, transfer/destination, supplier scope and independent range evidence; `cp_support`;  |

Preserve actual unallocated quantities, raw records and normalization under the collection duties below. This requirement is not a collection exchange, an assumed zero, or permission to copy aggregate amounts, ranges or UUIDs onto its components. Expand measured or factor-supported pollutants by substance/species, particle fraction, mass basis and receiving air compartment. Broad NOx/SOx/PM names alone do not establish an identity. Include only direct combustion physically owned by the identified support instance. Unrelated plant emissions require their own real instance owner and protocol. Flow property / unit: Mass / kg; Amount rule: Actual fuel/engine records and matching pollutant factors under cp_support, per 1 kg reference flow; Value mode: Calculated value (`calculated_value`); Specificity: Technology-specific (`technology_specific`); Normalization basis: per 1 kg reference flow; Basis kind: Reference flow (`reference_flow`); Evidence kind: Calculated from collection (`calculated_from_collection`); Collection protocol: `cp_support` Range-evidence collection duty (not an established interval and never copied onto each concrete exchange): Range: Unresolved pollutant-specific evidence requirement Range role: QA guardrail (`qa_guardrail`) Lower: 0 Upper: U_other_combustion Unit: kg Basis: per 1 kg reference flow; independently approve each U_instance Basis kind: Reference flow (`reference_flow`) Evidence kind: Reasoned estimate (`reasoned_estimate`) | Raw measured/activity, composition, transfer/destination, supplier scope and independent range evidence; `cp_support`;  |

Preserve actual unallocated quantities, raw records and normalization under the collection duties below. This requirement is not a collection exchange, an assumed zero, or permission to copy aggregate amounts, ranges or UUIDs onto its components.

Preserve actual unallocated quantities, raw records and normalization under the collection duties below. This requirement is not a collection exchange, an assumed zero, or permission to copy aggregate amounts, ranges or UUIDs onto its components. Expand actual secondary intended grades/species and recipient gates of shared trips/periods. A downgraded or dead animal is a product only with documented intended use, destination and status; neither mortality nor bycatch automatically becomes a co-product.

Preserve actual unallocated quantities, raw records and normalization under the collection duties below. This requirement is not a collection exchange, an assumed zero, or permission to copy aggregate amounts, ranges or UUIDs onto its components. Record non-product rejects sent to waste management with reason, live/dead state and receiving treatment. Actual returns to sea instead remain separate ecological/physical return records in the same cp_sort ledger; they are not automatic elementary exchanges. Never count both destinations for one animal. Flow property / unit: Mass / kg; Amount rule: Measured managed sorting rejects from cp_sort, per 1 kg reference flow; Value mode: Calculated value (`calculated_value`); Specificity: Site-specific (`site_specific`); Normalization basis: per 1 kg reference flow; Basis kind: Reference flow (`reference_flow`); Evidence kind: Calculated from collection (`calculated_from_collection`); Collection protocol: `cp_sort` Range-evidence collection duty (not an established interval and never copied onto each concrete exchange): Range: Unresolved reject evidence requirement Range role: QA guardrail (`qa_guardrail`) Lower: 0 Upper: U_sort_waste Unit: kg Basis: per 1 kg reference flow; independently approve each U_instance Basis kind: Reference flow (`reference_flow`) Evidence kind: Reasoned estimate (`reasoned_estimate`) | Raw measured/activity, composition, transfer/destination, supplier scope and independent range evidence; `cp_sort`;  |

Preserve actual unallocated quantities, raw records and normalization under the collection duties below. This requirement is not a collection exchange, an assumed zero, or permission to copy aggregate amounts, ranges or UUIDs onto its components. Pair actual preparation equipment/plant service with support_out and the preparation instance. Equipment-only cleaning does not invent an animal pass.

This requirement is not a collection exchange, an assumed zero, or permission to copy aggregate amounts, ranges or UUIDs onto its components. Expand actual supplied or transferred reusable water/seawater, cleaning agents and consumables by composition and role; do not infer animal chemical treatment from equipment sanitation.

Preserve actual unallocated quantities, raw records and normalization under the collection duties below. This requirement is not a collection exchange, an assumed zero, or permission to copy aggregate amounts, ranges or UUIDs onto its components. Only actual water handed to another technosphere node for reuse is a product transfer. Pair with that receiver's supplied-water input by transfer id, mass, composition and quality; no new abstraction or purchased-water burden is created by this internal reuse.

Record actual fuel/service burdens and attribution for loaded, empty-return and zero-output periods. Inclusive transport-service scope excludes duplicate owned fuel, electricity, assets and direct releases; retain return and reusable-container responsibility. | Actual cargo, distance, trip, container and provider-scope records |

## 9. Validation Rules

| rule_id | Applies to | Rule | source_ids |
| --- | --- | --- | --- |
| `validate_reference` | accepted_live_urchins | Require positive eligible accepted net mass, live whole state, species/provenance/hookah qualifiers and first physical recipient evidence. Confirm one final reference output; the 1..1 range is normalization identity rather than empirical yield. | |
| `validate_transfers` | process graph | Check actual activation/bypass/timing and entry/exit state for every instance; pair measured internal transfers without imposing a tank/bin or other serial order. Every protocol owns its real node; shared events have one burden owner. | |
| `validate_balance` | full trips/periods | Close removal/collection/acceptance, water/material stock and intended-output ledgers before allocation. Do not omit failed trips, dead/reject/return destinations, incidental material, lost gear or attributable shore support. Environmental returns/releases are not managed waste or automatic credits. | |
| `validate_attribution` | all intended outputs, assets and periods | Require explicit reviewed subdivision/driver/allocation decision when multiple intended outputs remain; close service coverage and asset-period shares exactly once. Unresolved replacement/retirement, coverage or allocation choices block dataset finalization. | |
| `validate_identity_ranges` | concrete exchanges | Verify actual type/direction/gate/substance/medium/property/unit identity and approve independent instance-specific quantitative ranges. Semantic cards, unresolved U and a structural checker pass do not establish final data, active use or publication readiness. | |
| `validate_atomic_completion` | all applicable collection requirements and concrete inventory exchanges | Resolve every applicable section-8 collection requirement into individual physical/chemical exchanges with their own quantities, native units, composition/state, range basis or explicit uncertainty evidence, raw records, normalization, actual destinations/receiving media and verified compatible UUIDs. Any unresolved applicable requirement makes the final dataset incomplete and validation fails; unknown is not zero. Never copy aggregate amounts onto components or duplicate inclusive services with owned fuel/electricity/direct releases. Internal transfers are not fixed to the final 1 kg. | |
