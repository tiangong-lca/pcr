# Wild whole live gooseneck barnacles from boat-supported hand scraping

## 1. Scope and Applicability

This PCR produces a foreground data package for wild Pollicipes pollicipes collected by boat-supported manual arrilhada scraping on natural rocky intertidal habitat in the Berlengas, Portugal, and delivered whole and alive to the first physical recipient of the harvester's product in Peniche. It covers actual sorting, live holding and protective presentation before that receipt. Eligibility requires lot-level species, origin, capture technique, condition and recipient evidence. Historical observations support the route; they do not establish that a particular present operation uses it. A live trader offering supports the channel only. Neither this PCR nor an inventory pass establishes legal compliance, food safety or current stock sustainability.

Exclude cultivated animals, diving/SCUBA collection, other barnacle species, edible peduncle separated from plates, cooked or frozen barnacles and operations after the declared first recipient. A first recipient may be an intermediary or consumer taking physical custody; an invoice office, checkpoint or remote buyer is not a physical gate by itself. Do not add routine washing, immersion, depuration, refrigeration or packaging technology without actual records. Cleaning or disaggregation that occurs belongs to the node doing it.

## 4. Measurement and Unit Rules

| rule_id | Applies to | Required property | Required unit | Rule |
| --- | --- | --- | --- | --- |
| `reference_mass` | reference product | Mass `93a60a56-a3c8-11da-a746-0800200b9a66` | kg | Use calibrated weighing at physical acceptance. Include the whole live animal and its native plates. Deduct free water, containers, rocks, sand, non-target fouling and rejected animals; retain deduction records in cp_delivery. |
| `checkpoint_distinction` | `captured_barnacles`, `accepted_live_barnacles` | Mass `93a60a56-a3c8-11da-a746-0800200b9a66` | kg | Keep checkpoint gross harvest and selected accepted net mass as separate observations. Neither a reported catch nor checkpoint registration substitutes for accepted product weighing. |
| `native_measurement` | all inventory rows | Actual instance property | actual native unit | Retain original kg, L, kWh, hours, item counts, service units and treatment measurements. Any conversion uses the same actual composition, density, item mass or service definition with provenance and uncertainty; no edible-yield conversion applies to whole animals. |
| `reference_denominator` | all inventory rows | Actual instance property | actual native unit per kg reference | Record attributable actual quantities divided by the accepted net reference mass for the same declared scope. A zero-acceptance trip retains burdens for period attribution; no division by zero and no substitution of gross catch. |

## 5. System Boundary

### Boundary Abstraction

| Field | Value |
| --- | --- |
| declared_starting_condition | Wild animals attached to natural Berlengas intertidal substrate; no hatchery, feeding or managed growout; boat, harvester and equipment provision identified before the trip |
| starting_condition_role | Natural capture context and collection observation, not a purchased zero-burden product; actual resource removals and ecological observations are disclosed |
| product_classification_scope | The eligible whole live Pollicipes pollicipes subset of other wild crustaceans |
| recursive_input_rule | Internal barnacle transfers carry measured lot mass and transfer ids; purchased barnacles from another harvester are not relabelled as own capture and require a separately bounded upstream dataset or exclusion from this route |
| upstream_dataset_requirement | Fuel, electricity, tools, boat/vehicle assets, packaging and purchased services include their attributable upstream production and supply. Complete purchased services declare included assets, energy, emissions and treatment to prevent repetition. |
| disclosure | Record trips including failed trips, harvest areas, sorting/holding sites, Peniche receipt, own versus purchased duties, reporting/asset periods, initial/final stocks, ecological fates and missing data |

| rule_id | applies_to | rule | source_ids |
| --- | --- | --- | --- |
| `boundary_capture` | `capture` | Include boat mobilization, transit, access, scraping and return to landed handoff within capture duty. Capture separates attached wild resource from landed material; sorting and preservation do not stand in for removal. | `jacinto-berlengas-2010`, `dgrm-arrilhada` |
| `boundary_gate` | all processes | Follow each lot to actual first recipient acceptance in Peniche. Checkpoint unloading/registration records gross harvest and origin; use actual custody and weighing evidence to locate final receipt. | `portaria-berlengas-2025` |
| `boundary_conditions` | `sorting`, `live_holding`, `presentation` | Sorting creates declared accepted, alternate intended and rejected states. Activate holding only for observed bounded live-state interventions; otherwise transfer directly from sorting to presentation. Present using actual containers. Record water/materials/cleaning when used; no universal wash, depuration or temperature prescription. | |
| `boundary_fates` | all processes | Trace rock, sand, attached juveniles, non-target organisms, mortalities, spent containers, fluids and rejects to actual retention, sale, return, disposal or treatment. Habitat disturbance and unmeasured ecology remain disclosed observations/data gaps; do not invent elementary exchanges, waste labels, factors or credits. | |
| `boundary_services` | all processes | Inventory either complete purchased duty or its own operation components at each actual instance. Identify shared boat, scraper, crates, holding space, energy equipment and vehicle consumers by node and period, with one burden owner. | |

## 6. Process Inventory Structure

### Process Map

| process_id | process_name | inclusion | inclusion_condition | role | quantitative_reference |
| --- | --- | --- | --- | --- | --- |
| `capture` | Boat-supported intertidal hand scraping and landing | required | Eligible natural rocky-intertidal trip | Wild removal and landed handoff to sorting; includes return vessel duty | Actual landed target animals per trip and period |
| `sorting` | Grade and destination sorting | required | Each landed lot | Split target grades, other intended destinations and genuine rejects | Actual mass of each lot destination |
| `live_holding` | Bounded live holding | conditional | Actual observed bounded intervention maintains the live state between sorting and presentation | Preserve live state using declared actual practice; bypass when no intervention occurs | Actual live lot handoff and duration |
| `presentation` | Container presentation | required | Actual presentation, including reusable or recipient-supplied container state | Protect/present product; logistics belongs to delivery | Presented live lot net mass and container ownership |
| `delivery` | Delivery and first physical receipt | required | Actual transfer to first recipient in Peniche | Pre-gate logistics, receipt and final net weighing | 1 kg accepted whole live reference flow |

The mode is trip/lot batches within a declared reporting period, not continuous production. Assign shared sailing, access, cleaning, changeover, interrupted trips, empty returns and holding events once to actual duties and period. An immediate transfer without observed live-state intervention bypasses live_holding: sorted_live_barnacles passes directly to presentation_barnacles with T_sort_present. If intervention occurs, use T_sort_hold then T_hold_present and the holding cards; do not also record the bypass receipt for the same material. Unknown actual intervention state is a data gap, not an inactive default. Recipient-owned presentation is recorded explicitly; it does not justify invented inputs. Each collection obligation requires independently identified actual exchanges, native units and instance ids before final dataset construction. A complete-service choice excludes its included operation components. Output fates determine product, waste or elementary classification before concrete exchange construction.

All non-reference ranges below are provisional unresolved evidence envelopes, not empirical defaults, allowed limits or numerical validation gates. Each U is a quantity in the stated instance's native unit per reference flow, independently established from comparable external/previous independent evidence, never the unit itself, a shared cap across different substances/services, or the maximum of the lot being checked. Actual zero requires a recorded absence. If U is unquantified, retain that gap and use collected quantities; no numerical range pass follows.

###### Landed target animals for sorting (`captured_barnacles`)

Target whole animals removed by hand scraping and passed to sorting with transfer id T_capture_sort. Record gross landed/checkpoint observations separately; this card's target-animal quantity excludes incidental mineral material and non-target organisms. Track accompanying material separately with the same transfer id: independently weighed rock, sand, free water and non-target/attached-organism quantities, identity, destination and uncertainty. These physical accompanying quantities are observations, not automatic product, waste or elementary classifications. Both ends of T_capture_sort reconcile the same actual material inventory.

### Process: Grade and destination sorting (`sorting`)

#### Inputs

The input observation ledger below accompanies T_capture_sort and does not assign exchange type by default. Compare it with capture's outgoing ledger before interpreting sorting residues or destination quantities. If an actual material exchange is constructed, classify it from the real source and fate and verify its concrete identity rather than silently inserting it into the target-animal card.

| Incoming observation | Quantity and pairing | Destination reconciliation |
| --- | --- | --- |
| Rock and sand carried with landed animals | Actual independently measured quantities and uncertainty in cp_capture and cp_sorting, same T_capture_sort | Actual removal, retention or return, not target animal mass |
| Attached juveniles and non-target organisms | Actual species/state quantities or explicitly unresolved observation in cp_capture and cp_sorting, same T_capture_sort | Actual retained intended output, documented return, mortality or waste receiver |
| Free/carrier water and tare | Actual separately measured quantities at both handoffs with drainage/tare method | Deduct from animal mass; record real subsequent handling without automatic wastewater/pollutant exchange |

## 7. Allocation and Co-product Handling

| rule_id | applies_to | rule | source_ids |
| --- | --- | --- | --- |
| `allocation_output_set` | all intended outputs | Enumerate target grades, intended downgraded products and actual non-target intended products with species, net mass, state, grade, destination and physical handoff. Distinguish these from losses, residues, organisms returned and genuine waste. Do not make a sale output into burden-free waste because its price is low. | |
| `allocation_precedence` | shared trip and sorting burdens | First subdivide independently metered duties and assign output-specific handling directly. For remaining common capture/sorting duty use documented physical causality such as attributable duty time/load if defensible. When such causality cannot distinguish intended output grades, allocate by same-period first-handoff economic values; disclose quantities/prices, rationale and physical-mass sensitivity. No automatic avoided-production credit is allowed. | |
| `allocation_period` | trips and periods | Include successful, aborted and zero-catch trips and losses in the reporting period; assign directly linked failure to its actual lot/duty, and unresolved common failed duty to the declared period's intended outputs with a documented rationale. Reconcile beginning/ending live stock, pending lots, replacement and termination events; do not drop a low-yield interval or allocate the same burden again next period. | |
| `allocation_shared_assets` | shared boats, crates, tools, spaces and vehicles | Maintain asset/service ids, provision and maintenance totals, useful service and actual consumers across nodes/periods. Attribute once using observed service demand (hours, occupied capacity-time or documented turns, appropriate to the asset), with replacement/retirement and uncertainty. Use no universal lifespan or container reuse count; report sensitivity to uncertain service life and output attribution. | |
| `allocation_service_ownership` | complete purchased services and internal transfers | A purchased complete service owns its included energy/assets/releases/treatment; own operation owns uncovered components only. Internal transfers carry mass and burden once, never a second sale or a fixed 1 kg feed. Package reuse/return transport has one owner and service period. | |

| `validation_eligibility` | reference flow | Require actual eligibility, whole live net mass and physical receipt qualifiers. Reject wrong species/route, cooked/frozen/de-shelled output or unsupported gate substitution. | |
| `validation_transfers` | all internal transfers | Pair T_capture_sort and T_present_deliver by actual lot mass and time. With evidenced holding intervention pair T_sort_hold and T_hold_present; otherwise pair the direct T_sort_present bypass, never both paths for the same material. Unknown intervention state remains incomplete. Investigate discrepancies, stock/mass changes and deductions; do not force internal feed to 1 kg. | |
| `validation_outputs` | output set and fates | Every intended grade/product has an explicit handoff and attribution; every true waste/treatment/direct release has actual destination or receiving medium. Disclose organisms returned, substrate disturbance and unresolved ecology without invented credits/exchanges. | |
| `validation_periods` | capture, holding and shared assets | Include failed duties, changes/cleaning, open stocks and asset replacement/termination in declared periods; require one owner for each trip/service/asset burden across nodes and periods. | |
| `validation_services` | complete provider duties | Reconcile provider coverage against own fuel/assets/releases/treatment and package return duty so no component or intended output is counted twice. | |
| `validation_uncertainty` | quantities and identities | Unquantified U, absent factors, unknown carbon split or unverified concrete UUID remains a data gap. A range/checker pass does not establish actual data completeness, legal compliance, safety or sustainability. | |
| `validate_atomic_completion` | all applicable per-flow collection obligations and final exchanges | Final dataset completion and validation require every actual exchange to have an independent atomic card and its own quantity, property/native unit, collection or calculation evidence, range/uncertainty evidence, normalization, actual destination and verified UUID. Unknown identity, activity state, quantity, range evidence or fate blocks completion; it is never zero, a presumed bypass or permission to omit an obligation. Every important concrete flow retains its own range/uncertainty evidence collection duty; a symbolic upper bound is not an empirical range. | |

## 10. Published Dataset Profile

| Field | Value |
| --- | --- |
| dataset_role | Foreground dataset; after evidence review may support secondary_dataset and background_dataset use |
| downstream_use | process or lifecyclemodel projection for the same whole live reference at the declared first Peniche recipient |
| allowed_use | Declared matching wild Berlengas manual-scraping route with actual reporting period, physical receipt and transparent attributed upstream supplies |
| excluded_use | Other species/origins/routes, cultivation, edible-only conversion, processed/frozen products, post-recipient retail, safety/legal/stock status claims or unresolved cards as final TIDAS exchanges |
| required_metadata | Species/origin/technique; route and nodes; trip/lot/period; net-mass deductions; grade/live state; physical recipient; actual holding/presentation; assets/services and ownership; all intended outputs and fates |
| required_quality_disclosure | Record coverage, weighing/conversion uncertainty, failed duty and stock balance, attribution rationale/sensitivity, ecological limitations, provisional range evidence and exchange-identity gaps |
| update_trigger | Actual species/origin/route/gate or condition change; revised measured duty/grade/stock records; asset/service scope change; improved ecological, range or identity evidence |
