# Farmed freshwater food fish, live, fresh or chilled

## 1. Scope and Applicability

This PCR guides foreground dataset production for aquaculture-origin non-Salmonidae freshwater food fish, delivered whole, unheaded and ungutted at the first producer farm harvest/dispatch handover. Each lot declares actual live, fresh or chilled state. Actual pond, freshwater-cage, flow-through/raceway and RAS configurations are covered through evidenced records; common carp is an illustrative representative, not a recipe for every species.

Exclude wild capture, ornamental fish, non-food seed/feed as final output, Salmonidae, frozen products, head/gut-removed fish and fillets or other independent processing. Purchased seed stays an input; own seed production is included where actual. Historical FAO descriptions support qualitative route examples and supply no current default ration, density, drug, survival or emission factor.

Accepted net wet fish biomass excludes containers, carrier water, ice and rejects. The 1 kg is a reporting normalization definition, not a prescribed individual fish or internal-transfer amount. A final data package must contain every qualifier; unknown state cannot default to live or fresh.

## 4. Measurement and Unit Rules

| rule_id | Applies to | Required property | Required unit | Rule |
| --- | --- | --- | --- | --- |
| `reference_net_mass` | reference product | Mass `93a60a56-a3c8-11da-a746-0800200b9a66` | kg | Use cp_gate calibrated weighing for accepted whole-fish net wet mass, excluding container/water/ice tare; drainage, repeated sampling, rejects and lot gate must be traceable. |
| `seed_count_mass` | seed and fish stock | Mass `93a60a56-a3c8-11da-a746-0800200b9a66` | kg | Count multiplied by representative individual wet mass of the same cohort/stage; retain distribution and uncertainty, no universal count/kg or fixed 1 kg juvenile quantity. |
| `input_material_basis` | feed; fertilizer; chemical; sludge | Mass `93a60a56-a3c8-11da-a746-0800200b9a66` | kg | Declare wet/dry material mass, moisture, elemental N/P and active ingredient; element/substance conversion needs evidenced molecular/specification basis; wet sludge is not dry solids. |
| `water_density` | water rows | Mass `93a60a56-a3c8-11da-a746-0800200b9a66` | kg | Convert volume to mass using actual density/condition, retain raw m3; distinguish withdrawal, supply, circulation and net consumption. |

## 5. System Boundary

### Boundary Abstraction

| Field | Value |
| --- | --- |
| declared_starting_condition | Actual opening culture stock and purchased seed receipt, or documented on-site founders/breeding/nursery; declare cohort route and existing facility condition |
| starting_condition_role | Foreground entry fact, not a justification for zero upstream burden or absent broodstock history |
| product_classification_scope | Narrower whole unheaded/ungutted non-Salmonidae food scope within CPC 04212; routes selected semantically, not from code |
| recursive_input_rule | Same-category purchased seed/stock retains actual mass and supplier-gate upstream data; stop foreground recursion at declared receipt and disclose supplier boundary, no zero burden or duplicate own hatchery |
| upstream_dataset_requirement | Compatible secondary datasets for actual seed/feed/fertilizer/chemical/water/energy/packaging/asset/transport suppliers; disclose geography/year/technology/gate/allocation and gaps |
| disclosure | Selected nodes, cohort/technology topology, production cycles/carried stock, co-output destinations, asset consumers/life, upstream support/exclusions, actual gate state and uncertainty |

### Boundary Rules

| rule_id | Applies to | Rule | source_ids |
| --- | --- | --- | --- |
| `boundary_gate` | whole foreground system | Include actual aquaculture seed receipt or on-site breeding, managed grow-out, physical harvest and actual producer-controlled preservation/loading through first farm handover; classify whole live/fresh/chilled fish by actual lot state. Independently operated post-gate transport and processing are outside. | `fao-carp-2009`; `fao-freshwater-marketing` |
| `boundary_seed` | own_seed; growout | Parent growout is required. Own breeding/nursery changes topology to founders, nursery inputs and internal juvenile output; purchased seed changes provider/upstream hatchery requirements. The two routes are exclusive for each cohort; mixed farms identify and sum distinct cohorts, without duplicating hatchery burdens. | `fao-carp-2009` |
| `boundary_technology` | growout; farm_services | Declare actual unit-to-technology map under growout. Pond units require natural productivity/fertilizer and sediment records; cages require net/mooring and receiving-water releases; flow-through/raceways require intake/outlet and pumping records; RAS requires makeup/recirculation distinction, filtration media, sludge and treatment energy. One technology per unit-stage interval unless a documented hybrid partitions flows; coexistence across units requires shares and transfer links. | `fao-carp-2009`; `ufifas-ras-fa099` |
| `boundary_upstream` | all external inputs | Include provider production and attributable pre-gate transport for seed, feed, manure/fertilizer, chemicals, energy, packaging and infrastructure; declare inventory start conditions and supporting secondary datasets. Integrated manure has an evidenced burden/attribution decision, never automatic zero. Own seed has internal inputs instead of adding purchased hatchery burden for the same cohort. | `ghg-product-allocation-2011` |
| `boundary_periods` | all selected nodes | Enumerate broodstock/seed phase, nursery and grow-out cycles, partial harvests, fallow/cleaning periods, holding and dispatch intervals, and shared-asset construction, maintenance, replacement and retirement. Opening/closing fish, feed, water and material stocks carry between periods with event links. | `fao-carp-2009`; `ghg-product-allocation-2011` |
| `boundary_water` | farm_services; growout | Keep supplied water, fresh abstraction, recirculation, direct returns, treatment effluent, evaporation and storage changes in one linked water ledger. Assign actual receiving medium and nutrient substance; count each pollutant once across untreated release or wastewater treatment routes. Ecological observations, escape and natural pond production are records, not fabricated elementary identities. | `ufifas-ras-fa099` |
| `boundary_shared` | farm_services | Identify each pump, pond, aerator, raceway, cage/net/mooring, RAS filter, cold unit and tank actually shared by at least two nodes or periods; list all consumers and service periods. Record measured service shares and provider/material/end-of-life burdens once in the central ledger; exclusive assets use direct assignment. | `ghg-product-allocation-2011` |

## 6. Process Inventory Structure

Declare actual culture batches, continuous units or overlapping cohorts; link every input/output, cleaning/changeover/fallow event to cohort, unit and period. growout is the required biological parent; own seed is its production-route delta and pond/cage/flow-through/RAS are its technology deltas. Partition mixed farms by actual unit-stage rather than completing every alternative for one cohort.

farm_services owns one water, power, fuel and asset ledger, with every actual consumer among own_seed, growout, harvest, preservation and dispatch and its period. Other nodes link service shares without repeating totals. Harvest independently owns physical removal and loss classification; preservation owns actual usable-state stabilization; dispatch owns protection/presentation and first producer handover, with independent later distribution outside.

Conditional semantic cards expand to zero, one or multiple concrete exchanges from actual records; each material/substance and UUID needs verification. Provisional finite ranges are site-applicable order-of-magnitude QA screens only, not inventory substitutes; actual records take precedence and out-of-screen observations need explanation. Every internal fish amount is collected, never inherited from final 1 kg.

| `growout` | Managed freshwater grow-out | required | Actual pond, freshwater cage, flow-through/raceway or RAS units; alternatives share this required parent | managed biological production parent | per 1 kg reference flow; retain actual node output |
| `farm_services` | Farm services and shared assets | required | Actual utility and infrastructure consumers across selected seed, grow-out, harvest, preservation and dispatch nodes | one attributed utility and asset ledger | per 1 kg reference flow; retain actual node output |
| `harvest` | Physical harvest | required | Actual removal from culture units; partial and complete harvest events declared | biomass removal and loss classification | per 1 kg reference flow; retain actual node output |

###### Market-size fish biomass handed to harvest (`grown_stock`)

The managed production hand-off is still live cultured stock, before physical removal. Record species, culture unit, batch, actual wet biomass and partial-harvest stock remaining; growth is a biological gain, not a mass-conservative seed transfer.

###### Grow-out mortalities removed to waste treatment (`growout_mortalities`)

Specify cause, wet biomass, removal date and handler; saleable recovered product requires a separate evidenced product role. Escape events are reported in stock/ecological records and are not invented waste or elementary fish flows.

###### Externally supplied treated process water (`treated_water_supply`)

Applicable only to actual purchased treated industrial process-quality water with documented fish-use suitability at delivery. It excludes own freshwater withdrawal, recirculation and wastewater; supplier treatment burden is counted once.

This is one actual externally supplied water exchange, not an assumed industrial process-water supply. Retain its measured quantity and actual source, treatment, grade, salinity and use. Verify fitness for the actual animal-contact, carrier, washing or ice-making purpose and resolve the exact actual supply identity independently before dataset completion; no industrial-water UUID is inherited.

###### Purchased CN low-voltage grid-average AC electricity (`cn_lv_electricity`)

Applicable only where actual supplier/location/voltage evidence matches CN consumption mix to user, AC below 1 kV. Other electricity configurations use electricity_other; this condition does not restrict fish geography.

Conditional identity: this binding applies only to actual purchased Chinese grid-average consumption-mix alternating current below 1 kV delivered to this node. Verify geography, voltage, supplier/mix and actual consumption; other regions, voltages, contracted mixes or own generation require independent identities and records. No supply or use is assumed.

###### Electricity from other actual supply configurations (`electricity_other`)

For every other purchased or imported electricity country, voltage or supplier mix, specify the actual delivered supply and support property. Self-generated power is tracked through actual fuel/generation records without a second purchased-electricity burden; do not reuse a CN identity or duplicate cn_lv_electricity for the same meter interval.

###### Purchased useful heat delivered to farm operations (`purchased_useful_heat`)

Include only actual externally supplied useful heat with supplier, heat-carrier/delivery gate, temperature or pressure and measured delivered energy. Attribute to actual seed, grow-out, holding or cleaning consumers; supplier fuel/combustion burden stays upstream and is not duplicated as farm fuel.

##### Waste flows

###### Non-viable whole harvested fish sent to disposal (`harvest_rejects`)

Only non-viable whole fish actually rejected and handed to the documented waste recipient, by species, event and measured wet fish mass. Exclude incidental sediment, gear and other materials, live stock remaining in production, saleable fish and free drainage. Every actual non-fish material still requires its own identified atomic exchange and destination under the existing waste collection protocol; missing identity blocks completion, not a zero.

This card records only the named atomic exchange, retaining the existing collection protocol, attribution and reference denominator. Use actual records for its own quantity, never a copied parent or sibling total; unknown occurrence or identity is not zero.

## 7. Allocation and Co-product Handling

| rule_id | Applies to | Rule | source_ids |
| --- | --- | --- | --- |
| `allocate_subdivide` | all intended outputs | First subdivide separately measured species, cohorts, culture units and harvest/handling operations. Enumerate all intended food fish, sold seed/broodstock, other polyculture fish and integrated crop/animal outputs with actual purpose, hand-off and destination before attribution. Internal transfers cancel; no substitution credit is automatic. | `ghg-product-allocation-2011` |
| `allocate_common` | shared inputs and intended co-products | For residual joint burdens use a evidenced causal physical relationship: directly metered consumption, feed uptake/growth requirement or documented service use as appropriate. Wet mass alone is not assumed causal across trophic fish/crops. If causality cannot be supported, disclose economic allocation using contemporaneous gate prices and quantities, with a physical-basis sensitivity and rationale. | `ghg-product-allocation-2011` |
| `allocate_period_assets` | periods; farm_services | Attribute broodstock, pond/cage/RAS assets, replacements, shared power/water and cleaning/fallow events to all documented consumers and service periods using observed service lives and usage records. Connect partial harvests to one opening/closing-stock ledger. Fractions sum to one for each shared burden; remaining/retired stock and stranded burdens are disclosed without double annualization. | `ghg-product-allocation-2011` |
| `allocate_waste` | waste and rejects | Waste disposal burdens remain with the generating activity. A sold purposeful output is classified as a product with an attribution decision, never also waste; unsold/dead fish, sludge and packaging follow actual treatment records. Death/escape/weight-change bookkeeping does not become an accepted reference output. | `ghg-product-allocation-2011` |

### Calculation Rules

| rule_id | Applies to | Formula or rule | Inputs | Output | source_ids |
| --- | --- | --- | --- | --- | --- |
| `normalize_lot` | all inventory rows | Divide each actual attributed quantity once by accepted whole-fish net wet mass from the same production boundary, yielding per 1 kg reference flow; the reference product is defined as 1 kg. Internal transfers retain actual amounts and cancel on aggregation; already normalized values are not divided again. | actual amount; allocation fraction; cp_gate | row quantity on same reference basis |  |
| `feed_use_reconciliation` | dq_complete_nursery_feed; dq_complete_growout_feed | For each actual feed product, node, cohort and period, measure the mass actually offered at the final feeding point using a calibrated delivery meter or a completed feeding-event balance: prepared feed mass minus unused returned feed, unused feed retained at that point and independently measured pre-offering losses within that event. These three deductions are disjoint; retained unoffered feed remains stock. Do not subtract those event losses again if the delivery meter already measures feed after them. Add separately evidenced pre-offering storage/handling feed losses inside the declared foreground boundary, attributable under Section 7, to obtain the feed-input quantity; retain their upstream feed burdens and count each loss once. Exclude supplier losses already covered by the upstream feed dataset or a complete supplied service. Do not deduct feed already offered but left uneaten; record its actual fate separately. Warehouse issues and returns are internal transfers, not additional feed use or purchases. For each named store and owner, reconcile opening stock plus all inward receipts, including physical returns, against closing stock, all outward transfers and independently measured losses; retain product/moisture basis, measured state transformations and uncertainty. Record stock change as closing minus opening at that same store only for reconciliation; never subtract it again from the offered-feed-plus-loss quantity. Carry unused closing stock and its burdens to later periods, reconcile all consumer shares and do not count a shared loss again at its source node. Missing records or unexplained differences remain gaps, never zero or balancing feed. Attribute once under Section 7 and normalize once under normalize_lot; no ration, loss rate or range default is supplied. | cp_inputs_own_seed; cp_inputs_growout; cp_inputs_farm_services; completed feeding events; store/transfer/loss ledgers; cp_gate | Attributable feed quantity and independent stock reconciliation before normalize_lot | `feed-ledger-method` |
| `stock_reconcile` | own_seed; growout; harvest | Reconcile opening stock plus receipts/births and estimated biological growth against transfers/harvest, mortality/escape and closing stock by cohort, retaining residual and uncertainty. Count uses same-stage representative wet mass and actual samples; seed mass conservation does not constrain growth. | cp_stock_own_seed; cp_stock_growout; cp_stock_harvest | cohort transfer quantities and stock residuals |  |
| `resource_reconcile` | farm_services | Reconcile supplied/abstracted/returned/treated/circulated water and storage by meter interval using actual density. Electricity kWh times 3.6 yields MJ; reconcile fuel stock/consumption independently. Attribute utilities by recorded node/period shares summing to one. | cp_water_growout; cp_water_farm_services; cp_energy | water/energy ledgers and node attribution |  |
| `direct_emission_model` | dq_complete_aqueous_nutrient_releases; fossil_co2_air; dq_complete_other_direct_releases | For each actual aqueous substance and receiving medium, record total outward load from the matched discharge volume and measured concentration over the same interval, with documented unit and element/compound conversion. Independently retain every inlet volume and concentration, sludge removal, fish retention, storage and other destinations. A concentration difference multiplied only by outlet volume is not a general net-load method when inlet/outlet volumes or background fates differ. Use a background-adjusted inventory only with an explicit substance-specific method proving the inlet contribution that actually reaches this outlet, its fate, compatible boundaries and a single adjustment; report total outward load and the net balance diagnostic separately, never as two inventories of the same release. A negative net diagnostic is not automatically negative emission, removal credit or zero. Any source-specific balance/factor model must state its applicability, inputs, formula, provenance and uncertainty. Fossil CO2 requires actual fuel and independently evidenced matching carbon/oxidation factors; missing factors remain gaps, never inferred from a UUID. | cp_emissions_own_seed; cp_emissions_growout; cp_emissions_farm_services; cp_emissions_harvest; cp_emissions_preservation; cp_emissions_dispatch; cp_inputs_own_seed; cp_inputs_growout; cp_inputs_farm_services; cp_inputs_harvest; cp_inputs_preservation; cp_inputs_dispatch; cp_stock_own_seed; cp_stock_growout; cp_stock_harvest; cp_energy | substance releases and uncertainty | `ufifas-ras-fa099` |
| `joint_service_attribution` | co-outputs; shared assets; periods | Apply Section 7 subdivision, evidenced physical causality then disclosed economic fallback; attribute asset material/end-of-life burden over observed service periods and actual use to all nodes/periods, checking fraction sums and sensitivity. | cp_outputs_own_seed; cp_outputs_growout; cp_outputs_harvest; cp_assets; cp_energy; cp_water_growout; cp_water_farm_services | single output/period service-attribution ledger | `ghg-product-allocation-2011` |

## 9. Validation Rules

| rule_id | Applies to | Rule | source_ids |
| --- | --- | --- | --- |
| `validate_scope` | reference lot | Verify aquaculture origin, non-Salmonidae species family, human-food purpose, freshwater culture context, whole unheaded/ungutted form, actual live/fresh/chilled state and first producer farmgate; incomplete qualifiers prevent finalization. Do not use a reference name to cover a live-only or landing-site fixed UUID. | `un-cpc3-2025` |
| `validate_route` | own_seed; growout | Require current producer cohort and unit-stage evidence for seed origin and technology flags, required parent growout, explicit own/purchased mutual exclusion, documented hybrids/transfers and resources/deltas. A route label or historical FAO numerical value does not establish actual farm topology or performance. | `fao-carp-2009`; `ufifas-ras-fa099` |
| `validate_mass` | all fish and input records | Check calibrated/tared accepted net fish mass and count-to-wet-mass sampling; match each internal transfer once, distinguish biological growth from opening stock, receipt, harvest, mortality, escape and closing stock. Retain explicit uncertainty/residuals; do not force juveniles or harvest input to 1 kg. |  |
| `validate_utilities` | farm_services; growout | Reconcile water, energy and provider ledgers; CN low-voltage identity is conditional, other supply stays distinct. Confirm numerator property/unit, supplied versus abstracted water, species/element nutrient basis and receiving medium; prevent supplier/direct emission and effluent/substance duplication. | `ufifas-ras-fa099` |
| `validate_modes_outputs` | all processes and allocation | Audit batch/continuous interval links, cleaning/changeovers/fallow burdens, intended-output completeness and hand-offs, period and shared-consumer fractions, and single assignment of each harvested lot. Actual no-use/bypass evidence is required for zero conditional resources; missing observation is not zero. | `ghg-product-allocation-2011` |
| `validate_quality` | all exchanges | Every concrete final exchange needs a verified matching flow identity and support property/unit; unresolved cards require later actual-exchange verification. Each provisional Range is a replaceable QA screen, not an allowed limit, default inventory value or medication/performance target. Values outside it trigger explanation and evidence review rather than forced clipping. |  |
| `validate_handling` | harvest; preservation; dispatch | Select actual pre-gate holding/chilling from timestamp, state and operation evidence; verify survival/temperature observations and segregated rejects, drainage, ice and package tare. Exclude independent post-gate distribution, freezing and head/gut-removal processing. | `fao-freshwater-marketing` |
| `validate_feed` | dq_complete_nursery_feed; dq_complete_growout_feed | Check feed_use_reconciliation and the linked raw protocols: final-point offered mass, disjoint unused returns/retained stock/event losses in any feeding-event balance, all pre-offering losses and once-only attribution, separate uneaten-feed fate, named store/owner/period and gross-transfer stock reconciliation. Do not treat a warehouse issue as offered feed or deduct stock change again; missing measurements, unassigned losses or unexplained differences block completion. | `feed-ledger-method` |
| `validate_inventory_completion` | all concrete exchanges and section 8 completion obligations | Verify each applicable dq_complete obligation has separately measured and identity-verified exchange cards. Check each quantity, native unit, range evidence, normalization, receiving medium, destination and non-duplication. Any unfulfilled actual child exchange, quantity, identity or destination makes the final dataset incomplete and fails validation; unknown cannot be zero. Static PCR checking does not replace this evidence. |  |
