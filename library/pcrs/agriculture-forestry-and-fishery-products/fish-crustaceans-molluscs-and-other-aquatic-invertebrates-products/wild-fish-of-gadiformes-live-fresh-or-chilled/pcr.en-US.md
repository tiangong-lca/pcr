# Wild marine head-on gutted Gadiformes fish, fresh or chilled

## 1. Scope and Applicability

This method covers producer wild marine capture through the first food handover of Gadiformes fish with head retained and viscera removed, fresh or nonfrozen chilled. Actual producer-responsible gut removal must be complete; resale of fish purchased after a supplier first gate is outside this route. There is no universal gear, temperature, duration, yield or legal threshold; retain actual market and competent-authority food-acceptance evidence. Unknown state cannot default to acceptance. Exclude inland Gadiformes such as burbot, farmed fish, final live/ungutted fish, headed fish, fillets, organs as reference, frozen/thawed fish, cooked/smoked/salted products and final seed/feed/ornamental uses.

## 4. Measurement and Unit Rules

| rule_id | Applies to | Required property | Required unit | Rule |
| --- | --- | --- | --- | --- |
| reference_mass | reference product | Mass `93a60a56-a3c8-11da-a746-0800200b9a66` | kg | Use calibrated weighing of accepted head-on gutted carcass retaining natural tissue moisture; deduct packaging, ice and free water. Whole catch and gutted fish require separate measurements without default conversion. |
| energy_identity | electricity and energy inputs | Net calorific value `93a60a56-a3c8-11da-a746-0800200c9a66` | MJ | Retain energy with verified energy unit group `93a60a57-a3c8-11da-a746-0800200c9a66`; original kWh multiplied by 3.6 gives MJ. Do not replace energy with fuel mass or kg of service; fuel composition and method need separate evidence. |
| physical_ledger | mass transfers and water | Mass `93a60a56-a3c8-11da-a746-0800200b9a66` | kg | Keep unallocated mass by actual material/state at each event, recording tare, drainage, tissue/free water, ice, organs and stocks. Constituent loads characterizing a water stream are not added again to its mass. Actual service functional units and non-mass interactions remain auxiliary ledgers. |

## 5. System Boundary

### Boundary Abstraction

| Field | Value |
| --- | --- |
| declared_starting_condition | Wild marine stock before actual producer capture; real trip, vessel/gear and asset service records. |
| starting_condition_role | Environment-to-capture origin and attributable resource start, not a burden-free purchased gutted input. |
| product_classification_scope | Marine wild head-on gutted fresh/chilled subset of CPC 3.0 04241. |
| recursive_input_rule | Same-category fish bought after a first producer gate cannot replace own capture; resale is excluded. Actual purchased bait remains its own input with supplier burden. Internal fish transfers use paired ids and no duplicated upstream capture. |
| upstream_dataset_requirement | Trace actual fuel, electricity, bait, consumables, water, ice, packages, capital and external service supply; record unresolved interfaces, not zero burdens. |
| disclosure | Declare ownership, marine source, actual gate, event sequence, time/grade states, scope of inclusive services, complete voyage/asset periods and exclusions. |

### Boundary Rules

| rule_id | Applies to | Rule | source_ids |
| --- | --- | --- | --- |
| boundary_sequence | actual event graph | Table order is not a mandatory route. Prove actual capture, gutting, grading, preservation and presentation sequence using event/pass and paired transfer ids, preserving pending status. A parcel becomes reference output only after gutting, acceptance and nonfrozen requirements all hold. | fao-wet-fish-handling; fao-inshore-fish-handling |
| boundary_trip | trip and shared resources | Attribute complete trip, idle/maintenance, replacement and actual asset-service periods to true consumers and periods; at-sea handover does not erase return resources or extend post-gate physical handling. Capture owns propulsion and shared onboard generation once. |  |
| boundary_services | external and shared services | Keep actual outsourced gutting, cleaning, chilling, ice manufacture and pre-gate movement in each node auxiliary service ledger with real invoiced functional unit, quantity, supplier data, contract scope and covered-resource matrix; never invent kg of service. Unverified service units/support identities remain blocking interfaces, not omitted burdens or a complete final inventory; separately inventory only non-inclusive resources. |  |
| boundary_water | water and residues | Record actual purchased/abstracted water, recirculation make-up, paired internal water/ice transfers, meltwater, product-carried water, releases, treatment, independently evidenced evaporation and opening/closing stocks. Recirculation is not new abstraction, melting is not new supply, and constituent loads do not duplicate whole-water mass. Each material parcel has one fate. |  |
| boundary_technology | capture parent and deltas | Under capture parent prove actual event-specific trawl/net/hook technology deltas in topology, energy, bait/gear materials, bycatch/loss and habitat-interaction categories. Never duplicate full catch or shared resources for one event or claim universally minimal impact. | noaa-atlantic-cod |

## 6. Process Inventory Structure

### Process Map

| process_id | process_name | inclusion | inclusion_condition | role | quantitative_reference |
| --- | --- | --- | --- | --- | --- |
| `capture` | Wild marine capture and complete voyage responsibility | required | Always for fish from the declared producer capture events. | foreground capture | Measured target whole catch removed from the marine stock; not fixed to final gutted kg. |
| `condition` | Head-on evisceration and initial cleaning | required | Actual producer-responsible gut removal occurs before this reference product can be handed over. | foreground condition | Measured actually partial or completed head-on fish transfers and every removed organ, blood, liquid, reject and stock partition at the actual pass; final reference requires completed gutting. |
| `grade` | Actual physical and destination grading | required | Classify species, form, condition, food acceptance and actual destinations before final handover. | foreground grade | Measured accepted, downgraded/other intended and waste fish for each grading pass. |
| `preserve` | Actual nonfreezing chilling and bounded cold holding | conditional | Producer performs actual chilling or cold holding before first handover, at any evidenced position in the event sequence. | foreground preserve | Measured actual fish state entering and leaving each cold intervention, with time and temperature history. |
| `present` | Producer protective presentation | conditional | Actual producer packaging, boxing or labelling of head-on gutted food fish before handover. | foreground present | Actual prepared fish excluding boxes, liners, free water and ice; separate package ledger. |
| `handover` | First producer food handover and reference weighing | required | Exactly one actual first producer gate per accepted reference lot; sea, landing or other documented gate. | foreground handover | 1 kg accepted net head-on gutted marine wild Gadiformes fresh/chilled food carcass. |

Cards define actual roles; conditional roles occur only where records demonstrate them and expand by real substance, supplier and destination. Each card first keeps an unallocated physical ledger: close actual transfers, losses and stocks, then normalize to positive accepted final carcass kg, owning shared node/period resources once. A separate single-output LCA view attributes burdens only once under section 7 while retaining the unallocated ledger and allocation matrix; never multiply fish/organ mass partitions by economic shares or apply downstream output shares twice. Provisional ranges are replaceable screening estimates, not default amounts, empirically allowed intervals or QA-pass evidence; investigate independently evidenced values outside a range, never clip them.

### Process: Wild marine capture and complete voyage responsibility (`capture`)

Identify waterbody, wild species, trip and gear event. Capture removes whole fish; it neither grows fish nor removes viscera. The whole-catch transfer enters actual conditioning, grading or preservation. Record trawl/net/line/rod technology under this parent: towing/hauling energy, hooks/bait, gear materials, lost gear, bycatch and habitat interactions differ. Gear types are mutually exclusive for one event unless measured mixed use is partitioned; disjoint events can coexist. Include attributable outward, fishing, return, idle, maintenance and asset-service periods even after at-sea product handover; do not extend physical product handling past its gate. Other retained species are intended outputs only with actual destination evidence.

### Process: Head-on evisceration and initial cleaning (`condition`)

The first pass receives whole ungutted wild Gadiformes, possibly already graded or chilled. Retain the head; declare actual gill retention/removal and bleeding. Record viscera removal when actually performed, including liver/roe destinations; no universal yields. A partial pass does not imply completed gutting, and a later receiving pass can accept that measured partially prepared transfer. A real partial initial pass may hand still-ungutted head-retained fish to an intervening cold/grade event, using condition_partially_prepared_fish, actual states and paired transfers before a later completed-gutting pass; this adds no universal killing or bleeding step. Subsequent cleaning passes may receive already gutted carcasses and must not remove the same organs twice. Prepared carcasses pass to the next actual grade/preservation/presentation event. Sold organs/offal require intended-use and acceptance evidence; waste to treatment and permitted direct environmental release are exclusive fates for each parcel. Washing and draining record water entry, product-carried water, effluent and stocks, not an assumed fish-yield conversion.

###### Actual head-retained fish transferred before gutting is complete (`condition_partially_prepared_fish`)

Only a real intermediate pass handing still-ungutted or partly prepared head-retained fish to an actual next node, for example a documented cold intervention before later gut removal. Record actual live/dead, bleeding, gut/gill, grade and thermal state, measured raw mass and paired event/pass/transfer ids. Keep gutting pending; pair its later return with the actual receiving pass. This is mutually exclusive for the same parcel/pass with completed gutted output, not a second carcass sale or fixed final 1 kg. Final handover still requires completed evisceration and all food/nonfrozen qualifiers.

### Process: Actual physical and destination grading (`grade`)

Receive the actual whole or gutted, fresh/chilled incoming state. Record grade criteria and decision authority. Accepted reference-form food fish go onward; whole ungutted fish accepted for later preparation are pending conditioning, never final reference output. Downgraded but saleable fish, non-reference forms and other species retain their own product identity/destination. Truly discarded fish go to waste treatment or actual permitted environment release, never both. Regrading follows a new event/pass; no automatic repetition of captured biomass.

### Process: Actual nonfreezing chilling and bounded cold holding (`preserve`)

Receive usable whole or gutted fish, before or after grading and presentation as actually evidenced. Preserve exactly that declared nonfrozen state; retain pending grading/conditioning status rather than granting acceptance. Record actual ice or mechanical cold service, input water, heat/energy and measured melt/drain streams. Stale/rejected fish are losses with a destination, not accepted product. No universal temperature, holding time, ice ratio or guarantee that chilling repairs a previous unsafe history. Frozen/thawed output leaves this reference scope.

### Process: Producer protective presentation (`present`)

Receive head-on gutted fish with the actual pending or accepted food-grade status; packaging cannot grant food acceptance. Protected fish go to the next actual cold/grading event or handover only if all eligibility conditions hold. Distinguish disposable boxes/liners/labels from reusable containers, their stock, replacement and cleaning. Record physical package handover separately from attributed manufacture of reusable assets. Distribution and later merchant transport are outside this node; pre-gate movement and service ownership remain explicit auxiliary records.

### Process: First producer food handover and reference weighing (`handover`)

Receive only fish whose actual head-on gutted form, species, food acceptance and nonfrozen history meet this boundary, whether boxed or unboxed. Weigh drained fish net of package, free water and ice; retain natural body moisture, head and actual retained gills. Packaging is neither edible fish nor automatically an economic co-product. Unknown state or safety acceptance blocks the final denominator. Physical fish handling ends at this gate; attributable later return-voyage/asset burdens remain with their owning period and node.

###### Actual dead whole-fish or carcass material released to water at handover (`handover_actual_dead_fish_release`)

Only actual documented direct environmental fate of rejected/dead whole fish or carcass at this pass; identify species, head/gut/gill state, raw mass, event, receiving water and applicable management/authorization evidence. Not a prescribed legal disposal route. Keep removed organ/blood fates, wastewater constituents, treatment-bound fish, intended products and stocks separate; never count the same material twice or relabel it as a capture-stage loss.

## 7. Allocation and Co-product Handling

| rule_id | Applies to | Rule | source_ids |
| --- | --- | --- | --- |
| allocation_views | physical ledger and single-output LCA | Always retain two views: an unallocated physical ledger closes captured biomass, organs, carcasses, water/ice, products and wastes; LCA attribution allocates burdens without changing physical partitions. Own shared resources at one node/period first, then attribute once at each actual relevant output boundary, never applying final output shares again. |  |
| allocation_outputs | intended outputs and residues | Enumerate actual sold reference fish, other species/grades, accepted liver/roe/other organs or offal and usable bait, with each actual handover/use. Internal transfers, packages, water/ice and stocks are not automatically economic co-products; waste does not become product through hypothetical value. |  |
| allocation_precedence | joint capture and preparation burdens | First subdivide truly independently measured activities. Allocate residual joint burdens by demonstrable physical relationship only with product-specific causal evidence; otherwise use contemporaneous actual net-revenue shares at the relevant boundary, retaining mass, price, revenue, currency, period and sensitivity. Zero/missing prices, no positive total revenue or unresolved output sets block economic allocation, without default mass allocation or system expansion; no automatic avoided-burden credit. |  |
| allocation_periods | trip runs assets and shared infrastructure | Index trips, capture events, handling runs and reporting periods; link actual cleaning/changeovers to served runs. Allocate vessels, generators, cold systems, tools and reusable boxes by actual service life, replacement/termination and use hours or measured causal driver to consumers and periods, retaining totals and weights summing to 1. Retain no-output, failed, return and idle burdens through the same actual service-period ledger, never deleting them or annualizing twice. |  |

### Calculation Rules

| rule_id | Applies to | Formula or rule | Inputs | Output | source_ids |
| --- | --- | --- | --- | --- | --- |
| physical_normalization | all inventory rows | First close actual unallocated fish, organs, water/ice, other inputs, real fates and stock changes, independently investigating unmeasured differences; normalize truly owned resources by dividing raw quantity by positive accepted final net carcass kg. Retain a separate single-output LCA burden-attribution view with section 7 matrix, without multiplying mass partitions by economic shares or applying final output shares twice. | cp_capture; cp_condition; cp_grade; cp_preserve; cp_present; cp_handover | Unallocated physical per-reference view and separate LCA attribution view |  |
| gutting_balance | condition | Actual fish and water/ice/other receipts plus opening stock equal mutually exclusive actual partial-condition fish transfers, completed gutted carcass transfers, sold organs, organs/rejects to management, direct releases, each water fate and closing stock at that pass; close blood and water loads using a nonduplicate convention. Do not assume prepared net carcass equals received whole fish. | cp_condition | Independently evidenced mass closure and discrepancy investigation |  |
| unit_conversion | all inventory rows | Original kWh multiplied by 3.6 gives MJ; original t multiplied by 1000 gives kg, g multiplied by 0.001 gives kg. Retain raw units, conversions and property evidence; do not mass-convert real service functional units. | raw units; verified support groups | Consistent units with original quantities |  |
| service_range | external service cards | Expand services by provider, scope and actual native functional unit; provider_service_unit is not a controlled unit. Each U_<node>_external_service is a nonnegative finite upper bound supported by matching independent comparable service-period data or matching supplier evidence, normalized to positive accepted final net fish kg. Retain raw quantities, functional unit, denominator, scope, coverage period and independent applicability rationale; never self-validate from the same batch maximum. Without evidence retain the symbol and property/unit-group gaps, without claiming quantitative Range QA or final exchange completion. | actual provider units; independent service evidence; node protocol | Evidenced service bounds or retained gaps |  |
| range_review | non-reference ranges | Role-specific upper screens are provisional broad estimates per 1 kg reference flow: fish/organs 100 kg, bait/consumables/gear 20 kg, packages 10 kg, water 10000 kg, gate carrier water/ice 1000 kg, purchased ice 20 kg, direct fuel 100 kg, fossil CO2 400 kg, other air substances 20 kg, refrigerants 5 kg and energy 1000 MJ; none is an empirical QA threshold. Near-zero output can exceed them: never clip actual values. Independently comparable data or matching supplier evidence must establish applicability before final inventory QA. | role; independent observations; supplier scope | Evidenced range or quantitative evidence gap |  |
| conditional_interface_envelopes | condition_actual_live_fish_return; condition_actual_dead_fish_release; grade_actual_live_fish_return; grade_actual_dead_fish_release; preserve_actual_live_fish_return; preserve_actual_dead_fish_release; present_actual_dead_fish_release; handover_actual_dead_fish_release; condition_partially_prepared_fish; dq_complete_handover_direct_fuel; handover_electricity; dq_complete_handover_operating_materials; dq_complete_handover_external_service; dq_complete_handover_operating_waste; handover_fossil_co2; dq_complete_handover_other_direct_release; dq_complete_present_actual_alternative_fish_product; dq_complete_handover_actual_alternative_fish_product | For each listed conditional role, instantiate actual identity/state/node/pass/numerator unit and matching positive final kg before quantitative QA. U_<row_id> is a finite nonnegative same-unit upper on the explicitly labelled physical or LCA view, established from a separate representative campaign maximum times a predeclared margin >=1, or a matching independent supplier/design envelope. Retain independent source/raw samples, scope, conversion, denominator, view and uncertainty; never use the target batch maximum to validate itself. A symbol, provisional old screen or checker pass supplies no numeric evidence. Service unit/property/unitgroup gaps remain blockers; actual kg-handled is allowed only for a verified native provider reference. No clipping or invented zero. | independent campaign/supplier evidence; actual role and unit; final kg; declared view | independently evidenced U bounds or explicit unresolved gaps |  |

### Data Quality Requirements

| requirement_id | Applies to | Requirement | Evidence |
| --- | --- | --- | --- |
| quality_identity | all roles | Verify exact identity by actual substance, flow type/direction, state, use, geography and receiving compartment. Unverified identities or support units remain gaps; a conceptual card cannot replace a concrete final TIDAS exchange. | Concrete identity and support-data evidence |
| quality_events | fish and organ chain | Reconcile capture, gutting, grading, cold and handover states per event; every organ/blood fate and live return/dead discard needs evidence. Unknown cannot pass. | Event graph, measurements, acceptance and time-temperature records |
| quality_complete | period and resource ownership | Cover complete voyages, failed/no-output periods, shared assets and service inclusion matrix; disclose non-mass ecological interactions instead of claiming no impact. Unresolved quantities, ranges, services and output sets block a complete package. | Period ledger, asset service evidence, coverage matrix and independent review |
| `dq_inventory_completion` | all inventory-completion requirements | Create a separate card for every actual physical or chemical exchange, with process, direction, flow type, its own measured quantity, native unit, final-reference normalization, applicability, destination, UUID and independent range evidence. Never copy a family total, a grouped screening range or one UUID onto every child. Use not_applicable only for evidenced absence; unknown is not zero. Any unfulfilled applicable obligation makes the final dataset incomplete and fails validation. | per-flow coverage ledger, raw measurements, identity, fate and range evidence |
| `dq_complete_capture_bait` | `capture`; inputs; product | Identify and separately collect every actual exchange covered by “Actual supplied bait materials”; retain all following collection, quantity and normalization obligations: Only actual bait-using gear activates this role; expand species/form/source and retain supplier preparation and transport burdens. Actual internally supplied or independently own-caught bait has a paired receipt and its own evidenced upstream capture/preparation responsibility, not a burden-free marine stock or a duplicate of target catch.

Establish each card's own matching-unit/reference-basis upper envelope from independent representative records or a compatible documented supplier/design bound, retaining scope, method and uncertainty. Do not reuse a removed aggregate range, copy a sibling quantity, derive a bound from the target batch itself or invent a value.

## 9. Validation Rules

| rule_id | Applies to | Rule | source_ids |
| --- | --- | --- | --- |
| validate_reference | final output | Only food_handover is final reference. Check marine wild species, head retained/viscera removed, actual gills, food acceptance, nonfrozen history and net mass; unknown cannot enter denominator. One first gate per lot, without duplicating internal transfers. | un-cpc-3-2025 |
| validate_balance | actual physical records | Reconcile gutting mass partitions, water/ice fates, other species, stocks, wastes and sea returns in the unallocated ledger; pair receipts/outputs by same transfer id. Never close economically allocated amounts against unallocated whole fish or fill unexplained differences with evaporation. |  |
| validate_technology | capture and handling events | Check actual parent, technology deltas, event coexistence/exclusion, cleaning/changeovers and repeated-pass ids. Actual trawl/net/hook inputs, bycatch, losses and habitat evidence require real coverage, not completion asserted from candidate routes. | noaa-atlantic-cod |
| validate_attribution | LCA resources and periods | Independently check allocation matrix and unallocated physical view: own each resource once, shares at each boundary sum to 1, no second final share; missing revenue and no output do not erase burdens. Reconcile complete return, asset service, replacement and inclusive-service scope to avoid duplicates. |  |
| validate_ranges | all cards and final package | Check supplied Ranges on the same actual numerator unit, final-reference basis and physical or LCA view. Provisional estimates do not prove plausibility or supply missing amounts. Cards without numerical Ranges retain an independent range/uncertainty evidence need, not a fabricated bound. Before actual exchange completion obtain each instance’s own representative evidence, quantity, identity and real service unit; before numerical QA establish the applicable independent envelope without using the tested batch to validate itself. Preserve and investigate genuine outliers without clipping. |  |
| `validate_inventory_completion` | all concrete exchanges and section 8 completion obligations | Verify each applicable dq_complete obligation has separately measured and identity-verified exchange cards. Check each quantity, native unit, range evidence, normalization, receiving medium, destination and non-duplication. Any unfulfilled actual child exchange, quantity, identity or destination makes the final dataset incomplete and fails validation; unknown cannot be zero. Static PCR checking does not replace this evidence. |  |
