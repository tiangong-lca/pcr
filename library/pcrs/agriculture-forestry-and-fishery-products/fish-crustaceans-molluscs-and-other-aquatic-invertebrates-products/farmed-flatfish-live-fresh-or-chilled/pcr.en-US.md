# Farmed whole flatfish, live, fresh or chilled

## 1. Scope and Applicability

This methodology covers actual aquaculture-origin whole food flatfish at the first producer handover. Confirm the actual species independently within the flatfish classification scope rather than deriving taxonomy from an old species manual. Whole means unheaded and ungutted. Final state is evidenced live or fresh/chilled; species, production phases and water conditions remain actual dataset facts. Use the CPC explanatory notes for classification scope and the explicitly defined foreground method for this narrower gate and form.

Historical FAO turbot and flounder descriptions support qualitative phase questions only. Their old performance, temperature, density, FCR, drug, price, taxonomy and embryo-duration statements are not current quantitative defaults or prescriptions. Current site records determine actual reproduction, health materials, salinity, water technology and conditions. The general UF/IFAS RAS source supports treatment and water-quality questions, not a flatfish production recipe. Sources: `un-cpc3-2025`, `fao-turbot-2009`, `fao-flounder-culture`, `uf-ifas-ras-fa099`, `flatfish-foreground-method`.

## 3. Reference Flow

### Functional Unit

| Field | Value |
| --- | --- |
| What | Actual qualifying whole farmed food flatfish at first producer handover |
| How much | 1 kg net wet fish biomass excluding water, ice, oxygen, packages and nonqualifying rejects |
| How well | Actual species, whole unheaded ungutted form, aquaculture provenance and food suitability; exactly one evidenced live or fresh/chilled state |
| How long or cycle | Record actual broodstock cycles, hatch/larval/settlement/nursery/growout periods, harvest, holding and dispatch dates; include carryover biomass, asset service periods, replacement and terminal events |
| reference_flow_link | `flatfish_gate_release` |

### Reference Flow Object

| Field | Value |
| --- | --- |
| Reference amount | 1 |
| Reference product flow | Whole farmed food flatfish in its declared actual state at first producer handover |
| Reference flow property | Mass `93a60a56-a3c8-11da-a746-0800200b9a66` |
| Reference unit group | Units of mass `93a60a57-a4c8-11da-a746-0800200c9a66` |
| Reference unit | kg |
| Required qualifiers | species/taxon evidence; aquaculture origin; food purpose and suitability; unheaded ungutted whole form; actual live/fresh/chilled state; ownership/purchased starting stage; water source/salinity and topology per unit; cohort/site/period; net mass and tare; bottom area/occupancy; metamorphosis/settlement if owned; harvest/handling/dispatch records; actual first producer gate; upstream burden coverage; treatment/outfall fate; allocation and uncertainty |

Exactly one actual state branch delivers to declared_gate_release: live_gate for evidenced live fish, or whole_chill for evidenced fresh/chilled fish. The final acceptance/release node owns the sole reference output and measured positive accepted net-mass denominator. Its input is the independently measured selected-branch transfer, not fixed to 1 kg. Do not combine branches or infer unknown state. Rejects and losses remain separately measured; split mixed-state lots and retain all qualifiers and shared burdens.


## 4. Measurement and Unit Rules

| rule_id | Applies to | Required property | Required unit | Rule |
| --- | --- | --- | --- | --- |
| `reference_mass` | reference product | Mass `93a60a56-a3c8-11da-a746-0800200b9a66` | kg | Weigh actual qualifying net whole fish on calibrated scales; subtract tare, water, oxygen and ice. Exclude nonqualifying death/rejects from denominator but retain their burdens. Sources: flatfish-foreground-method. |
| `cohort_count_mass` | stock and fish transfers | Mass | kg | Count-to-mass requires actual representative species/stage/cohort sample weights and sampling uncertainty, or direct weighing; no universal fish-per-kg or egg-to-fish conversion. Sources: flatfish-foreground-method. |
| `water_mass` | water cards | Mass | kg | Record volume and actual density/salinity/temperature when converting to kg; source abstraction, supply, circulation and final discharge remain separately identified. Sources: flatfish-foreground-method. |
| `energy_units` | energy cards | Net calorific value | MJ | Preserve original meter/invoice units; convert kWh to MJ by 3.6, distinguish purchased thermal energy from fuel and electricity that generates it. Sources: flatfish-foreground-method. |
| `substance_basis` | feed; chemicals; emissions | Mass | kg | Retain feed wet/dry mass and moisture; formulated material vs active ingredient; N/P elemental vs actual substance basis. Convert only with declared composition, molar relation or measured density. Sources: flatfish-foreground-method. |

## 5. System Boundary

### Boundary Abstraction

| Field | Value |
| --- | --- |
| declared_starting_condition | Actual owned broodstock/egg/larval phase, or documented purchased eggs, larvae or juveniles; continue remaining owned production at the actual stage and retain upstream burdens |
| starting_condition_role | Physical foreground starting stage plus explicit upstream dataset interface |
| product_classification_scope | Aquaculture-origin whole food flatfish subset of CPC 3.0 04232; origin, form, use and gate are independently evidenced |
| recursive_input_rule | Record purchased same-category fish as actual stage-qualified input with upstream dataset boundary; stop recursive authoring at documented supplier gate, never erase upstream production or count it twice |
| upstream_dataset_requirement | Require actual stage/species/origin, supplier gate, geography/time, feed/water/energy coverage, survival/loss and attribution compatibility; missing burdens are explicit data gaps |
| disclosure | Declare owned and purchased phases, all selected water routes, resource/treatment ownership, actual final state, first handover, temporal carryover and excluded post-gate operations |

### Boundary Rules

| rule_id | Applies to | Rule | source_ids |
| --- | --- | --- | --- |
| `boundary_scope` | all processes | Include actual owned pre-gate phases and upstream purchased inputs, harvest and selected handling; stop at first producer handover. Exclude post-gate transport, culture, retail, cooking and consumption. | `flatfish-foreground-method` |
| `boundary_parent` | hatchery; nursery; growout | Attach owned-vs-purchased biological alternatives to their managed-production parent. Actual stage purchase replaces only omitted owned phases; no duplicate nodes or zero-burden seed. | `flatfish-foreground-method` |
| `boundary_biological_delta` | hatchery; nursery; growout | For each actual phase declare one owned or purchased-stage option; different phases may coexist, but the same phase/cohort cannot include both supplier production and owned duplicate production. The delta changes upstream dataset coverage versus owned feed/water/energy/health and emission inventories, phase count/mass and survival calculations, and reproduction/metamorphosis evidence. Select actual natural/induced/artificial reproduction only for an owned reproductive phase and evidence the corresponding handling/material inventory. | `flatfish-foreground-method` |
| `boundary_water` | all water-using processes | Resolve actual flow-through, cage or RAS topology per unit-period; retain source-stage treatment/backwash/disinfection and energy links. Environmental abstraction, supplied water, internal circulation and final discharge are distinct. | `flatfish-foreground-method` |
| `boundary_state` | growout; harvest; live_gate; whole_chill | Activate whole_chill only from actual fresh/chilled dispatch records; inactive requires evidenced live delivery. Preserve state and suitability by event: live fish enter the selected route; naturally dead fish enter whole_chill only with independent evidence that they still qualify as fresh food, otherwise mortality waste; unknown suitability never qualifies as product. The same fish cannot be both product and mortality waste. whole_chill owns actual bounded pre-killing holding and its resources/losses for the fresh/chilled route, with live_gate inactive. Exactly one final output per lot; internal transfers retain measured quantities, not fixed 1 kg. | `flatfish-foreground-method` |
| `boundary_shared` | all processes | Meter or allocate shared pumps, oxygenation, heating/cooling, biofilters, discharge treatment, broodstock and tanks/cages across every actual consumer, cohort and period once; retain service-life, replacement, termination and residual capacity records. | `flatfish-foreground-method` |
| `boundary_fate` | all processes | Record mortalities, rejects, escapes, spent feed/cultures, wastewater/sludge, combustion and refrigerant/substance releases at source stages. Link internal treatment transfers to final fate once; no unobserved absence becomes zero. | `flatfish-foreground-method` |

## 6. Process Inventory Structure

### Process Map

| process_id | process_name | inclusion | inclusion_condition | role | quantitative_reference |
| --- | --- | --- | --- | --- | --- |
| `hatchery` | Broodstock, incubation and larval flatfish production | conditional | Owned broodstock, egg incubation or larval production actually occurs | Foreground responsibility; actual batch or continuous unit-period | per 1 kg reference flow |
| `livefood` | Owned larval live-food cultivation | conditional | Actual in-house algae, rotifer, Artemia or other identified live-food production | Foreground responsibility; actual batch or continuous unit-period | per 1 kg reference flow |
| `nursery` | Settled juvenile nursing | conditional | Actual nursery phase is owned before growout | Foreground responsibility; actual batch or continuous unit-period | per 1 kg reference flow |
| `growout` | Bottom-dwelling flatfish growout | required | Actual selected production | Foreground responsibility; actual batch or continuous unit-period | per 1 kg reference flow |
| `harvest` | Independent flatfish harvest | required | Actual selected production | Foreground responsibility; actual batch or continuous unit-period | per 1 kg reference flow |
| `live_gate` | Bounded live holding and packing before final gate acceptance | conditional | Dispatch records establish live whole-food-fish handover and whole_chill is inactive | Foreground responsibility; actual batch or continuous unit-period | per 1 kg reference flow |
| `whole_chill` | Bounded pre-killing holding and whole-fish fresh/chilled preparation before final gate acceptance | conditional | Actual killing or fresh/chilled whole-fish dispatch occurs; live_gate node inactive for this lot | Foreground responsibility; actual batch or continuous unit-period | per 1 kg reference flow |
| `treatment` | Owned effluent and solids treatment | conditional | Actual onsite treatment receives source-stage discharges | Foreground responsibility; actual batch or continuous unit-period | per 1 kg reference flow |
| `declared_gate_release` | Final actual-state acceptance and producer handover | required | Every qualifying delivered lot; receive exactly one evidenced state branch | Sole final gate, reference quantity and acceptance rejects; no invented duplicate packing or chilling activity | 1 kg final accepted net fish |

Each process below is indexed by actual cohort, unit, batch/campaign or continuous reporting period. Its resource/emission cards are conditional on actual use/release within an included process; they do not prescribe universal materials. Shared meters and onsite utility/treatment transfers are attributed once, with every source-stage demand retained in the ledger. No optional zero stands for missing evidence. Auxiliary asset/provider-service records retain actual provider units, service period, activity and consumer allocation; unresolved services are not represented by fictional kg exchanges.

### Process: Broodstock, incubation and larval flatfish production (`hatchery`)

Managed production parent: hatchery. Select actual natural, induced or artificial reproduction; no universal hormone practice. Trace broodstock acquisition, maintenance, replacement and retirement across spawning cycles, incubation, yolk reserves, first feeding, metamorphosis, bottom settlement and weaning; purchased eggs/larvae replace only prior owned phases and retain upstream burdens. Record egg and larval counts separately from measured wet fish biomass. Transfer living settled juveniles to nursery or growout. Actual phase resources and discharges below include cleaning, health events, temperature/light control and start-up.

### Process: Owned larval live-food cultivation (`livefood`)

Separate live-food batches supply hatchery only when cultivated in-house. Include starter cultures or cysts, nutrients, enrichment media, actual source water, light/heat/aeration energy, chemicals, culture failures, harvesting losses, spent media and releases. Purchased live food is instead an upstream hatchery input; never count both purchased production and owned production for the same batch. Live-food wet biomass excludes culture water; counts/cell densities remain auxiliary unless representative mass measurement supports conversion.

### Process: Bottom-dwelling flatfish growout (`growout`)

Managed production parent: growout. Feed and manage the identified food-flatfish cohort until actual harvest-ready state. Measure usable bottom area and time occupancy without assuming all fish occupy water volume like round fish. Technology delta attaches to hatchery/nursery/growout as applicable: actual flow-through pumped water, evidenced flat-bottom cage, or site-demonstrated RAS changes abstraction, electricity, filtration, biofilter, disinfection, sludge/backwash and release requirements. Different units may coexist, but one unit-period has one resolved topology; circulated water is an internal activity, not repeated abstraction.

### Process: Independent flatfish harvest (`harvest`)

Remove fish from their actual tank, raceway or cage, or recover whole fish already independently evidenced as suitable fresh food, into state-separated measured harvest lots. This node owns removal/recovery, crowding, nets/pumps and sorting losses independently of growth and subsequent killing/preservation. Trace live fish, qualifying fresh fish, rejects, escapes and nonqualifying mortalities by source cohort/event; the same fish cannot be both product and mortality waste. Live whole fish enter selected live_gate or whole_chill; qualifying fresh whole fish enter only whole_chill, and unknown food suitability is not product. Internal inputs/outputs retain measured quantities and prior burdens. Farm harvest does not imply wild capture origin.

### Process: Bounded live holding, packing and producer handover (`live_gate`)

Preserve living whole harvested fish through actual bounded recovery/holding, oxygen/water/thermal control and actual packing/loading at the first producer gate. Record holding duration, fitness, transport water, oxygen, package reuse/washing and loss before the gate. No further managed growout is hidden here. Loaded live product excludes water, oxygen and packaging from net biomass. Post-gate distribution is outside.

### Process: Whole-fish fresh or chilled preservation and handover (`whole_chill`)

Receive live whole harvested fish for actual killing and fresh/chilled handling, or naturally dead fresh whole fish only with prior independent food-suitability evidence; natural death alone never establishes food safety. This node owns all actual bounded pre-killing holding for a fresh/chilled lot: record start/end, viability, maintenance feed, water, oxygen, heat/electricity and losses. Do not activate live_gate or use its final card as internal input; do not hide managed growout. Preserve unheaded ungutted form and record killing/death and handling times, temperatures, ice, washing, cooling, leakage, rejects and effluent. No gutting, heading, filleting or freezing is included. Actual farm ice is separate and cannot reuse capture-vessel ice identity. Packing/loading stops at first producer handover; fish mass excludes ice/water/package.

### Process: Owned effluent and solids treatment (`treatment`)

Receive source-stage wastewater, backwash, spent cultures and solids by unique transfer/event id, process using actual separation/treatment equipment, and record final waste handoff and environmental outfalls once. Identify hatchery/livefood/nursery/growout/harvest/live_gate/whole_chill contributors, treatment period and consuming unit. Direct source-stage discharge is reported at that source instead; an internal treatment transfer must not also be reported as a direct environmental emission. Reused water remains internal; verify final nitrogen/phosphorus and actual health substance species.

## 7. Allocation and Co-product Handling

| rule_id | Applies to | Rule | source_ids |
| --- | --- | --- | --- |
| `allocation_precedence` | common burdens | Subdivide independently measured stages first. For remaining shared burdens use evidenced causal activity: pump/thermal/oxygen demand, measured treatment load, or bottom-area-time where it represents actual occupation. Document driver and denominator; wet fish mass alone is not assumed causal. | `ghg-product-allocation-2011`; `flatfish-foreground-method` |
| `allocation_outputs` | intended products | Enumerate all intended sale outputs at their actual handoffs, including food-size grades, independently sold seed/eggs or qualifying retired broodstock if present. Internal transfers are not extra products. Retain mortality/waste burdens with production; no automatic avoided-burden credits. | `ghg-product-allocation-2011`; `flatfish-foreground-method` |
| `allocation_fallback` | remaining common burdens | If a causal physical relationship cannot be established, justify common-gate economic shares using actual matched-period prices and quantities; disclose sensitivity to plausible alternatives. Use the same method for comparable outputs and no unexplained mixing. | `ghg-product-allocation-2011`; `flatfish-foreground-method` |
| `allocation_period` | cohorts; assets; broodstock | Index actual batch/continuous unit-periods, cleaning/changeover, opening/closing live stocks and transfer burdens. Carry unfinished-cohort burdens forward once; share broodstock maintenance over evidenced spawning outputs/cycles, not an invented lifetime. Record replacement, retirement and terminal fates. | `ghg-product-allocation-2011`; `flatfish-foreground-method` |
| `allocation_assets` | shared assets and contracted services | Enumerate all consuming nodes and periods for pumps, tanks, cages, cold rooms, transport/loading or contracted services. Deduplicate common meter/invoice/event ids.

### Calculation Rules

| rule_id | Applies to | formula_or_rule | inputs | output | source_ids |
| --- | --- | --- | --- | --- | --- |
| `normalize_lot` | all inventory rows | Sum actual attributable stage quantities over matched cohort/period; divide each by delivered qualifying net wet fish mass in kg to report per 1 kg reference flow. Count only the actually selected final state; retain actual internal transfer yields. | primary quantity; allocation share; actual net delivered fish mass; cp_harvest; cp_live_gate; cp_whole_chill; cp_gate_release | normalized exchange in original compatible property/unit | `flatfish-foreground-method` |
| `count_mass` | fish and live-food transfers | Use actual cohort count times representative measured individual wet biomass only when sampling is defensible; retain water/tare exclusion, stratification and uncertainty. Egg/cell counts have no universal fish-mass equivalence. | actual count; measured sample weight; sample count; tare; stage | actual stage-qualified wet biomass | `flatfish-foreground-method` |
| `outfall_load` | direct substance release | Calculate gross outlet load G_s by integrating actual outlet flow times duration times concentration for each identified substance s, with explicit elemental/species and unit conversions. The final direct-release inventory uses site-attributable load E_s = G_s minus B_pass_s, where B_pass_s is the independently evidenced incoming background amount of that same substance that actually passes through to that same receiving medium in the matched accounting interval. Establish B_pass_s from paired inlet/outlet records and an explicit source/fate balance including opening/closing water and substance stocks, residence-time lags, internal transfers, treatment, retained growth, removed solids and other actual destinations. Use each stream's own measured flow; do not assume equal inlet/outlet volume, subtract the whole inlet load by default, or deduct recirculation again. Gross G_s is retained as a diagnostic, not added again as a second inventory emission. If B_pass_s or its exclusion as inapplicable cannot be evidenced, retain the gross observation and the unresolved attribution gap; do not silently choose gross/net or finalize the affected E_s. Negative or uncertain differences require review, not clipping or removal credit. Apply normalize_lot to the supported original E_s once. Feed-input balance estimates are an alternative evidence route only with composition, retained growth and all removal fates reconciled to this same site-attributable boundary; never equate feed nutrient input to direct emission or add both estimates. | actual stream-specific flow; duration; matched inlet/outlet substance concentrations and units; source/fate and opening/closing stock records; lab QA; background pass-through evidence | kg site-attributable substance to identified medium before normalize_lot | `flatfish-foreground-method` |
| `combustion_leak` | fuel emissions and fugitive releases | Use actual fuel quantity with independently supported fuel composition/emission factor, or direct measurement; distinguish fossil/biogenic carbon. For refrigerants reconcile opening charge, refill, recovered and closing charge by actual substance and event; no default factor is prescribed. | actual fuel/charge; verified factor or monitoring; event and equipment records | kg actual substance by source stage and receiving air | `flatfish-foreground-method` |

### Data Quality Requirements

| --- | --- | --- | --- |
| `quality_identity` | reference and routes | Independently identify actual species, aquaculture/food purpose, whole state, gate and each owned/purchased phase; evidence current topology without importing a turbot recipe. | taxon record; supplier/site/dispatch evidence |
| `quality_closure` | cohort and environment | Reconcile all stock phases and transfer ids, growth, feed moisture, mortality/escape/rejects; preserve all stage fates and outfall lab QA; disclose residual balances and detection limits. | primary ledger, calibration and lab QA |
| `quality_outfall_basis` | direct substance release at every actual stage/outfall under its own collection protocol | Retain gross outlet G_s, evidenced incoming background B_pass_s and resulting site-attributable E_s separately in kg of each actual substance before final reference normalization. Link sample, stream, node, receiver, event/interval and residence-time alignment; document each flow/duration/concentration conversion, background source and its actual pass-through versus treatment/retention/other fate, opening/closing stocks, uncertainty and any unresolved evidence. Recirculation and internal wastewater transfers are not new environmental inputs or final discharges. Do not net different substances, media or unmatched periods, assume the entire inlet load passes through without source/fate evidence, or count provider treatment/direct releases twice. A supported zero background contribution requires evidence, not absent inlet records. | Paired stream measurements and laboratory reports; source/fate and stock balance; background-attribution calculation and uncertainty |
| `quality_coverage` | all quantities | No omitted owned phase, resource, emission or supplier burden may be replaced by silent zero. State measured, calculated or estimated coverage and uncertainty; provisional QA ranges never supply missing observations. | coverage and uncertainty register; flatfish-foreground-method |

No actual exchange may be omitted. | per-flow original records under the linked protocol, identity and destination evidence |
| `dq_atomic_card_identity` | all inventory rows | Each card represents one physically identified exchange, not a collection or selector. Keep Electricity as one electrical-energy flow; supplier, geography and voltage remain actual collected qualifiers, not grounds for speculative splitting. Other actual materials, waste streams, carbon origins and receiving media must have separate identities and atomic cards before completion. Preserve every existing collection obligation; an absent card or unresolved identity never means zero or a waived exchange. Paired internal water transfers retain the same actual quality, transfer id, quantity and upstream burden, without another purchase. | Per-card identity, provider, state, destination and paired records |
| `dq_atomic_range_evidence` | repaired atomic flow cards | U_row is an unresolved evidence requirement, not a numerical estimate, default, clipping limit or completeness pass. Establish each card's own matching-unit/reference-basis upper envelope from independent representative records or a compatible documented supplier/design bound, retaining scope, method and uncertainty. Do not reuse a removed aggregate range, copy a sibling quantity, derive a bound from the target batch itself or invent a value. Applicable missing evidence blocks quantitative QA completion; actual measurements remain required. | Independent envelope evidence; retained raw records and uncertainty |

## 9. Validation Rules

| rule_id | Applies to | Rule | source_ids |
| --- | --- | --- | --- |
| `validate_scope` | reference lot | Verify actual species with independent taxon evidence, aquaculture origin, human-food use, whole unheaded ungutted form and first producer gate. Neither a CPC label nor turbot example proves these facts. | `flatfish-foreground-method` |
| `validate_branch` | live_gate_final; whole_chill_final; flatfish_gate_release | Verify exactly one evidenced live or fresh/chilled preparation branch supplies the final gate; independently measured branch transfer and acceptance losses reconcile to the sole 1 kg final reference output. Never fix a branch transfer to 1 kg or combine states. Unknown state or food suitability fails completeness. | `flatfish-foreground-method` |
| `validate_phases` | hatchery; livefood; nursery; growout | Owned larval records must evidence first feeding, metamorphosis, settlement and feed transition; purchased stage must identify upstream coverage. Check phase-specific feed wet/dry basis, count/representative weight, bottom-contact area/occupancy and survival without universal stocking/FCR/temperature values. | `flatfish-foreground-method` |
| `validate_topology` | water; energy; treatment | Require actual unit-period water diagram, sources and meters; RAS requires actual circulation, filtration/biofilter, solids/backwash and treatment evidence. Confirm abstraction/supply/recirculation distinction, current energy provider and treatment ownership. | `flatfish-foreground-method` |
| `validate_closure` | all processes | Reconcile phase counts/wet biomass, transfers, growth, mortality, escapes, rejects and final handoff with uncertainty. Check growout_fish → harvest_ready_fish → harvest_collected_fish → selected state intake by event: fresh whole fish require independent suitability evidence and only whole_chill; live_gate receives live fish only; product and mortality waste are exclusive. whole_chill alone owns fresh/chilled-lot pre-killing holding resources/losses, including actual maintenance feed and escape fates. Link all actual stage resources, cleaning/health events, direct releases and waste transfers to unique source unit/cohort/period and final fate; check feed nutrient/material and treatment balances with substance, concentration, background, flow, duration and lab QA. | `flatfish-foreground-method` |
| `validate_detection` | direct release and concentration records | Retain raw results, detection/quantification limits, sampling background and analytical uncertainty. Non-detect is not an automatic zero: disclose a justified bounded estimate or gap. A negative inlet-adjusted concentration/load triggers sampling/background review; preserve raw data, do not clip to zero or claim environmental removal without independently supported physical uptake and boundary evidence. | `flatfish-foreground-method` |
| `validate_outfall_basis` | direct waterborne-substance inventory and diagnostic balances | Check outfall_load and quality_outfall_basis: the inventory has one supported E_s on the declared site-attributable basis; G_s remains a separate diagnostic and B_pass_s represents only evidenced incoming background actually reaching the same receiver. Check independent stream flows, substance/element conversion, interval/residence alignment, stocks and all treatment/removal destinations. Missing applicable background/fate evidence blocks the affected exchange; no arbitrary gross/net choice, unsupported full-inlet subtraction, recirculation subtraction, duplicate estimate, clipping or unsupported negative credit is permitted. | `flatfish-foreground-method` |
| `validate_attribution` | common resources; periods; products | Check complete output and consumer lists, phase/run/period boundaries, carryover and replacement/terminal events, drivers and denominator totals, shared invoices/meters and no duplicate internal flows or upstream burdens. | `flatfish-foreground-method` |
| `validate_ranges` | all cards | Use foreground measurements first. All provisional reasoned_estimate ranges are replaceable QA screens, not design/operation limits or substitute values; review outliers and expand with evidence, never clip. Zero requires documented non-use, not missing records. | `flatfish-foreground-method` |
| `validate_identity` | all exchanges | Resolve each actual concrete product/waste/elementary exchange and compatible property/unit before final TIDAS use. Conditional collection obligations in Section 8 require actual distinct substances/materials and destinations. Fixed identity evidence does not prove quantity, emission factor or publication readiness. | `flatfish-foreground-method` |
| `validate_inventory_completion` | all concrete exchanges and section 8 completion obligations | Verify each applicable dq_complete obligation has separately measured and identity-verified exchange cards. Check each quantity, native unit, range evidence, normalization, receiving medium, destination and non-duplication. Any unfulfilled actual child exchange, quantity, identity or destination makes the final dataset incomplete and fails validation; unknown cannot be zero. Static PCR checking does not replace this evidence. |  |
| `validate_final_gate` | declared_gate_release | Exactly one evidenced actual-state branch feeds the final gate; reference definition, actual fish state and release record agree. Use final accepted net mass at this gate as the sole denominator throughout; reconcile receipt, acceptance rejects, losses and output without fixing internal transfers to 1 kg. Own operating resources once at the actual responsible node. Unknown state, denominator or fate makes the dataset incomplete and fails validation. | `flatfish-foreground-method` |
