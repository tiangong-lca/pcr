# Wild live whole hand-tonged Eastern oysters

## 1. Scope and Applicability

Construct foreground data for naturally recruited Eastern oysters (Crassostrea virginica) captured with hand-operated shaft tongs in Maryland Chesapeake Bay and accepted live, whole in their native shells by the harvester's first physical recipient. Capture is removal of an existing natural stock, independent of managed biological production and of subsequent cleaning. Maryland records establish an actual hand-tong fishery, not a universal natural origin: public bars may receive planted juvenile oysters and substrate. Require positive site/cohort provenance and enhancement-history evidence before selecting this narrower scope. Unknown provenance is a selection gap. Deliberately seeded, relaid or enhanced cohorts require separate review; historical shared habitat interventions must be disclosed and attributable burdens reviewed.

Exclude farming, hatchery and nursery routes, patent or hydraulic tongs, dredges and diving; other species and origins; dead, frozen, opened, shucked or cooked reference products. Pre-gate real holding/cooling may begin immediately after capture and overlap other work. No mandatory depuration, temperature, storage duration, bushel conversion, ecosystem-service credit or safety certification is established here. Official sources support qualitative route facts only; foreground protocols establish quantities and selected boundary implementation.

## 3. Reference Flow

| Field | Value |
| --- | --- |
| What | Accepted live whole naturally recruited Eastern oysters in native shells at first harvester physical recipient acceptance |
| How much | 1 kg accepted net whole live mass |
| How well | Same species, provenance, hand-tong route and acceptance specification; native shell and internal contents included; no loose foreign material, free seawater or packaging/tare |
| How long or cycle | Declared complete harvest trips and reporting season/period, including failed trips; disclose asset acquisition, use, maintenance, replacement and retirement periods |
| reference_flow_link | `oysters_accepted` |

| Field | Value |

| Reference amount | 1 |
| Reference product flow | Live whole naturally recruited Eastern oysters at first harvester physical recipient acceptance |
| Reference flow property | Mass `93a60a56-a3c8-11da-a746-0800200b9a66` |
| Reference unit group | Units of mass `93a60a57-a4c8-11da-a746-0800200c9a66` |
| Reference unit | kg |
| Required qualifiers | Crassostrea virginica; Maryland Chesapeake Bay site and cohort origin; natural recruitment evidence; enhancement history; hand shaft tongs; harvest dates/trip/lot; live whole native shell; acceptance location/time/recipient; drainage/tare and calibrated net-mass method; actual cleaning/holding/presentation; reporting and asset periods |

Required qualifiers belong in the foreground package. Native shells are reference product constituents, not a shell coproduct. Declare the legal/title and invoice points separately when they differ from physical acceptance.

## 4. Measurement and Unit Rules

| rule_id | Applies to | Required property | Required unit | Rule |
| --- | --- | --- | --- | --- |
| `reference_mass` | reference product | Mass `93a60a56-a3c8-11da-a746-0800200b9a66` | kg | Weigh accepted live whole oysters with calibrated scales and a declared reproducible drainage/tare procedure under cp_accept; exclude free seawater, loose sediment/foreign material and packaging while retaining native shells and internal contents. |
| `volume_count_conversion` | harvest and acceptance records | Mass | kg | Bushels, bags and animal counts require paired representative lot-specific calibrated net-mass measurements and uncertainty; no universal kg/bushel or flesh-yield conversion. |
| `native_units` | all inventory rows | Actual exchange property | Actual exchange unit | Preserve mass, energy and each service's genuine measured unit; litres require measured density when converting to kg; electricity records may be converted by 1 kWh = 3.6 MJ. Never treat service hours as kg. |

## 5. System Boundary

### Boundary Abstraction

| Field | Value |
| --- | --- |
| declared_starting_condition | Positively evidenced naturally recruited oysters in the declared Maryland Chesapeake Bay habitat before hand-tong removal; disclose historical site interventions |
| starting_condition_role | Natural stock starting condition, not purchased grow-out stock or zero-impact assertion |
| product_classification_scope | Wild oyster category with the narrower species, natural-origin, geography, gear and live acceptance constraints above |
| recursive_input_rule | Purchased or transferred oysters are separately identified upstream inputs with traceable origin and burden; do not loop the same lot through this PCR or relabel relaid/seeded cohorts as natural stock |
| upstream_dataset_requirement | Match all purchased fuels, materials, assets and services to their actual supply boundary; natural recruitment has no invented hatchery/feed inventory, while attributable habitat interventions require review and inclusion |
| disclosure | Site/cohort provenance, intervention history and attribution, complete trips/periods, actual routes and support, exclusions/data gaps, recipient gate, all intended outputs, shared resources and service coverage |

### Boundary Rules

| rule_id | Applies to | Rule | source_ids |
| --- | --- | --- | --- |
| `scope_provenance` | capture selection | Establish natural cohort origin and site history positively; public fishery designation is insufficient because public bars can be planted. Exclude deliberate seeded/relaid/enhanced cohorts pending separate review. Review attributable historical habitat interventions without silently assigning zero. | maryland-oyster-landings; noaa-eastern-oyster |
| `whole_trip_gate` | all nodes | Include outbound travel, search/tonging, unsuccessful trips, return, landing and necessary pre-gate shore support through first physical recipient acceptance; stop before recipient depuration, opening and processing. Invoice/title alone does not determine the gate. | |
| `conditional_interfaces` | condition, sort, preserve, accept | Record transfer ids and actual event order; no invented serial sequence. Preservation can start at capture and overlap sorting or presentation. Each event/resource has one owner. Cleaning only activates for actual animal cleaning/preparation; equipment-only cleaning leaves animals on bypass and belongs to its operating node. | |
| `support_boundary` | shared vessel, gear and shore support | Record asset/service coverage, consuming nodes and periods. Account for fuels, electricity, water, consumables, maintenance, repair, acquisition and retirement where attributable. Choose inclusive purchased service or its covered direct resources/emissions/capital once; add only demonstrably uncovered parts. | |

## 6. Process Inventory Structure

### Process Map

| process_id | process_name | inclusion | inclusion_condition | role | quantitative_reference |
| --- | --- | --- | --- | --- | --- |
| capture | Hand-tong capture and full vessel trip | required | Selected provenance and hand shaft tong gear proven | Remove natural stock; transfer raw live catch to actual next node; classify returned/incidental material | Per 1 kg reference flow |
| condition | Primary animal cleaning/preparation | conditional | Actual bounded animal washing or loose-material removal occurs | Raw collected shellstock to prepared live shellstock; bypass when absent | Per 1 kg reference flow |
| sort | Grade and destination sorting | required | All lots require live/accepted versus return/reject destination decision | Incoming raw/prepared/held live oysters to intended grade lots and explicit return/reject states | Per 1 kg reference flow |
| preserve | Pre-gate live preservation | conditional | Actual bounded holding, cooling or other live support occurs | Usable live shellstock to still-live supported shellstock; record losses | Per 1 kg reference flow |
| accept | Presentation, pre-gate delivery and recipient acceptance | required | Every reference lot reaches physical acceptance | Present sorted live oysters, separate package tare, reconcile accepted and refused masses | Per 1 kg reference flow |

Natural-stock removal and live returns are mandatory physical catch/ecological-impact records under cp_capture and cp_sort. Whole-animal shell-inclusive mass is not ecological biomass mass. Do not force removal or live returns into an elementary exchange: require an explicit compatible impact method and verified resource/return identity, preserving ecological measures separately from the product mass ledger.

Production is trip/batch based with reporting-season, shared-service and asset-period indexes. A transfer may connect capture, condition, sort, preserve and accept in the actual order; repeated interventions use uniquely indexed instances and never duplicate animals as final outputs. All input and output cards below are calculated per reference basis by period normalization using their own node protocol; record unnormalized physical batch quantities first. Every amount rule below describes raw measurement or attribution before that explicit division by the same period's accepted net reference mass, except the 1 kg reference normalization identity. Conditional collection obligations in Section 8 expand into zero, one or multiple separately identified exchanges with independent quantities, actual flow classification and destinations. Each expanded exchange requires its own U_instance and verified identity; parent U_row is neither a shared aggregate cap nor an inherited bound.

## 7. Allocation and Co-product Handling

| rule_id | Applies to | Rule | source_ids |
| --- | --- | --- | --- |
| `reconcile_before_attribute` | all nodes/trips | Reconcile physical inputs, transfers, water/foreign material, all intended outputs, returns, mortalities, waste and stock changes before allocation. Record every intended grade/species hand-off once. Packaging is ancillary and whole native shells remain oysters; mortality/bycatch is not automatically coproduct. | |
| `specific_attribution` | multiple intended outputs | Prefer direct measured assignment and subdivision by actual effort/resource use. For inseparable shared trips/periods require an explicit reviewed PCR-specific causal attribution decision, evidence and sensitivity; do not impose mass, revenue or substitution by default. Without a defensible decision the multi-output dataset remains incomplete. | |
| `period_shared` | vessel, gear, services and shore assets | Index acquisition, use, repair/replacement and retirement over actual asset/service periods; enumerate consuming nodes/outputs and allocate using recorded usage. Include failed trips within the complete supported period. Reconcile all shares to the asset/service total; never charge full acquisition every season or an inclusive service plus its covered burdens. | |
| `no_automatic_credit` | wild stock and returns | No automatic carbon storage, filtration, habitat-restoration, biodiversity, avoided-treatment or mortality credit. Record actual intervention and impact evidence separately; credits require a separately reviewed method and boundary. | |

## 8. Foreground Data Collection, Calculation, and Quality Rules

### Data Collection Protocols

Protocol aggregation fields state the final reference basis. Each protocol retains raw trip/event quantities first, attributes actual node-owned resources, and divides by the same complete period's accepted net mass from cp_accept. Pair transfers; condition owns actual animal preparation only, sort reconciles every intended grade/destination, preserve owns actual overlapping support once, and accept reconciles refusals, packaging and reusable stock. These responsibilities remain in the raw ledgers and calculation rules rather than changing the reference denominator.

| protocol_id | process_id | flow_role | record_type | raw_fields | collection_method | unit | frequency | temporal_coverage | site_scope | aggregation_rule | quality_evidence |

### Calculation Rules

| rule_id | Applies to | Formula or rule | Inputs | Output | source_ids |
| --- | --- | --- | --- | --- | --- |
| `normalize_period` | all inventory rows | Divide each reconciled node-attributable period exchange by accepted net whole live reference mass of the same complete period; keep native numerator units and disclose attribution before division. | node ledgers; accepted net mass; reviewed attribution | exchange per 1 kg reference flow | |
| `reference_identity` | oysters_accepted | Accepted net reference mass divided by that same accepted net reference mass defines 1 kg; the 1..1 range is normalization identity, not raw yield. Zero accepted output cannot supply a denominator. | cp_accept accepted mass | 1 kg reference output | |
| `balance_transfers` | all internal live transfers | Pair unique transfer dispatch/receipt by lot, time, state and drainage; reconcile discrepancies, stock changes, losses and removed foreign material before normalization. | five node ledgers; transfer ids | reconciled physical network | |
| `conversion_records` | count, bushel, energy and volume records | Derive lot-specific kg from calibrated paired measurements; preserve uncertainty and sampling scope. Convert kWh to MJ with 1 kWh = 3.6 MJ; volume-to-mass requires actual density. | paired calibration records; meters; density | consistent native mass/energy values | |

### Data Quality Requirements

| requirement_id | Applies to | Requirement | Evidence |
| --- | --- | --- | --- |
| `provenance` | scope | Natural recruitment, species, site/cohort, hand shaft tongs and intervention history must be positively evidenced; uncertain origin blocks selection. | Cohort/site records, harvest logs and intervention history |
| `completeness` | all nodes | Cover complete periods/trips and all intended outputs, returns, failures, support and destinations. Missing quantity is a data gap, never measured zero. | Ledger and physical reconciliation |
| `bounds_identities` | all exchanges | Each symbolic U_row and each expanded U_instance needs independent reviewed quantitative evidence before quantitative finalization; confirm actual concrete identity, support property/unit and destination before final exchange construction. | Range evidence and exact identity compatibility records |
| `shared_periods` | support | Document consuming nodes/outputs, relevant periods, lifetimes/replacement and inclusive service coverage; unknown termination or attribution blocks finalization. | Asset/service register and share audit |
| `live_gate` | reference | Prove live state and physical acceptance separately from cooling, dealer invoicing and legal title; retain calibrated whole net mass and uncertainty. | Inspection and acceptance records |
| `collect_capture_fuel` | `capture`; Inputs; Product flows: Vessel fuel | Add a separate inventory exchange for each actual physical or chemical flow; determine its identity, flow type, composition/state, native property/unit, provider or receiving medium/destination.

| `collect_accept_releases` | `accept`; Outputs; Elementary flows: Conditional direct delivery and acceptance releases | Add a separate inventory exchange for each actual physical or chemical flow; determine its identity, flow type, composition/state, native property/unit, provider or receiving medium/destination. Preserve actual unallocated quantities, raw records and normalization under the collection duties below. This requirement is not a collection exchange, an assumed zero, or permission to copy aggregate amounts, ranges or UUIDs onto its components. Actual directly operated pre-gate delivery or shore-support emissions belong to this node, not capture. Expand by pollutant substance and receiving medium; distinguish fossil combustion carbon dioxide from respiration and exclude provider emissions already covered by inclusive services. No fixed UUID is supplied for this conditional collection. Flow property / unit: Actual release property / actual release unit; Amount rule: Actual node-owned fuel/activity and documented substance-specific factor or measured release, attributed and divided by same-period accepted reference mass under cp_accept.; Value mode: Calculated value (`calculated_value`); Specificity: Technology-specific (`technology_specific`); Normalization basis: per 1 kg reference flow; Basis kind: Reference flow (`reference_flow`); Evidence kind: Calculated from collection (`calculated_from_collection`); Collection protocol: `cp_accept` Range-evidence collection duty (not an established interval and never copied onto each concrete exchange): Range: Provisional independent delivery release evidence need Range role: QA guardrail (`qa_guardrail`) Lower: 0 Upper: U_accept_releases Unit: actual instance unit Basis: per 1 kg reference flow; independent U_instance by substance and receiving compartment Basis kind: Reference flow (`reference_flow`) Evidence kind: Reasoned estimate (`reasoned_estimate`) | Raw measured/activity, composition, transfer/destination, supplier scope and independent range evidence; `cp_accept`;  |
| `transport_cargo_scope` | any applicable pre-gate transport, return trip and shared transport service | Collect actual load and distance in the transport service native unit; load includes accompanying water, ice and containers and is not replaced by net reference animal/fish mass. Record actual fuel/service burdens and attribution for loaded, empty-return and zero-output periods. Inclusive transport-service scope excludes duplicate owned fuel, electricity, assets and direct releases; retain return and reusable-container responsibility. | Actual cargo, distance, trip, container and provider-scope records |

## 9. Validation Rules

| rule_id | Applies to | Rule | source_ids |
| --- | --- | --- | --- |
| `validate_scope` | scope/reference | Reject incompatible species, origins, gear, seeded/relaid/enhanced or uncertain cohorts and nonlive/processed reference products. Require every qualifier and intervention disclosure. | maryland-oyster-landings; noaa-eastern-oyster |
| `validate_network` | all nodes | Require actual conditional activations/bypasses, real hand-offs, node-owned protocols and one owner per overlapping event. Reconcile full trips, transfers, material/water/tare and all output states before attribution; internal quantities are not fixed to 1 kg. | |
| `validate_attribution` | outputs/assets/services | Require complete intended-output and period sets, reviewed causal attribution when inseparable, reconciled shares and no duplicate inclusive service/direct burden or repeated asset acquisition. Unresolved attribution, replacement/retirement or missing output destination is incomplete. | |
| `validate_mass_identity` | oysters_accepted | Require one final accepted live net whole reference output, paired calibrated volume/count conversions where used and a positive accepted-mass denominator; 1..1 is only the normalization identity. | |
| `validate_evidence` | all exchange instances | Do not finalize without exact UUID/support verification and independently evidenced quantitative bounds. Review actual substance/compartment and service units; no guessed identity, universal yield, kg/bushel, time-temperature rule or automatic environmental credit. | |
| `validate_atomic_completion` | all applicable collection requirements and concrete inventory exchanges | Resolve every applicable section-8 collection requirement into individual physical/chemical exchanges with their own quantities, native units, composition/state, range basis or explicit uncertainty evidence, raw records, normalization, actual destinations/receiving media and verified compatible UUIDs. Any unresolved applicable requirement makes the final dataset incomplete and validation fails; unknown is not zero. Never copy aggregate amounts onto components or duplicate inclusive services with owned fuel/electricity/direct releases. Internal transfers are not fixed to the final 1 kg. | |
