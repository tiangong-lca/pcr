# Wild Salmonidae, live, fresh or chilled

## 1. Scope and Applicability

This PCR produces foreground data for whole, unheaded and ungutted human-food Salmonidae captured from wild stocks and delivered at first landing or collector handover. Actual marine, brackish or freshwater capture is covered; family identity and wild-capture origin require records independently of market names. Each lot declares exactly one actual live, fresh or chilled state. Habitat, state, species and geography are not inferred from platform availability.

Aquaculture grow-out, ornamental or non-food fish, eggs or juvenile seed as the delivered product, frozen or thawed fish, gutted/head-removed fish, fillets and separately processed roe/liver are excluded. Downstream wholesaling, independent processor handling and distribution after the declared first handover are outside this scope. Hatchery-supported wild catch requires evidence of stock origin and attributable upstream enhancement; it is neither automatically farmed nor burden-free. Capture is a distinct removal responsibility; natural growth before capture is not invented foreground cultivation.

## 5. System Boundary

### Boundary Abstraction

| Field | Value |
| --- | --- |
| declared_starting_condition | Actual wild stock at capture location, gear engagement and trip/shore effort; documented upstream attributable support and supplied inputs |
| starting_condition_role | Biological capture context, not a purchased 1 kg fish input or invented cultivation process |
| product_classification_scope | Whole food Salmonidae wild capture at first landing; classification does not imply all marine habitats |
| recursive_input_rule | Same-category purchased fish is separately declared with its true provider gate and upstream dataset; internal catch transfers do not recurse as fresh purchases |
| upstream_dataset_requirement | Actual fuels, water, energy, gear/asset materials, packaging and attributable hatchery-release support require compatible provider datasets and quality/gap disclosure |
| disclosure | Species, stock origin, catch habitat, trip/season/effort, gate/state, support attribution, period/asset service and omitted/unresolved contributions |

### Boundary Rules

| rule_id | Applies to | Rule | source_ids |
| --- | --- | --- | --- |
| boundary_capture | capture | Include actual trip mobilization, outbound/return travel, gear deployment/retrieval, retention and first-capture handling; record habitat and effort independently from taxonomy. Natural growth is not foreground farming. | noaa-salmon-fishery-planning |
| boundary_preserve | preserve | Include actual pre-gate live holding or chilling only when performed; record usable state before intervention and stabilized state/time at transfer. Exclude freezing, gutting and filleting. | fao-capture-ice-handling; fao-live-fish-handling |
| boundary_landing | landing | Include first-landing acceptance, protective packaging and producer-owned handling before handover; identify package material/reuse and final state. Later distribution is outside this node. | fao-capture-ice-handling |
| boundary_support | stock_enhancement | Determine release-stock contribution from actual origin evidence and quantify attributable upstream provider burden with documented periods; unknown contribution is a disclosed gap, not zero or invented cultivation. | noaa-pacific-salmon-support |
| boundary_period_assets | all processes | Link trip, holding, landing, seasonal reporting and asset service/replacement/retirement periods; enumerate shared vessel, hold, pumps, landing platform and every consuming node. Include attributable material and service burdens once. | |
| boundary_ecosystem | catch records | Record removed target/non-target biomass, live releases, discard survival/mortality and gear loss with locations and uncertainty. Establish actual destination and material/substance before adding exchanges; do not invent an elementary fish-stock UUID. | noaa-salmon-fishery-planning |
| boundary_full_inventory | all processes | Inventory actual ancillary fuels, energy, water abstraction, treatment agents, wastewater and direct species-specific releases wherever used, including pre-gate cleaning/changeover; collection obligations in Section 8 require actual concrete exchanges rather than generic default identities. | |

## 6. Process Inventory Structure

The production mode is a trip/shore batch with a defined seasonal reporting period. Index every input, catch output, cleaning/changeover and holding event to its batch and period. Capture produces the retained initial fish independently of preservation. Preservation accepts usable caught fish and hands over the actual maintained live or chilled state. Landing protects/presents that state, verifies acceptance and hands it over; it does not include subsequent distribution.

### Process Map

| process_id | process_name | inclusion | inclusion_condition | role | quantitative_reference |
| --- | --- | --- | --- | --- | --- |
| capture | Wild-stock capture | required | Actual vessel or shore wild capture | Foreground capture; parent for the preservation/landing chain | Measured retained catch and complete catch ledger |
| preserve | Pre-landing live holding or chilling | conditional | Actual pre-first-gate holding/chilling recorded for the lot | Preservation; follows capture | Actual incoming and outgoing whole-fish mass |
| landing | First landing and dispatch | required | Actual first landing or collector handover | Protective packaging and handover; receives actual selected branch | 1 kg accepted final fish |

All cards use the final reference denominator. Ranges other than the 1–1 kg reference definition are deliberately broad provisional reasoned QA screens, not default inventory factors, regulatory limits or universal allowable values. Their nonnegative finite bounds screen data-entry orders of magnitude across short/long trips, shore/vessel effort, wet/dry packaging and holding alternatives. Zero means evidenced absence only. Actual site/lot records and justified excursions take precedence; unusual values require explanation and replacement of provisional screens with reviewed site evidence. Conditional collection obligations in Section 8 instantiate zero, one or multiple independently verified exchanges after actual specification is known.

#### Inputs

##### Product flows

###### Diesel for freshwater fishing vessels (`inland_diesel`)

Only actual freshwater fishing-vessel diesel; fuel specification, trip and freshwater habitat must match. Record burned mass from receipts and tank reconciliation; marine engines and shore equipment use the separate fuel card.

Conditional identity: this flow represents only actual diesel combustion by a freshwater fishing vessel in the capture role, supported by vessel/engine and freshwater trip records. It does not identify marine-vessel, shore pump, road transport, farm or other diesel use; those require independently matched identities and quantities.

## 7. Allocation and Co-product Handling

| rule_id | Applies to | Rule | source_ids |
| --- | --- | --- | --- |
| allocation_output_set | all intended outputs | Enumerate each species/state/purpose and actual handover. Marketed bycatch or non-food output needs intention, destination and receipts; residues, unsold dead catch, live releases and packaging returns are separately classified. Do not create a co-product merely to allocate burden away. | ghg-product-allocation |
| allocation_hierarchy | shared trip outputs | Prefer separately measured trip/gear/holding tasks and subdivision. For indivisible joint capture, document a causal physical attribution if supported; otherwise disclose a justified value-based or other relationship with same-gate period prices and sensitivity. Simple catch mass is not automatically causal for incidental bycatch. | ghg-product-allocation |
| allocation_period | all nodes and periods | Assign successful/unsuccessful trip effort, seasonal cleaning/changeover and replacement/retirement to their actual output/period scope; list release-cohort and asset-service periods and their supported allocation separately. Do not discard unsuccessful effort or count service burdens in multiple periods. | ghg-product-allocation |
| allocation_shared | shared infrastructure | Maintain one asset/service ledger for vessel, hold, pumps and landing platform; enumerate capture/preserve/landing consumers and relevant periods. Allocate by evidenced service/time/causal use and disclose assumptions; material service shares, replacement and cleaning appear once. | ghg-product-allocation |
| allocation_internal | fish transfers | Link captured, preserved and landing transfers to the same lot; transfer exchanges cancel on aggregation. Reconcile retained fish, final accepted mass, purposeful other outputs, pre-gate rejects and live/dead discards; no duplicate capture or final output. | |
| allocation_support | stock_enhancement | Preserve documented provider/release attribution and exclude overlap with supplied-input burdens; uncertain mixed hatchery/wild composition needs uncertainty and sensitivity rather than automatic zero. | noaa-pacific-salmon-support |

### Calculation Rules

| rule_id | Applies to | Formula or rule | Inputs | Output | source_ids |
| --- | --- | --- | --- | --- | --- |
| lot_mass_attribution | all inventory rows | After documented output/period attribution, divide each applicable lot total by accepted net wet whole-fish kg from cp_final; retain actual internal mass and do not treat transfers as new purchases. | Linked lot records; attribution; cp_final | Exchange quantity per 1 kg reference flow | |
| reference_definition | landed_reference | The declared reference is exactly 1 kg accepted net wet whole fish; the 1–1 kg Range is this internal method definition, not an empirical fish-yield factor. | cp_final | 1 kg reference output | |
| electricity_conversion | electricity inputs | Convert recorded kWh to MJ only when needed, using 3.6 MJ per kWh; preserve quantity and unit evidence. | Meter kWh; provider and voltage | kWh or equivalent MJ | |
| catch_reconciliation | fish outputs and internal transfers | Reconcile target retained biomass, accepted final fish, pre-gate losses, intended other output and discards by lot and state; retain live-release survival/mortality uncertainty separately. | cp_catch; cp_preserve; cp_landing; cp_final | Consistent catch/transfer/dispatch ledger | |
| substance_calculation | capture_fossil_co2; capture_nox | Use actual measured emissions or documented fuel-carbon/engine model with substance basis, compartment, factor provenance and uncertainty; no fixed factor is prescribed. | cp_capture; cp_emissions | Direct pollutant mass | |

### Data Quality Requirements

## 9. Validation Rules

| rule_id | Applies to | Rule | source_ids |
| --- | --- | --- | --- |
| validate_reference | landed_reference | Require one accepted 1 kg net wet whole-fish reference, correct actual state and first gate, complete qualifiers, calibrated tare method and compatible property/unit. | |
| validate_route | process map | Require capture and landing; activate preservation only from actual lot records. Landing selects capture transfer or preserved transfer exclusively for each lot; unknown intervention/state is incomplete. | |
| validate_balance | fish and waste outputs | Reconcile real internal quantities, all intended output gates, pre-gate mortality/rejects and discard destination/survival; do not fix internal quantities to 1 kg or count outputs twice. | |
| validate_mode_period | all inventory rows | Check trip/season identifiers, complete effort, cleaning/changeover, release cohorts and asset replacement/retirement periods; attribution is explicit and no shared-run/period burden is duplicated. | ghg-product-allocation |
| validate_shared | infrastructure and outputs | Check complete consumer/output ledger and PCR-specific physical/value attribution evidence with sensitivity where needed; no automatic mass allocation or zero support burden. | ghg-product-allocation |
| validate_water_energy | utilities and emissions | Reconcile input/return/consumption/wastewater ledgers and actual electricity/fuel specification; retain pollutant substance and medium. Avoid duplicate purchased/self-generated energy or treatment/direct-emission burdens. | |
| validate_identities | all cards | Resolve each actual final exchange to an independently verified concrete identity and support property/unit; unresolved generic cards remain data gaps. A structural check pass does not establish identity or active/publication readiness. | |
| validate_sources_ranges | all amounts | Keep each measurement protocol and finite Range with correct denominator/evidence; final 1–1 kg is method definition. Other provisional screens cannot supply missing observations, fixed factors or regulatory limits. | |
| `validate_inventory_completion` | all concrete exchanges and section 8 completion obligations | Verify each applicable dq_complete obligation has separately measured and identity-verified exchange cards. Check each quantity, native unit, range evidence, normalization, receiving medium, destination and non-duplication. Any unfulfilled actual child exchange, quantity, identity or destination makes the final dataset incomplete and fails validation; unknown cannot be zero. Static PCR checking does not replace this evidence. |  |

## 10. Published Dataset Profile

| Field | Value |

| excluded_use | Aquaculture; ornamental/seed; gutted/fillet/frozen fish; downstream processing/distribution; universal cross-state or cross-fishery equivalence |
| required_metadata | Reference identity/support; species/origin/stock; habitat/geography/gear; first gate/state; trip/season; preservation; provider/asset/release periods; output set and attribution |
| required_quality_disclosure | Record/measurement coverage; unresolved identities or factors; stock-enhancement contribution; discard/gear uncertainty; provisional ranges; allocation sensitivity; excluded burdens |
| update_trigger | Gate/state/species/stock or enhancement change; gear/provider/voltage/material change; season/period change; new emissions or evidence; revised site records or methodology |
