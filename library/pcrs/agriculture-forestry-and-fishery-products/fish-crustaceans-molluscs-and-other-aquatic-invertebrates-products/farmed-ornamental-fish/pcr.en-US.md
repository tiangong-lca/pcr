# Farmed ornamental fish

## 1. Scope and Applicability

This PCR covers live finfish produced by managed breeding, nursery rearing or grow-out for ornamental sale, in freshwater, brackish or marine culture, through actual farm dispatch. It excludes wild fish merely held or acclimated, food fish, bait or stocking seed sold for another purpose, ornamental non-fish animals, aquatic plants and preserved specimens. Purchased juveniles do not remove upstream production burdens. A farm may breed its own stock, buy juveniles, or combine these evidenced sources without mixing wild-held fish into farmed output.

An illustrative route is pond-grown freshwater livebearers. Species and buyer acceptance determine harvest, handling and grades; this example supplies no universal husbandry schedule, mortality, feed conversion or treatment dose. A mass inventory supports environmental accounting, not equivalence of aquarium service between species or grades.

## 2. Product Category Identity

| covered_products | Live freshwater and other finfish from aquaculture intended for ornamental sale at farm dispatch |
| excluded_products | Wild-held fish; food, bait and non-ornamental stocking products; aquatic plants and ornamental non-fish; preserved fish |
| representative_product | Pond-reared live freshwater livebearers of a declared species and sales grade |
| production_route | managed_rearing is the biological parent; pond, flow-through tank and RAS implementations are selected from actual cohort and hydraulic records; farm_harvest, live_conditioning and farm_dispatch complete the route |
| market_state | Live, unprocessed, accepted for ornamental sale at the recorded farm dispatch gate |

For the biological alternative-production module, on-farm breeding adds retained breeders, spawning/nursery activity and period attribution inside managed_rearing; purchased juvenile supply instead requires a supplier nursery/breeding dataset and receiving records. These sources may coexist in separately traceable cohorts. For the alternative-technology module, managed_rearing is the parent: pond use requires actual abstraction, drainage, sediment removal and partial/full harvest records; flow-through tanks require actual inlet/outlet throughput and tank cleaning; RAS adds a return-water/biofilter/solids-removal topology with pumping, aeration, possible heating and treatment start-up. Natural pond food versus purchased or on-site live feed must be disclosed. One physical water circuit cannot simultaneously be modelled as once-through and fully recirculating for the same time interval. Hybrid or sequential systems require separate circuit/phase records, not added parallel default burdens. FA099 supports these qualitative distinctions; current layout, meters, maintenance and water-quality records establish the actual delta.

## 4. Measurement and Unit Rules

| rule_id | Applies to | Required property | Required unit | Rule |
| --- | --- | --- | --- | --- |
| `reference_mass` | reference product | Mass `93a60a56-a3c8-11da-a746-0800200b9a66` | kg | Use calibrated, humane tared/drained batch weighing at dispatch, excluding free water and packaging; document method and uncertainty in cp_stock_managed_rearing; cp_stock_farm_harvest; cp_stock_live_conditioning; cp_stock_farm_dispatch. |
| `count_conversion` | seed_stock; broodstock; market_ready_stock; harvest_stock; harvested_live_lot; conditioning_stock; graded_live_stock; conditioning_returns; other_live_sales; packing_stock; farmed_ornamental_dispatch | Mass `93a60a56-a3c8-11da-a746-0800200b9a66` | kg | Retain counts and grades as auxiliary records. Count-to-mass conversion requires a representative measured same-species/stage/grade lot; record sampling, mean net mass and uncertainty. No universal individual fish weight or count-only kg substitution. |
| `energy_conversion` | all electricity rows | Net calorific value `93a60a56-a3c8-11da-a746-0800200c9a66` | kWh | Preserve metered kWh and energy support identity; if a downstream representation uses MJ apply 3.6 MJ per kWh once. Fuel mass requires actual fuel calorific evidence before energy conversion. |
| `material_basis` | rearing_feed; harvest_bait; conditioning_feed; rearing_treatments; conditioning_treatments; packing_additives | Mass `93a60a56-a3c8-11da-a746-0800200b9a66` | kg | Record feed as-received and dry matter separately; medicines/additives as formulated product and active ingredient separately with composition. Do not substitute nutrient/active mass for purchased product mass. |
| `water_basis` | all water rows | Mass `93a60a56-a3c8-11da-a746-0800200b9a66` | kg | Meter or weigh external water by source; volumetric readings require recorded density/temperature and salinity conversion to kg. Internal recirculation and reused pond water are transfer logs, not repeated fresh supply. |
| `stock_basis` | all fish rows | Mass `93a60a56-a3c8-11da-a746-0800200b9a66` | kg | Separate opening/closing fish stock, retained breeders, measured growth, harvest withdrawals, returned juveniles, deaths, escapes and sales by stage. Growth is not purchased fish input; internal transfer amounts are measured and are not fixed to final reference mass. |

## 5. System Boundary

### Boundary Abstraction

| Field | Value |
| --- | --- |
| declared_starting_condition | Recorded purchased broodstock/juveniles or on-farm breeding/nursery, with opening standing stock and its carried production burdens |
| starting_condition_role | Managed biological production starting condition with explicit supplier or prior-period linkage |
| product_classification_scope | Farmed ornamental live finfish through actual farm dispatch |
| recursive_input_rule | Same-category purchased stock remains an input at its actual life stage and supplier gate; link evidenced upstream breeding/nursery production once; retain missing supplier burdens as disclosed gaps |
| upstream_dataset_requirement | Supplier primary activity or compatible upstream datasets for seed/broodstock, feed/live feed, energy, supplied water, actual materials and capital/replacement items; on-site feed production must include its own materials/energy |
| disclosure | Declare farm topology, species/stages, stock origin, reporting and carried periods, harvest events, shared circuits/assets, treatments, output purposes and all unresolved data/identity gaps |

### Boundary Rules

| rule_id | Applies to | Rule | source_ids |
| --- | --- | --- | --- |
| `boundary_managed` | managed_rearing | Include breeding/nursery where on-site, retained broodstock, grow-out, feeding, water supply, pump/aerator/biofilter/heating operation, cleaning, quarantine, actual treatments, mortality and removed solids. Separate source supply from environmental abstraction. | uf-ifas-ras-fa099 |
| `boundary_harvest` | farm_harvest | Harvest removes the measured sale-bound stock from its pond/tank production context. Include actual trap/seine/bait, pump-down, containers and on-farm transport to conditioning, with transport water/oxygen/energy and losses. This responsibility is separate from biological growth and post-harvest stabilization. | uf-ifas-harvest-fa117; uf-ifas-onfarm-transport-fa119 |
| `boundary_conditioning` | live_conditioning | Stabilize the harvested live lot and grade to actual buyer requirements; record accepted, other sold grades, live returns and mortality. Record actual holding feed/water/oxygen/energy and any treatments; no mandatory therapy is inferred from older guidance. | uf-ifas-grading-fa118; uf-ifas-shipping-fa120 |
| `boundary_dispatch` | farm_dispatch | Include actual farm-side preparation/packing and accepted live output handover. Without bags/boxes, record bulk live handover with packaging amounts zero by evidence. Include carrier water and other packing inputs separately; downstream transport, retail/display and aquarium use lie beyond this gate. | uf-ifas-shipping-fa120 |
| `boundary_water` | all nodes | Record external supplied water and natural abstraction once at entry. Log recirculated water, routed internal transfers, evaporation, water sent with fish, treatment outflow and direct discharge to close circuit/period water balances. A wastewater-to-treatment row is a waste exchange; direct environmental release is elementary, with actual receiving compartment and separately monitored substances. | uf-ifas-ras-fa099 |
| `boundary_emissions` | all nodes | Include actual on-site fuel combustion and monitored/reliably modelled substance-specific air emissions with fuel/engine/factor evidence; purchased heat is a supplier service, not duplicate on-site combustion. Direct water releases require real substance/speciation, measured concentrations/flow and receiving medium; total N/P or COD alone does not establish an elementary substance UUID. | |
| `boundary_period_asset` | all nodes | Include or explicitly justify any capital cut-off. Identify ponds/tanks, buildings, pumps, biofilters, nets, graders, vehicles and reusable transport boxes by asset/service period and every consumer. Retain prior-period stock and asset burdens, start-up/cleaning, replacement and termination events, without charging the same item in each node. | |

## 6. Process Inventory Structure

### Process Map

| process_id | process_name | inclusion | inclusion_condition | role | quantitative_reference |
| --- | --- | --- | --- | --- | --- |
| managed_rearing | Managed breeding, nursery and grow-out | required | All farmed lots; on-site breeding and purchased seed selected from origin records | foreground biological production; cohort or continuous circuit/period indexing | Measured sale-bound stock transferred to harvest; retained stock remains in stock ledger |
| farm_harvest | Harvest and on-farm transfer | required | Every marketed lot is removed from its managed production context | foreground harvest and station-internal transport | Measured harvested live lot delivered to conditioning |
| live_conditioning | Live stabilization and embedded grade sorting | required | Record actual intervention or documented immediate handover with zero incremental resource demand | foreground conditioning; actual holding interval | Measured accepted graded live stock; other sales/returns/losses separately recorded |
| farm_dispatch | Farm preparation and dispatch | required | Every final handover; packaging inputs conditional on actual bags/boxes/tanks | foreground delivery at farm gate; distribution excluded | 1 kg final accepted live biomass |

Index every row by cohort, circuit/tank/pond, run or continuous period and event. Link cleaning, changeover, start-up and maintenance to the consumers that require them. Recurring partial harvests do not imply an empty pond or close out year-end standing stock. Detailed material/service cards below are conditional where stated; each actual exchange must be split by concrete identity, supplier or destination before downstream publication. Internal fish and water transfers reconcile across nodes and cancel from the aggregated external inventory.

## 7. Allocation and Co-product Handling

| rule_id | Applies to | Rule | source_ids |
| --- | --- | --- | --- |
| `allocation_precedence` | all nodes | First subdivide traceable species/cohort/grade processes and directly assign identifiable inputs. For remaining shared burdens use a documented causal driver (metered energy, occupied tank-volume-time or recorded service use); where causality cannot be established disclose economic allocation using contemporaneous species/grade sales values and sensitivity. Record chosen method, output set, prices/driver and total-share reconciliation. No universal default fraction or automatic substitution credit. | ghg-product-standard |
| `allocation_outputs` | live_conditioning; farm_dispatch | Enumerate every independently sold species/grade and its actual buyer-purpose/gate. Allocate joint upstream burdens across the complete intended output set before reference normalization. Internal market-ready, harvested and graded stock are transfers, not three credited final products. Deaths/culls/sludge are wastes unless an evidenced independent product review says otherwise; retain their burdens with successful production. | |
| `allocation_stock_period` | managed_rearing; all fish rows | Declare opening/closing nursery/grow-out stocks and breeders, source periods and every partial harvest. Carry accumulated burdens with retained and returned live fish to their next period; disclose recorded growth and stage transitions rather than using a closed-mass assumption for growing biomass. Breeder establishment/replacement burden is apportioned over documented reproductive service periods and offspring, with revision for early termination. No closing-stock sale credit or repeated purchase charge. | |
| `allocation_mode` | all nodes | For batch production link stocking, harvest, cleaning and changeover to cohort. For continuous ponds/circuits link resource meters to bounded periods and harvest events, retaining overlapping age classes and standing stock. Attribute idle/start-up/maintenance and end-of-cycle cleaning with disclosed causal service evidence; reconcile once across all beneficiaries and periods. | |
| `allocation_assets` | all nodes | Maintain a shared asset/service ledger naming pond/tank, building, pump/biofilter, gear, vehicle or reusable box and all consuming nodes/periods. Attribute actual material, replacement, cleaning and operating burdens by documented service use; separate capital material from metered energy. A shared meter total is divided once, never copied at each consumer. Record lifetimes/reuse counts from actual maintenance, replacement and termination evidence, not a universal amortization period. | |
| `allocation_water` | all water rows | Attribute external water and water-system inputs once at source entry; internal reuse/return does not generate another supplier burden. Partition discharged, evaporated, retained, treated and shipped water by recorded destination and period. Treatment inputs and outputs are included once, with actual stage handoffs; no double charge for treatment service plus complete duplicate treatment operation. | |

### Calculation Rules

| rule_id | Applies to | Formula or rule | Inputs | Output | source_ids |
| --- | --- | --- | --- | --- | --- |
| `collected_period_attribution` | all inventory rows | Retain measured run/period totals, assign documented direct/shared output and period shares under section 7, then divide the assigned amount by accepted final net live biomass of that output lot in kg; report each exchange per 1 kg reference flow. Reference output is 1 kg by definition. Internal stocks remain measured transfers, with carried burdens rather than output credits. | cp_stock_managed_rearing; cp_stock_farm_harvest; cp_stock_live_conditioning; cp_stock_farm_dispatch; applicable resource protocol; allocation evidence | Quantity per 1 kg reference flow with raw-total audit trail | reference-definition |
| `stock_reconciliation` | all fish rows | Reconcile opening stock plus external arrivals, actual births/growth and internal returns against harvest/sale, deaths/culls, escapes and closing stock by species/stage. Count and biomass ledgers disclose their differing growth/conversion uncertainty; unexplained imbalance requires review. | cp_stock_managed_rearing; cp_stock_farm_harvest; cp_stock_live_conditioning; cp_stock_farm_dispatch; cp_sales_live_conditioning; cp_sales_farm_dispatch; cp_waste_managed_rearing; cp_waste_farm_harvest; cp_waste_live_conditioning; cp_waste_farm_dispatch | Reconciled cohort/period stock and retained burden ledger | |
| `water_reconciliation` | all water rows | Balance external supply and abstraction against evaporation, storage change, direct release, treatment outflow and water shipped across gate. Internal circuit flows cancel; record actual density and routing, and keep substance loads separate from carrier mass. | cp_water_managed_rearing; cp_water_farm_harvest; cp_water_live_conditioning; cp_water_farm_dispatch; cp_energy_managed_rearing; cp_energy_farm_harvest; cp_energy_live_conditioning; cp_energy_farm_dispatch; cp_emissions_managed_rearing; cp_emissions_farm_harvest; cp_emissions_live_conditioning; cp_emissions_farm_dispatch | Reconciled circuit-period water and substance records | |

| `dq_atomic_card_identity` | all inventory rows | Each card represents one physically identified exchange, not a collection or selector. Keep Electricity as one electrical-energy flow; supplier, geography and voltage remain actual collected qualifiers, not grounds for speculative splitting. Other actual materials, waste streams, carbon origins and receiving media must have separate identities and atomic cards before completion. Preserve every existing collection obligation; an absent card or unresolved identity never means zero or a waived exchange. Paired internal water transfers retain the same actual quality, transfer id, quantity and upstream burden, without another purchase. | Per-card identity, provider, state, destination and paired records |
| `dq_atomic_range_evidence` | repaired atomic flow cards | U_row is an unresolved evidence requirement, not a numerical estimate, default, clipping limit or completeness pass. Establish each card's own matching-unit/reference-basis upper envelope from independent representative records or a compatible documented supplier/design bound, retaining scope, method and uncertainty. Do not reuse a removed aggregate range, copy a sibling quantity, derive a bound from the target batch itself or invent a value. Applicable missing evidence blocks quantitative QA completion; actual measurements remain required. | Independent envelope evidence; retained raw records and uncertainty |

## 9. Validation Rules

| rule_id | Applies to | Rule | source_ids |
| --- | --- | --- | --- |
| `validate_scope` | reference product | Require managed farmed origin, ornamental live finfish purpose, species, grade and actual farm dispatch gate; reject wild-holding, food/non-fish or preserved output substitution. | un-cpc30-ornamental |
| `validate_reference` | farmed_ornamental_dispatch | Exactly one final output row links to the reference; 1 kg is net live biomass and count/grade/health qualifiers are present. No intermediary, breeder or water/package mass substitutes for the reference. | reference-definition |
| `validate_route` | managed_rearing | Require current site/circuit evidence for pond/tank/RAS, seed/breeder origin and biological/technology delta. Reject label-only alternatives, incompatible once-through/recirculating claims for the same circuit/time, or absent heating/treatment/solids evidence when actually used. | uf-ifas-ras-fa099 |
| `validate_transfer` | all fish rows | Match internal transfers and returns with lot/time/stage and measured quantities; cancel their aggregate exchanges. Reconcile stock with observed growth and all harvests, losses, returns and retained breeders. | |
| `validate_inventory` | all nodes | Require actual seed/feed upstream burdens, water/source and circuit records, power/fuel/heat, assets, treatment use and losses. Fuel rows require matching actual combustion substances and evidence; direct discharge requires water medium and monitored actual substance/speciation or an explicit data gap. | |
| `validate_mode_period` | all nodes | Verify cohort/continuous indexing, opening/closing and retained stock, breeding and asset phases, cleaning/changeover, replacement/termination and linked period shares; unresolved attribution blocks final dataset production. | |
| `validate_allocation` | all intended outputs and shared consumers | Enumerate all sold species/grades with actual handovers and method evidence. Confirm direct assignment then disclosed causal/economic residual, stock carrying and shared asset/meter shares; no duplicated burden or presumed co-product credit. | |
| `validate_identity` | all flow cards | Fixed UUIDs must match independently verified actual type, property/unit, stage/gate, geography/provider and destination. Final farm-gate UUID does not identify juveniles, breeders or preharvest stock; CN low-voltage identity cannot cover an unspecified power supply, and ambiguous oxygen is unresolved. | |
| `validate_evidence` | all ranges and treatments | Keep provisional estimates distinct from collected amounts and source evidence; zero conditional exchanges require actual absence records. Require relevant current treatment authorization when actual use calls for it; no historic dose/legal statement is endorsed. | |
| `validate_profile` | downstream dataset | Declare all required qualifiers, uncertainty, cut-offs, upstream/identity/monitoring gaps and matched gate/time. Technical checks alone do not verify a concrete exchange, actual farm balance or publication readiness. | |
| `validate_inventory_completion` | all concrete exchanges and section 8 completion obligations | Verify each applicable dq_complete obligation has separately measured and identity-verified exchange cards. Check each quantity, native unit, range evidence, normalization, receiving medium, destination and non-duplication. Any unfulfilled actual child exchange, quantity, identity or destination makes the final dataset incomplete and fails validation; unknown cannot be zero. Static PCR checking does not replace this evidence. |  |
