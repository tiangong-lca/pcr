# Farmed live whole tidal-pond Japanese sea cucumber

## 1. Scope and Applicability

This PCR governs foreground data production for Apostichopus japonicus raised from received hatchery juveniles in Shandong tidal seawater pond monoculture, collected by boat-supported divers using hands or rakes and net bags, and supplied whole, live, raw and never frozen to the first physical farm-product recipient. Native body contents remain; no evisceration is included. The FAO northern-China chapter supports the species/hatchery/pond context; MARA guidance identifies management questions to investigate; the Qingdao field report independently describes a pond collection and sorting route. None is a measured inventory for every farm.

Exclude wild harvest, open seabed ranching, southern seasonal cage growout, polyculture, ornamental animals, eviscerated animals, extracted tissues, frozen, cooked, dried, smoked, salted or brined products. A processing buyer may receive the whole live product, but that buyer's subsequent conversion is outside the reference. No production, environmental, food-safety, legal, welfare, nutrition, survival or profitability guarantee is made. Actual species, juvenile origin, monoculture, product state and physical receipt require primary lot records.

## 4. Measurement and Unit Rules

| rule_id | Applies to | Required property | Required unit | Rule |
| --- | --- | --- | --- | --- |
| `whole_live_mass` | reference product | Mass `93a60a56-a3c8-11da-a746-0800200b9a66` | kg | Weigh whole live animals on a calibrated scale with documented removal of free carrier water and container tare; keep native body contents. Record live/state observations at receipt and same-lot accepted net mass A in cp_receipt. Whole, gutted, drained-after-evisceration and dry masses are not interchangeable. |
| `native_quantity` | all inventory rows | Actual flow property | actual native unit | Preserve measured kg, m3, kWh, MJ, item counts, animal counts, hours and tonne-km; record supplier-specific density, net mass and load evidence for conversions. Juvenile counts require the same lot's count and sampled mass; do not infer adult yield or use standard survival, feed or water factors. |
| `chemical_basis` | fertilizer, feed, treatment and emission instances | Actual substance basis | kg substance or stated nutrient/carbon basis | Keep product mass separate from nutrient mass, active ingredient and chemical species. Record test or supplier composition and explicit conversion; nitrogen as N is not ammonia mass, phosphorus as P is not phosphate mass, and fossil/biogenic carbon remain separate. |

## 5. System Boundary

### Boundary Abstraction

| Field | Value |
| --- | --- |
| declared_starting_condition | Received living hatchery juveniles with upstream nursery history and supplier burdens; identified pond opening stock, food/sediment/water conditions and asset history |
| starting_condition_role | Foreground entry and period-accounting boundary; excludes no upstream burden merely because entry is juvenile purchase |
| product_classification_scope | Narrow whole-live hatchery-juvenile-origin tidal-pond route within farmed sea cucumbers; no whole-leaf equivalence |
| recursive_input_rule | Juveniles or returned live animals of the same species remain identified inputs/transfers with cohort and period lineage; do not recurse into this adult receipt reference or create a second final output |
| upstream_dataset_requirement | Include compatible hatchery/nursery, delivered supplies, energy, assets and services; document geography, technology, state, coverage and gaps. An upstream complete service and its already included components cannot both be charged. |
| disclosure | Actual nursery location/phases, pond dates and food pathway, managed water exchange, opening/closing stock, returns, mortality, failed batches, pond preparation, infrastructure, all pre-receipt logistics and all intended destinations |

| rule_id | applies_to | rule | source_ids |
| --- | --- | --- | --- |
| `b_route` | foreground_scope | Establish actual hatchery-juvenile-origin tidal pond monoculture and whole live state from primary records. FAO context does not prove a farm's practices; MARA guidance is a candidate management checklist, not evidence that all listed interventions occur or numerical PCR defaults. | fao-northern-mariculture; mara-pond-management-2020 |
| `b_pond` | pond | Include pond preparation, actual onfarm nursery as separately indexed phases, stocking and restocking, managed food production, supplementary feeds actually used, water exchange, actual aeration/pumping/shading/treatment, cleanup and mortality. Pond detritus/diatoms are not automatically manufactured feed inputs or burden-free purchased products; record actual managed fertilizer/feed/substrate inputs and their sediment/water fates. | mara-pond-management-2020 |
| `b_capture` | harvest | Harvest is independent removal from the managed standing stock; growth is not counted again. Record boat/diver hand-rake/net-bag services, collected live animals, incidental sediment/water/organisms, losses and return destinations. Managed pond material accompanies animals as internal T_PI, not a second environmental abstraction; genuinely new external material requires distinct source-boundary evidence. Do not import source productivity or crew-size numbers. | qingdao-pond-harvest-2023 |
| `b_gate` | presentation; receipt | Presentation and logistics have separate nodes. Include every physical movement, actual holding and protective service before the first recipient physically receives the lot, irrespective of owner, payer, invoice or contractual transfer. A recipient's subsequent processing is excluded. | |
| `b_hold` | hold | Activate only with records of a bounded live-preserving intervention, its purpose, place and start/end times; ordinary elapsed time alone does not establish a holding node. Unknown actual state is a data gap, never an inactive default. | |
| `b_handoffs` | internal_transfers | Pair each physical handoff using one transfer id, live state, lot/time, native quantity and one owner: T_PH animals and T_PI managed pond water/sediment to harvest; T_HS collected animals and T_IS incidental material harvest to sort; T_SD sort direct to presentation; T_SH sort to hold; T_HP hold to presentation; T_PR presented lot to receipt. Returns R_HP harvest to pond and R_SP sort to pond pair with pond_returns; any other actual live return is individually registered in that pair. Closing standing stock is a ledger state, not an extra delivered exchange. | |
| `b_environment` | all_nodes | Distinguish delivered water products from elementary seawater abstraction; record tidal and pumped volumes and energy separately. Returned carrier water has its own volume row; each pollutant requires individual substance, nutrient/carbon basis, measured or supported concentration, receiving medium and fate. Do not label the entire water volume as a pollutant or count shipped wastewater as direct release. Actual onfarm treatment has its own service/components and treatment inlet/outlet/removed-solids records; provider treatment is linked to the shipped waste. | |
| `b_assets` | all_nodes | Include actual pond/sluice/substrate, nursery, boat/dive equipment, pumps, holding equipment, containers and logistics asset shares, maintenance, replacement and terminal cleanup. Enumerate consuming nodes and periods; derive service lives/utilization from records with rationale and sensitivity. No universal life, free infrastructure or environmental credit. | |

## 6. Process Inventory Structure

### Process Map

| process_id | process_name | inclusion | inclusion_condition | role | quantitative_reference |
| --- | --- | --- | --- | --- | --- |
| pond | Managed pond production and actual nursery phases | required | Selected route | Biological growth; cohort/pond/phase and seasonal-period ledger | Actual standing-stock handoff to harvest; not fixed at 1 kg |
| harvest | Boat/diver hand-rake net-bag collection | required | Selected route | Independent stock removal; trip/event indexed | Actual collected animal and incidental-material handoffs to sort |
| sort | Whole-live sorting and destination assignment | required | Selected route | Grade/destination separation; event and lot indexed | Actual direct/holding/return/alternate/waste quantities |
| hold | Bounded live-preserving holding | conditional | Observed intervention with start/end and service records before presentation | Live stabilization; bounded lot episode | Actual held live lot handoff; no default duration or shelf-life |
| presentation | Whole-live protective presentation | required | Actual presentation, including measured minimal unpackaged handoff if used | Packaging/container and product interface; event indexed | Presented whole-live lot to logistics |
| receipt | Pre-receipt logistics and first physical receipt | required | All actual movements before receipt, including zero-distance farm handoff | Logistics and recipient acceptance; route/lot indexed | 1 kg accepted net whole-live animals |

Production mode is cohort-batch biological pond production with repeated partial harvest events. Actual nursery and seasonal phases, continuous water/service metering, cleanup and changeover events remain linked to their real cohort, run/event and period; no artificial fixed cycle length is prescribed.

Inventory applicability is determined per actual instance. Every applicable Section 8 collection obligation expands into zero, one or multiple separately identified actual exchanges, each with its own unit, quantity, destination and supporting records. Unknown applicability cannot be assigned zero. Each intended alternate product has a distinct instance/output and receiving gate even if it is a lower-value live grade or a processing destination. The whole-live reference never includes that destination's processing.

All card amounts and ranges use the same actual accepted reference denominator A from cp_receipt after the allocation rules. Internal transfers retain measured quantities and are not forced to 1 kg. A positive denominator and complete cohort/period attribution are required; failed-only periods with no receipt remain in the period ledger pending justified attribution. Each U_row,instance is an unestablished symbolic upper-bound placeholder for that row and instance; this provisional reasoned estimate requires independent foreground observations and uncertainty evidence before a reviewed bound can be supplied; 0..U is not an empirical range, operating limit or invitation to set an active flow to zero. No numeric production default is supplied. Product stock growth is not constrained by a false juvenile-mass equals adult-mass balance.

## 7. Allocation and Co-product Handling

| rule_id | applies_to | rule | source_ids |
| --- | --- | --- | --- |
| `a_subdivision` | all_nodes | First subdivide independently metered cohort, pond, phase, trip, grade, intervention, package and route services. Each physical event has one owner and no duplicate upstream/component burden. Internal T/R transfers carry attributed burdens once, not allocation credit or additional final product. | |
| `a_outputs` | all_intended_outputs | Enumerate every actual intended output and receiver at each node, including alternate whole-live grades, continued-growth returns and beneficial recovered material. Apply subdivision first; for inseparable same-species live grades at one gate, use measured net live mass shares with rationale. For materially different juvenile/other outputs, justify a causal service-use basis; if unavailable, document an economic allocation using same-period actual quantities/prices and sensitivity. Do not extend live-mass allocation automatically to sediment, carrier water, mortality or unrelated materials; no substitution credit. | |
| `a_periods` | pond; all_nodes | Link preparation, upstream and actual onfarm nursery, stocking/restocking, growth, low-activity seasons, repeated harvests, failed batches, open stock and cleanup to cohort/pond/phase/period. Attribute actual shared pond operating burdens by evidenced occupied pond-area-time to cohorts, then intended output attribution; disclose causal limitations and sensitivity to biomass-time if relevant. Preserve closing/opening burden continuity and actual ending/termination events; do not divide all historical burdens by one successful harvest or erase failed periods. | |
| `a_assets` | shared_infrastructure | Maintain one asset/service register identifying pond/sluice/substrate, nursery equipment, boat/dive gear, pumps, work area, holding system, containers and vehicles actually used, all consuming nodes/periods, acquisition/replacement/disposal and service/utilization records. Use metered use first, documented service-hours/trips/area-time as causal alternatives; derive service life from evidence and test uncertainty. Reusable-container washing/repair/replacement belongs to actual uses. Missing life or utilization remains a gap, not an arbitrary standard life. | |
| `a_losses` | mortality; waste; failed_batches | Include mortality, rejected unusable animals, actual treatment and disposal, empty returns and failed services in the supplying cohort or service period. Live returns retain burden/stock lineage rather than receiving waste treatment; only actual recovery or dispatch changes destination. Report unknown mortality/open stock and unsupported attribution as incomplete data. | |

- cp_sort: Reconcile separately animal and incidental quantities; retain transfer measures and attribution; per 1 kg reference flow using A
- cp_hold: Assign episode/asset shares once to actual outputs; retain measured transfers; per 1 kg reference flow using A
- cp_presentation: Separate animal/product from package and carrier water; share reusable services once; per 1 kg reference flow using A
- cp_receipt: Accepted reference output is 1 kg; each attributable native input/output per 1 kg reference flow using accepted net same-lot mass A; no invoice denominator

### Calculation Rules

| rule_id | Applies to | Formula or rule | Inputs | Output | source_ids |
| --- | --- | --- | --- | --- | --- |
| `normalize_receipt` | all inventory rows | Divide each attributable native quantity by accepted same-lot net whole-live mass A in kg after period/output allocation; final same-lot animal output is A / A = 1 kg per 1 kg reference flow. Keep internal quantities measured. | Node-specific protocols; cp_receipt; allocation ledger; A | Native quantity per 1 kg reference flow | |
| `transfer_reconcile` | all physical transfers | Pair each T/R sender and receiver with identical transfer id, lot, state and original measured quantity; separately document any measured time-dependent water/mass change or loss between distinct events instead of forcing equality to final A. | All node protocols; paired records | Transfer and fate reconciliation | |
| `water_load` | actual water pollutant instances | Calculate each substance load from its actual sampled concentration and corresponding measured carrier volume with explicit unit and chemical-basis conversions; disclose background intake, net attribution and retained sediment separately, actual onfarm treatment inlet/outlet and provider treatment coverage. Do not sum carbon/nutrient equivalents as distinct physical substances. | Node water/constituent records; conversion and treatment evidence | Individual substance/medium load and uncertainty | |
| `service_share` | actual shared services/assets | Allocate actual event/period service burden once using evidenced meter or causal use shares and documented service life, replacement and termination; reconcile all consumer shares to the actual total and retain sensitivity. | Node and shared asset registers; allocation ledger | Attributable service burden by node/period/output | |

Each actual direct substance/medium-specific emission or loss fate outside complete-service coverage, with fossil/biogenic carbon distinguished; actual carrier water is separately quantified. <br> - Flow property / unit: Mass `93a60a56-a3c8-11da-a746-0800200b9a66` / kg <br> - Amount rule: Use the actual measured attributable native quantity per 1 kg reference flow from cp_receipt; divide by accepted same-lot A after period/output attribution. <br> - Value mode: Foreground record (`foreground_record`) <br> - Specificity: Site-specific (`site_specific`) <br> - Normalization basis: per 1 kg reference flow <br> - Basis kind: Reference flow (`reference_flow`) <br> - Evidence kind: Collected record (`collected_record`) <br> - Collection protocol: `cp_receipt` <br> - Range: Provisional symbolic evidence gap; U is unestablished and requires independent observations and uncertainty evidence; not a measured QA guardrail, empirical rate or operational limit <br> - Range role: Uncertainty range (`uncertainty_range`) <br> - Lower: 0 <br> - Upper: U_receipt_releases,instance <br> - Unit: kg <br> - Basis: per 1 kg reference flow <br> - Basis kind: Reference flow (`reference_flow`) <br> - Evidence kind: Reasoned estimate (`reasoned_estimate`) | Node collection protocol, original records and individual identity, quantity, range and destination evidence |
| `dq_logistics_water_balance` | logistics, services and water/nutrient balances | Actual payload includes accompanying water, ice, packaging and other cargo. Empty return/repositioning still consumes activity: account for its actual fuel/distance/vehicle service and explicit attribution; zero cargo tonne-kilometres cannot erase that duty. Do not duplicate a complete service and covered fuel, materials, assets or direct releases. Measure external abstraction, supplied water product, internal circulation and actual returned/discharged water separately; never deduct internal recirculation again from external intake. Net nutrient increment/retention is a separate balance diagnostic, never automatically a negative elementary flow, negative emission or avoided burden. | Actual load/vehicle duty records, service scope, same-lot water/substance balance and method evidence |

## 9. Validation Rules

| rule_id | applies_to | rule | source_ids |
| --- | --- | --- | --- |
| `v_eligibility` | reference_product | Fail eligibility when species/origin/route, whole native body, live/raw/never-frozen state or actual first physical receipt is unsupported; eviscerated/dried/frozen and cage/polyculture routes are outside scope. | fao-northern-mariculture |
| `v_mass` | reference_product; all_rows | Check cp_receipt A is positive calibrated accepted net whole-live animal mass; recipient_live_whole is the linked final output at 1 kg. All rows retain native units and per 1 kg reference basis; juveniles, internal transfers and carrier water cannot be set to final A by assumption. | |
| `v_nodes` | process_map | Check all required nodes and actual conditional instances, exact T/R pairs, holding/bypass evidence, animal and incidental fate balances, intended grades/receivers, and no duplicate final output. Unknown holding is incomplete. | qingdao-pond-harvest-2023 |
| `v_food_water` | pond; all_water_rows | Check actual nursery/food/fertilizer/substrate/treatment inputs, tidal/pump/water balances, sediment retention/removal and actual individual chemical/medium releases. No guidance numeric defaults or invented manufactured detritus feed; separate carrier return, shipped wastewater and actual treatment. | mara-pond-management-2020 |
| `v_periods_assets` | all_nodes | Check cohort/phase/run/period completeness, failed services, open stock, replacements/termination, shared asset consumers and service-life evidence/sensitivity; each event and burden is attributed once with no environmental credit. | |
| `v_evidence` | inventory; identities | Every actual card instance needs quantity, own-node protocol, applicable range evidence/remaining gap, property/unit, fate and verified identity before final exchange publication. A candidate structural pass does not resolve UUIDs or prove empirical completeness or publication readiness. | |
| `validate_atomic_completion` | all applicable per-flow collection obligations and final exchanges | Final dataset completion and validation require every actual exchange to have an independent atomic card and its own quantity, property/native unit, collection or calculation evidence, range/uncertainty evidence, normalization, actual destination and verified UUID. Unknown identity, activity state, quantity, range evidence or fate blocks completion; it is never zero, a presumed bypass or permission to omit an obligation. Every important concrete flow retains its own range/uncertainty evidence collection duty; a symbolic upper bound is not an empirical range. | |

## 10. Published Dataset Profile

| Field | Value |
| --- | --- |
| dataset_role | Foreground collection package; after complete review usable as secondary_dataset or background_dataset |
| downstream_use | Downstream LCA process/lifecyclemodel projections for the declared whole-live farm product receipt; recipient conversion model starts after this gate |
| allowed_use | Exact declared species, origin, farm route/state, period and first physical recipient with compatible attribution and upstream coverage |
| excluded_use | Whole CPC leaf equivalence, wild/cage/ranching/polyculture proxies, eviscerated/frozen/dried product, guaranteed sale/quality, environmental benefit claims or unverified final exchange identities |
| required_metadata | PCR/version; species/origin; farm/pond/cohorts/phases/periods; food/water pathways; actual harvest/sort/holding-or-bypass/presentation/logistics; first custody and net mass; all intended outputs/stock/returns; upstream coverage; allocation/assets and service life; units and verified identities |
| required_quality_disclosure | Primary completeness, failed/open stock and uncertainty, sampling/conversion/bounds, source roles, actual treatment/release fate, exclusions and unresolved data/identity/attribution gaps |
| update_trigger | Change of species/origin, nursery/pond/food/water route, collection/preservation/presentation/logistics or recipient gate, state, allocation/service life, supplier data, actual emission/fate evidence or identity verification |
