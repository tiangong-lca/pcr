# Farmed Salmonidae, live, fresh or chilled

## 1. Scope and Applicability

This PCR produces foreground data for aquaculture-origin Salmonidae human-food fish delivered whole, unheaded and ungutted at the first producer harvest or dispatch handover. Declare the actual species, production context and live, fresh or chilled state. Separate head/gut removal, filleting, freezing, ornamental fish, seed-only final outputs and wild capture are outside this reference category. Purchased seed and inputs remain upstream requirements. Post-handover transfer to an independent processor is outside; producer-controlled transfers before the chosen gate are included.

Species identity alone does not select a production recipe. Freshwater trout may complete grow-out in freshwater; a sea phase or smolt stage is required only where actual anadromous production records establish it. FAO descriptions are qualitative technology evidence, not current default feed conversion, density, drug-dose or harvest-size limits.

## 2. Product Category Identity

| Field | Value |
| --- | --- |
| canonical_pcr_id | pcr.agriculture-forestry-and-fishery-products.fish-crustaceans-molluscs-and-other-aquatic-invertebrates-products.farmed-salmonidae-live-fresh-or-chilled |
| classification_refs | CPC 3.0 04222; narrower whole-fish presentation scope |
| covered_products | Whole unheaded/ungutted aquaculture-origin Salmonidae for human food, actual live/fresh/chilled state |
| excluded_products | Wild Salmonidae; non-Salmonidae; ornamental or seed-only final output; head/gut-removed fish; fillets; frozen fish; separately processed meat/liver/roe |
| representative_product | Actual freshwater farmed rainbow trout or actual staged marine farmed Atlantic salmon; neither is a universal recipe |
| production_route | Required parent grow_out; owned seed_rearing or purchased seed stages; actual freshwater flow-through/raceway, RAS or cage technology; evidenced staged marine route and pre_gate_transfer when present; harvest; conditional preservation; dispatch |
| market_state | Declare live, fresh or chilled at the first producer handover; retain separate state-specific lots |

Production route alternative parent: `grow_out`. Owned early-life stages add hatchery feed, health, water, treatment and survival inventories; buying a stage instead adds the provider burden and its transfer. The alternatives are exclusive for the same stage/cohort but may coexist across different traced stages or lots. Technology alternative parent: `grow_out`. Flow-through/raceway requires actual intake/return records; RAS adds recirculation, filtration, sludge and pumping; actual cages require net/mooring/material and receiving-water records. Distinct technologies may coexist at successive documented stages, but the same culture unit and period cannot be assigned conflicting technology flags. Record actual technology, water salinity and stage transitions; source examples do not determine the farm facts.

## 3. Reference Flow

| Field | Value |
| --- | --- |
| What | Accepted complete whole farmed Salmonidae biomass at first producer handover |
| How much | 1 kg net wet fish mass, excluding ice, free water and containers |
| How well | Actual species, food use, complete unheaded/ungutted condition and declared live/fresh/chilled state; no universal size or moisture requirement |
| How long or cycle | Actual linked hatchery/seed, grow-out, fallowing/cleaning, harvest and pre-gate handling periods; include cohort and shared-asset service periods |
| reference_flow_link | `farmed_salmonidae_handover` |


| Field | Value |
| --- | --- |
| Reference amount | 1 |
| Reference product flow | Whole farmed Salmonidae at first producer handover |
| Reference flow property | Mass `93a60a56-a3c8-11da-a746-0800200b9a66` |
| Reference unit group | Units of mass `93a60a57-a4c8-11da-a746-0800200c9a66` |
| Reference unit | kg |
| Required qualifiers | Species/family; aquaculture origin; actual live/fresh/chilled state; complete unheaded/ungutted form; producer gate; geography/date; culture technology; freshwater/marine stage topology; seed ownership/provider; cohort; weighing/tare/free-water protocol; actual pre-gate transport and preservation; intended outputs; allocation/service periods |

Required qualifiers belong in dataset metadata, process/reference notes or an equivalent foreground package field. A missing actual state, origin or gate is incomplete evidence, not an assumed default. Common 1 kg mass does not assert equivalent quality or shelf life across states.

## 4. Measurement and Unit Rules

| rule_id | Applies to | Required property | Required unit | Rule |
| --- | --- | --- | --- | --- |
| reference_mass | reference product | Mass `93a60a56-a3c8-11da-a746-0800200b9a66` | kg | Measure accepted whole fish net wet mass using cp_mass; subtract container tare, ice and free water, with actual drainage/handling condition. Final reference output is 1 kg; internal transfers use measured amounts. |
| stock_count_mass | stocking and transfer rows | Mass `93a60a56-a3c8-11da-a746-0800200b9a66` | kg | Count conversion uses contemporaneous representative individual wet mass by species/stage/lot from cp_stock_seed_rearing; cp_stock_grow_out; cp_stock_pre_gate_transfer; cp_stock_harvest; cp_stock_preservation; cp_stock_dispatch; cp_stock_shared_services; retain sampling uncertainty. No universal fish/kg conversion. |
| material_basis | feed; treatment; water; packaging | Mass `93a60a56-a3c8-11da-a746-0800200b9a66` | kg | Retain purchased formulation mass, dry matter/active content and element-versus-compound basis separately; volume-to-mass uses actual density and count-to-mass actual sample evidence. |
| energy_units | electricity and delivered heat | Net calorific value `93a60a56-a3c8-11da-a746-0800200c9a66` | kWh; MJ | Preserve electrical kWh and heat MJ; energy unit group 93a60a57-a3c8-11da-a746-0800200c9a66 gives 3.6 MJ per kWh. Do not substitute fuel mass for delivered heat. |
| normalization_definition | all inventory rows | actual row property | actual numerator unit per kg reference | Normalize attributable lot amounts once by accepted final net fish mass; keep actual cohort movements, loss and allocation records. Every amount and Range basis is per 1 kg reference flow. |

Every non-reference Range below is a finite provisional author reasoned estimate used solely for QA screening in the actual stated role. Zero is applicable only when the activity/material is evidenced absent; it does not assert zero burden. Broad water ranges accommodate different circulation/intake and technology scales; stock, feed, energy and material bounds screen recording mistakes rather than prescribe efficiency, stocking, medication or legal limits. Actual records and reviewed site evidence take precedence; investigate values outside a screen and document justified replacement. The final 1–1 kg Range is the method definition of the reference quantity, not an empirical yield interval.

## 5. System Boundary

### Boundary Abstraction

| Field | Value |
| --- | --- |
| declared_starting_condition | Actual owned broodstock/egg/juvenile stages or purchased seed stage entering the producer system, with provider gate, upstream burden and stage ownership |
| starting_condition_role | Explicit foreground cut-in; not a claim that unobserved purchased hatchery/feed/material burdens are zero |
| product_classification_scope | Aquaculture Salmonidae human food; whole unheaded/ungutted narrower presentation |
| recursive_input_rule | If same-category fish enters breeding/grow-out/holding, record actual purpose, stage and upstream provider/version separately; stop recursion at an evidenced upstream dataset boundary, never replace an input with the final reference output |
| upstream_dataset_requirement | Seed/provider and feed ingredients/processing; water, energy and material supply; controlled pre-gate transport; relevant infrastructure manufacture, maintenance and end-of-life; disclose missing evidence |
| disclosure | Actual stage graph; own/purchased seed; technology and region; freshwater/marine source and discharge; live/fresh/chilled handover; periods/cohorts; support assets; direct releases; included/excluded upstream and post-gate operations; unresolved evidence |

### Boundary Rules

| rule_id | Applies to | Rule | source_ids |
| --- | --- | --- | --- |
| boundary_route | grow_out and seed_rearing | Include actual producer-controlled biological stages and upstream purchased inputs. Own-versus-purchased stage alternatives use required parent grow_out and traced stage/cohort flags. Freshwater trout does not require marine grow-out or smoltification. | `fao-trout-culture`; `fao-atlantic-salmon-culture` |
| boundary_technology | grow_out | Declare parent grow_out, actual flow-through/raceway, RAS or cage delta, water/infrastructure requirements and stage-specific coexistence. Include evidenced smolt readiness and pre-gate transfer for actual anadromous marine routes only. | `fao-trout-culture`; `fao-atlantic-salmon-culture`; `noaa-atlantic-salmon-aquaculture` |
| boundary_harvest | harvest | Keep removal/acceptance separate from biomass growth so harvest resources, actual whole-fish state and losses can be reconciled at their own handoff. | `fao-trout-culture`; `fao-atlantic-salmon-culture` |
| boundary_handling | preservation and dispatch | Include actual whole-fish live holding/chilling and packaging before first producer gate; record before/after state and duration. Independent processor transport, gut/head removal, filleting and freezing lie outside the declared category. | `noaa-atlantic-salmon-aquaculture` |
| boundary_upstream | purchased inputs | Require upstream provider burden for actual seed, feed, treatment, utility, transfer and material purchases; prevent on-site and supplier processes from covering the same stage twice. | `fao-atlantic-salmon-culture`; `ghg-product-allocation` |
| boundary_water_release | water and emissions | Separate purchased water, resource withdrawal, circulation, return, collected waste and actual receiving-medium emissions. Reconcile any aggregated effluent model to separately reported substances and sludge. | `noaa-atlantic-salmon-aquaculture` |
| boundary_period_assets | all selected stages | Include relevant periods, fallowing/cleaning, shared assets, replacement and termination; identify every consuming node and attribute manufacture, maintenance and end-of-life once using actual service evidence. | `ghg-product-allocation` |

## 6. Process Inventory Structure

### Process Map

| process_id | process_name | inclusion | inclusion_condition | role | quantitative_reference |
| --- | --- | --- | --- | --- | --- |
| `seed_rearing` | Owned hatchery and early rearing | conditional | Owned broodstock, eggs, fry, parr or smolt production before grow_out; purchased stages replace only the evidenced omitted owned stages | Managed biological child; parent grow_out; actual early-life stage handoff | actual attributable stage quantities per 1 kg reference flow |
| `grow_out` | Managed Salmonidae grow-out | required | All qualifying aquaculture lots | Managed biological production parent; actual freshwater or staged marine route | actual attributable stage quantities per 1 kg reference flow |
| `pre_gate_transfer` | Producer controlled culture-stage transfer | conditional | Actual producer-controlled stock movement before the producer gate, including evidenced smolt transfer | Transfer child of grow_out; excludes transfer after independent processor handover | actual attributable stage quantities per 1 kg reference flow |
| `harvest` | Removal from culture and harvest acceptance | required | Every final food-fish lot | Independent harvest boundary from cultivated stock to whole collected fish | actual attributable stage quantities per 1 kg reference flow |
| `preservation` | Whole-fish live holding or chilling | conditional | Actual intervention between harvest and first producer dispatch; actual live holding OR fresh/chilled handling selected by lot records | Preservation; harvest input to state-specific dispatch-ready whole fish | actual attributable stage quantities per 1 kg reference flow |
| `dispatch` | Presentation and first producer handover | required | First producer harvest or dispatch gate before independent processing | Packaging/presentation and accepted final reference; distribution outside | 1 kg accepted final fish |
| `shared_services` | Attributed utilities and shared infrastructure | required | Actual resources across selected stages and reporting periods; record evidenced absence | Supporting resources attributed once to seed_rearing, grow_out, transfer, harvest, preservation and dispatch | actual attributable stage quantities per 1 kg reference flow |

Batch/cohort ids link hatchery, grow-out, actual transfers, harvest and dispatch across calendar periods. A continuous water/utility ledger must still retain cohort attribution; cleaning, fallowing and changeover events belong to the actual run or affected production period. Required parent `grow_out` owns all seed-production and technology alternatives. `shared_services` carries attributable resources for every selected consumer once; consumer sections refer to this ledger rather than duplicating exchanges. Each conditional card instantiates zero, one or multiple concrete exchanges from actual site records. Resolve actual material/substance, provider, state, destination and unit before downstream publication.

###### Non-viable whole harvested fish sent to disposal (`harvest_rejects`)

Only non-viable whole fish actually rejected and handed to the documented waste recipient, by species, event and measured wet fish mass. Exclude incidental sediment, gear and other materials, live stock remaining in production, saleable fish and free drainage. Every actual non-fish material still requires its own identified atomic exchange and destination under the existing waste collection protocol; missing identity blocks completion, not a zero.

This card records only the named atomic exchange, retaining the existing collection protocol, attribution and reference denominator. Use actual records for its own quantity, never a copied parent or sibling total; unknown occurrence or identity is not zero.

###### Aquaculture wastewater from shared_services handed to external treatment (`effluent_treatment_shared_services`)

Only actual wastewater generated by shared_services, of one recorded composition/salinity and treatment handover identity. Retain unique source-stage, unit, cohort, event, quantity and receiving-provider records in the shared ledger; do not merge a different source or receiving boundary into this card. Record only the external handover, not duplicate untreated direct releases or collected sludge. If wastewater is physically mixed before a handover, establish one separate composition-defined mixed-wastewater exchange and exclude its constituents from these uncombined-source cards.

This card records only the named atomic exchange, retaining the existing collection protocol, attribution and reference denominator. Use actual records for its own quantity, never a copied parent or sibling total; unknown occurrence or identity is not zero.

## 7. Allocation and Co-product Handling

| rule_id | Applies to | Rule | source_ids |
| --- | --- | --- | --- |
| allocation_subdivision | all intended outputs | Enumerate reference fish and every actual intentional output with purpose, state, handover and period. Subdivide independently metered hatchery, grow-out, transfer and handling operations before allocation. | `ghg-product-allocation` |
| allocation_causal | shared output burdens | If subdivision is insufficient, use evidenced causal physical drivers such as actual feed, biomass-time, water/energy service or limiting load; a convenient mass fraction alone is not proof of causality. | `ghg-product-allocation` |
| allocation_fallback | unresolved physical causality | Only where a causal relation cannot be supported, disclose economic fallback using representative actual quantities and contemporaneous prices; assess sensitivity and state the reason for the fallback. | `ghg-product-allocation` |
| allocation_residues | loss, waste and non-reference products | Do not assign final fish reference mass to rejects, mortalities, escaped stock or other products. A purposeful saleable output is not simultaneously disposal waste; treatment and upstream burdens remain explicit. | `ghg-product-allocation` |
| allocation_carryover | retained broodstock and standing stock | Allocate production inputs to actual period cohorts; carry forward evidenced attributable burden for retained broodstock/standing fish into the next period, with consistent opening/closing stock and no loss or duplicate recognition. Escapes have separate stock/fate records, not automatic disposal waste or co-products. | `ghg-product-allocation` |
| allocation_periods | cohorts and shared_services | Link early-life, grow-out, fallowing/cleaning, harvest and asset service to actual cohorts, runs and periods. Enumerate all asset consumers, replacement and termination events; attribution shares must reconcile across all periods without repeating manufacture or utilities. | `ghg-product-allocation` |

### Outsourced operation coverage

Where an actual hatchery, transport, harvest, handling or treatment operation is contracted, link the provider process once to the consuming stage using its actual contracted performance and independently evidenced reference property/unit (for example, documented transport performance). Record operator, boundary, delivered performance, upstream dataset and service share in cp_services_seed_rearing; cp_services_grow_out; cp_services_pre_gate_transfer; cp_services_harvest; cp_services_preservation; cp_services_dispatch; cp_services_shared_services. Do not impose kg material amounts or a generic kg-to-service conversion. Tangible fish, materials and carriers remain in their own cards; exclude resources already covered by the provider process.

### Data Quality Requirements

| requirement_id | Applies to | Requirement | Evidence |

Collect under `cp_waste_grow_out` and normalize to final accepted net fish mass. Establish independent Range evidence and exact UUID for each child; no grouped total, bound or binding is inherited.

| `dq_atomic_card_identity` | all inventory rows | Each card represents one physically identified exchange, not a collection or selector. Keep Electricity as one electrical-energy flow; supplier, geography and voltage remain actual collected qualifiers, not grounds for speculative splitting. Other actual materials, waste streams, carbon origins and receiving media must have separate identities and atomic cards before completion. Preserve every existing collection obligation; an absent card or unresolved identity never means zero or a waived exchange. Paired internal water transfers retain the same actual quality, transfer id, quantity and upstream burden, without another purchase. | Per-card identity, provider, state, destination and paired records |
| `dq_atomic_range_evidence` | repaired atomic flow cards | U_row is an unresolved evidence requirement, not a numerical estimate, default, clipping limit or completeness pass. Establish each card's own matching-unit/reference-basis upper envelope from independent representative records or a compatible documented supplier/design bound, retaining scope, method and uncertainty. Do not reuse a removed aggregate range, copy a sibling quantity, derive a bound from the target batch itself or invent a value. Applicable missing evidence blocks quantitative QA completion; actual measurements remain required. | Independent envelope evidence; retained raw records and uncertainty |

## 9. Validation Rules

| rule_id | Applies to | Rule | source_ids |
| --- | --- | --- | --- |
| validate_reference | farmed_salmonidae_handover | Confirm complete food Salmonidae, aquaculture origin, actual live/fresh/chilled state and first producer gate; cp_mass supports 1 kg net wet fish excluding ice, water and containers. | `salmonidae-reference-definition` |
| validate_routes | grow_out and route alternatives | Required parent grow_out exists; own/purchased stage flags and technology deltas have current evidence and coherent coexistence. Freshwater-only trout has no automatic smolt or sea stage; evidenced staged marine routes include pre-gate transfer resources. | `fao-trout-culture`; `fao-atlantic-salmon-culture`; `noaa-atlantic-salmon-aquaculture` |
| validate_handoffs | all stage outputs | Actual biomass/count records reconcile growth, stocking, transfers, harvest and dispatch; internal fish amounts are not fixed to final reference. State-specific preservation has before/after evidence; unknown state is a gap. |  |
| validate_water_emissions | water, waste and elementary cards | Separate supply, abstraction, circulation, return, sludge and pollutant ledgers; every actual emission has substance, element/compound basis, receiving medium and evidence. Aggregated effluent cannot duplicate substances. | `noaa-atlantic-salmon-aquaculture` |
| validate_energy | shared_services | Match actual region/voltage/provider, heat and fuel grade; reconcile meters and direct combustion without double-counting upstream fuel/heat or non-fossil CO2. |  |
| validate_outputs | intentional outputs and disposal | Enumerate actual output handovers, residues, waste, mortality, escapes and losses. Verify subdivision/causal allocation before disclosed fallback, with all shared burdens and service periods counted once. | `ghg-product-allocation` |
| validate_coverage | foreground package | Report performed and skipped checks, missing supplier/measurement/identity evidence, screening departures and uncertainties; only a completed data package with concrete verified exchanges can be finalized. |  |
| `validate_inventory_completion` | all concrete exchanges and section 8 completion obligations | Verify each applicable dq_complete obligation has separately measured and identity-verified exchange cards. Check each quantity, native unit, range evidence, normalization, receiving medium, destination and non-duplication. Any unfulfilled actual child exchange, quantity, identity or destination makes the final dataset incomplete and fails validation; unknown cannot be zero. Static PCR checking does not replace this evidence. |  |
