# Wild whole head-on chilled otter-trawl white shrimp

## 1. Scope and Applicability

This PCR covers the selected US Gulf near-bottom otter-trawl channel for wild Litopenaeus setiferus delivered raw, whole, head-on, shell-on, chilled and never frozen to the first physical recipient of the harvester's product. It covers capture through recipient acceptance before heading, peeling, cooking or freezing. Other species, farmed shrimp and other gear, regions or product states require another declared methodology.

NOAA supports the species, region and near-bottom trawl route. The 2003 extension curriculum distinguishes ice and freezer boats and head-on and tail channels; its detailed washing examples largely concern headed shrimp. It establishes channel context, not universal whole-product practice. Actual whole-product washing, dip, icing and presentation must be documented; no heading operation, chemical prescription, dose, ice ratio, safety limit or trip duration is inferred. The sources do not establish current practice proportions.

| --- | --- | --- | --- | --- |
| `reference_mass` | reference product | Mass `93a60a56-a3c8-11da-a746-0800200b9a66` | kg | Weigh accepted net shrimp mass A on a calibrated scale for the same identified lot; subtract measured tare and separately measured free ice/water. Head and native shell remain included. Use cp_receipt. |
| `native_units` | all inventory rows | Actual instance property | Actual native unit | Preserve each concrete exchange's verified property/unit. Convert count/volume to mass or electricity units only with traceable configuration, density or unit evidence. U_instance denotes the independently determined upper quantity bound for each actual instance, expressed in that instance's native unit; it is not a unit label or mixed-unit total. |
| `state_transfer` | product transfers | Mass | kg | Pair real upstream output and downstream input by transfer id, species, state and measured net mass; retain losses and wash/dip retention separately. Never force an internal feed to 1 kg or equal captured stock to accepted mass. |

## 5. System Boundary

### Boundary Abstraction

| Field | Value |
| --- | --- |
| declared_starting_condition | Wild white shrimp in the declared US Gulf capture context; vessel and gear readiness, trips/hauls, actual device configuration, previous stocks and supply/service ownership declared |
| starting_condition_role | Natural capture context, not a purchased farmed adult or burden-free harvested-product input |
| product_classification_scope | Selected semantic whole head-on chilled wild-white-shrimp route only; classification coverage is broader |
| recursive_input_rule | Purchased same-category shrimp must retain supplier/gate/state and complete upstream capture/handling dataset; do not restart it as wild stock or suppress previous burdens. Such mixed purchased/own-caught lots need explicit separate attribution and scope review. |
| upstream_dataset_requirement | Attach complete actual supplied fuel, electricity, ice, formulation, packaging, equipment and service datasets at their real gates. Keep foreground direct operation/emissions/assets separate only where not included in the purchased full service. |
| disclosure | Species and output destinations, capture area/gear/devices, trip and lot lineage, actual optional nodes, stock and loss records, periods/assets, data gaps, attribution and actual direct/background ownership |

### Boundary Rules

| rule_id | Applies to | Rule | source_ids |
| --- | --- | --- | --- |
| `capture_context` | capture | Capture removes wild stock independently of sorting/conditioning. Record actual area, haul effort, seabed contact and turtle/bycatch devices and observed interactions. Devices do not imply zero bycatch, zero mortality or zero habitat effects. Keep ecological observations and omissions visible without inventing pollutant exchanges. | `noaa-white-shrimp` |
| `route_states` | process map | Capture hands unsorted whole catch to sorting. Sorting assigns species, selected grade, other sale destinations and discard fates. Actual whole washing/dip produces a declared prepared state before icing. If inactive, identify direct sorted-to-icing handoff. Icing produces the never-frozen chilled state. Actual presentation yields packaged/crated state; if inactive, chilled product goes directly to receipt. Only recipient accepted output is final. | `haby-miget-wild-shrimp-2003` |
| `operation_ownership` | all nodes | Record all actual fuel, power, water, cleaning, materials, direct combustion/leakage and treatment at the responsible node. A complete purchased operational service and its separately itemized fuel/emissions/assets are mutually exclusive. Purchased fuel/power production remains upstream. Onsite power is an internal transfer from recorded generation, not additional grid supply. | |
| `period_assets` | trips and infrastructure | Reporting coverage includes preparation, steaming, hauling, nonproductive/failed trips, handling/holding, cleaning, changeovers, maintenance, replacement and termination. Identify vessel/engine, gear/devices, cold hold, pumps, scales, handling equipment and crates as applicable, consuming nodes and periods; retain one owner for each event and asset service share. | |
| `recipient_gate` | receipt | Include actual unloading and acceptance needed for first physical receipt. Exclude recipient heading/freezing/processing, onward distribution and retail. Product acceptance, package handoff and waste fate are separate; receipt is not remote dispatch or retail delivery. | |
| `fate_boundary` | waste and direct discharge | Record actual retained waste with treatment/provider and full burden, or actual direct release with pollutant substance/basis/medium and water balance. Do not create elemental emissions from bulk biomass, assume disposal has no burden, or award ecological/substitution credit for discards. Returned live organisms retain recorded fate and mortality uncertainty. | |

## 6. Process Inventory Structure

### Process Map

| process_id | process_name | inclusion | inclusion_condition | role | quantitative_reference |
| --- | --- | --- | --- | --- | --- |
| `capture` | Otter-trawl capture | required | US Gulf near-bottom otter trawl; trip and haul batches | Foreground otter-trawl capture; trip/haul/lot-indexed | per 1 kg reference flow |
| `sorting` | Catch sorting and destination assignment | required | Every haul; separate white shrimp, other species, grades and discard fates | Foreground catch sorting and destination assignment; trip/haul/lot-indexed | per 1 kg reference flow |
| `conditioning` | Actual whole-product washing or dip | conditional | Actual washing or dip of whole head-on shrimp; otherwise sorting hands directly to preservation | Foreground actual whole-product washing or dip; trip/haul/lot-indexed | per 1 kg reference flow |
| `preservation` | Icing and chilled holding | required | Iced never-frozen selected whole-product channel | Foreground icing and chilled holding; trip/haul/lot-indexed | per 1 kg reference flow |
| `packaging` | Actual box or crate presentation | conditional | Actual separate box/crate presentation; otherwise preservation hands directly to receipt | Foreground actual box or crate presentation; trip/haul/lot-indexed | per 1 kg reference flow |
| `receipt` | First harvester physical recipient handover | required | Physical receipt and acceptance before heading or freezing | Foreground first harvester physical recipient handover; trip/haul/lot-indexed | per 1 kg reference flow |

All rows use the same accepted-lot denominator after attribution. Applicable Section 8 collection obligations require one independently identified card for each actual exchange; each species/state/fate mass instance has its own U_row,i, and no common upper bound is imposed on their sum; U_row,i is the unresolved finite upper bound for each independently recorded concrete mass instance of that row (including each species/state/fate) and U_instance is an independently determined finite upper bound for one native-unit instance. These provisional intervals document missing range evidence; they are not measured defaults or strict QA limits. Each instance retains its own property, native unit, amount, factor and destination. Do not sum unlike materials, services, species or pollutants.

## 7. Allocation and Co-product Handling

| rule_id | Applies to | Rule | source_ids |
| --- | --- | --- | --- |
| `direct_assignment` | all nodes | Subdivide independently measured haul, species, grade, handling lot and destination first. Directly assign dedicated conditioning, ice, packaging, receipt and treatment to their actual lots. Internal handoffs carry lineage, not a second allocated final product. | |
| `mixed_trip` | unresolved shared capture duty | For indivisible mixed-catch trip propulsion/gear duty, retain all intended sale products, including other shrimp species and retained bycatch, at their actual states and gates. After direct assignment, use observed sale-value shares at the same first-recipient transaction period for residual mixed-product capture burdens, because effort jointly obtains economically intended catch and unlike states are not physically equivalent. Record species/grade-specific net quantities and realized unit prices, aggregate value once, explain this causal choice and report mass-share sensitivity using comparable recorded whole-product bases. Missing prices, output sets or state conversions require review, not a default share. Waste/discards receive no sale-value share but their handling/treatment remains with the generating product system. | |
| `period_assignment` | reporting-period trip and fixed events | Assign each productive trip once; assign failed/nonproductive trips and period cleaning/maintenance to the declared fleet/gear output population of the same period before residual mixed-output allocation. Include all intended outputs of that population. Never divide nonproductive duty by zero or drop it; disclose the pooling boundary and sensitivity. | |
| `asset_assignment` | shared assets and services | Use actual metered consumption for shared energy/water; otherwise documented equipment operating hours or load-time for the consuming nodes and periods. Allocate capital/gear replacement by documented service consumption over actual lifetime with maintenance/replacement/termination evidence. Enumerate every consumer, reconcile shares to one supplied total and exclude shares already inside full services. Crates use documented completed uses and actual losses; no universal lifetime or reuse count. | |
| `single_denominator` | all rows | After attribution, divide each actual exchange by A, accepted net kg of the same final selected lot or explicitly matched reporting population. Do not allocate internal product transfers again or treat mixed catch, rejected biomass, ice, tare or headed/frozen destinations as reference output. | |

The collection-obligation template does not certify a calculated release as measured; no universal emission factor is supplied.

### Calculation Rules

| rule_id | Applies to | Formula or rule | Inputs | Output | source_ids |
| --- | --- | --- | --- | --- | --- |
| `lot_normalization` | all inventory rows | Divide the attributable exchange quantity by accepted net kg A of the same reference lot or explicitly matched population. Internal transfers retain their measured quantities; each native-unit instance is calculated independently. For derived direct releases, establish the raw release quantity and evidence under release_evidence_mode before this division. | attributable quantity; accepted net kg A; node-specific protocol; attribution ledger | exchange per 1 kg reference flow | |

| `direct_release` | direct emissions | Use actual measured release or actual owned activity times a documented compatible factor. Retain fuel carbon/substance basis, source version, receiving medium and uncertainty; factor emissions are absent when the complete operational service already owns them. | node activity; measured release or compatible factor; ownership ledger | independent actual pollutant amount | |

### Data Quality Requirements

| requirement_id | Applies to | Requirement | Evidence |
| --- | --- | --- | --- |
| `identity_quality` | all exchanges | Resolve each actual instance with verified flow/property/unit support, supplier/gate, species/state or pollutant substance/basis/medium before final exchange construction; collection scopes do not supply a universal UUID. | detail confirmation and foreground specifications |
| `period_quality` | trips and assets | Cover the declared representative reporting period, all included failed/nonproductive trips, holding, cleaning/changeover and replacement phases; reconcile opening/closing stocks and asset service consumption. | trip logs; receipts; stock ledger; asset register |
| `amount_quality` | every card | Record calibrated or traceable measurements, units, uncertainty and A. All 0..U_row,i or 0..U_instance ranges are provisional unresolved evidence placeholders with independently established finite actual bounds still required; they are not empirical intervals, hard acceptance defaults or replacement measurements. Final 1..1 is only same-lot normalization. | node protocols; bound rationale; calibration and checks |
| `source_quality` | route and amount evidence | Historical handling guidance is qualitative route context, especially for headed examples; actual whole-product practice and all quantities need current foreground records. No cited route source establishes fuel, ice, chemical, release or capital amounts. | declared source applicability and actual records |

| `dq_logistics_water_balance` | logistics, services and water/nutrient balances | Actual payload includes accompanying water, ice, packaging and other cargo. Empty return/repositioning still consumes activity: account for its actual fuel/distance/vehicle service and explicit attribution; zero cargo tonne-kilometres cannot erase that duty. Do not duplicate a complete service and covered fuel, materials, assets or direct releases. Measure external abstraction, supplied water product, internal circulation and actual returned/discharged water separately; never deduct internal recirculation again from external intake. Net nutrient increment/retention is a separate balance diagnostic, never automatically a negative elementary flow, negative emission or avoided burden. | Actual load/vehicle duty records, service scope, same-lot water/substance balance and method evidence |
| `dq_atomic_card_identity` | all inventory rows | Each card represents one physically identified exchange, not a collection or selector. Keep Electricity as one electrical-energy flow; supplier, geography and voltage remain actual collected qualifiers, not grounds for speculative splitting. Other actual materials, waste streams, carbon origins and receiving media must have separate identities and atomic cards before completion. Preserve every existing collection obligation; an absent card or unresolved identity never means zero or a waived exchange. Paired internal water transfers retain the same actual quality, transfer id, quantity and upstream burden, without another purchase. | Per-card identity, provider, state, destination and paired records |
| `dq_atomic_range_evidence` | repaired atomic flow cards | U_row is an unresolved evidence requirement, not a numerical estimate, default, clipping limit or completeness pass. Establish each card's own matching-unit/reference-basis upper envelope from independent representative records or a compatible documented supplier/design bound, retaining scope, method and uncertainty. Do not reuse a removed aggregate range, copy a sibling quantity, derive a bound from the target batch itself or invent a value. Applicable missing evidence blocks quantitative QA completion; actual measurements remain required. | Independent envelope evidence; retained raw records and uncertainty |

## 9. Validation Rules

| rule_id | Applies to | Rule | source_ids |
| --- | --- | --- | --- |
| `reference_validation` | accepted_white_shrimp | Verify species, wild US Gulf near-bottom otter-trawl route, whole head-on shell-on raw chilled never-frozen accepted state and first-recipient physical gate; A is positive and excludes measured free ice/water and tare. Reject other species/states as reference denominator. | |
| `handoff_validation` | process map and transfers | Verify actual optional-node states and transfer ids. Each real transfer has one output/input pairing at measured mass; only accepted_white_shrimp is normalized final output. Unknown washing/dip/presentation state requires review, not an inactive default. | |
| `mixed_output_validation` | capture sorting and receipt | Reconcile all species/grade/state destinations, intended sale outputs, live returns, rejects and discards. Check direct assignment, observed-value residual mixed-trip shares and comparable mass-share sensitivity; no duplicate final gates or waste sale allocation. | |
| `period_shared_validation` | operations assets and periods | Check all productive/nonproductive trip coverage, event ownership, consumer/period shares, actual lifetime/replacement evidence, and capital/service exclusions. Shares reconcile to one total before same-lot normalization. | |
| `release_validation` | each direct-operation node | Verify direct fuel and CO2 plus actual non-CO2 combustion/leak/discharge coverage for capture, sorting, conditioning, preservation, packaging and receipt when present. Separate CO2 from other releases; confirm pollutant identity/basis/medium, measured/factor evidence and no full-service duplicate. Onsite electricity is not additional grid demand. | |
| `evidence_validation` | all amounts and bindings | Check node-specific collection links, actual native units and uncertainty, independently supported instance bounds, current projection and bilingual alignment. Provisional symbolic ranges and unresolved identities cannot certify empirical quantities or final UUID readiness; unresolved final reference product blocks active/publication. | |
| `validate_atomic_completion` | all applicable per-flow collection obligations and final exchanges | Final dataset completion and validation require every actual exchange to have an independent atomic card and its own quantity, property/native unit, collection or calculation evidence, range/uncertainty evidence, normalization, actual destination and verified UUID. Unknown identity, activity state, quantity, range evidence or fate blocks completion; it is never zero, a presumed bypass or permission to omit an obligation. Every important concrete flow retains its own range/uncertainty evidence collection duty; a symbolic upper bound is not an empirical range. | |
