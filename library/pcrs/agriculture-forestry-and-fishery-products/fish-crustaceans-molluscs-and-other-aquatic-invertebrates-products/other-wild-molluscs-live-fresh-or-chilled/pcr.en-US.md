# Wild live whole pot-caught common whelks

## 1. Scope and Applicability

This PCR covers wild common whelks (Buccinum undatum) captured in UK marine waters with baited seabed pots, delivered alive and whole in their native shells to the first harvester physical recipient. The declared LCA gate is the recipient's physical acceptance before cooking or extraction; invoice date, change of legal ownership and vessel landing alone do not establish that gate. Actual receipt and live-state records must establish the selected lot. This is a selected live route, not a claim about the proportion of contemporary whelk trade sold live.

Exclude other gastropods, farming or grow-out, non-pot capture, dead, frozen, cooked or extracted-meat reference products. Cooking, picking, depuration and any particular cooling regime are not universal obligations. Whole live shell weight cannot be replaced by warm cooked meat weight or a presumed meat yield. Seafish describes weighted plastic/net pots worked in fleets with bait; its general impact and bycatch descriptions do not establish zero bycatch, zero gear loss or impact factors for a concrete fishery. The 1997 live-handling source is used only for the existence of live transport/storage; its landing-page abstract supplies no modern quantitative default.

## 3. Reference Flow

| Field | Value |
| --- | --- |
| What | Accepted live whole wild pot-caught common whelks at first harvester physical recipient |
| How much | 1 kg accepted net whole live mass |
| How well | Buccinum undatum; UK marine wild stock; baited seabed pots; alive and whole in native shells; recorded recipient acceptance |
| How long or cycle | Complete declared fishing trips and reporting period, including failed trips, returns and necessary pre-gate shore support; link multiyear vessel/gear service periods, replacements and termination |
| reference_flow_link | `whelks_accepted_live` |

| Field | Value |
| --- | --- |
| Reference amount | 1 |
| Reference product flow | Live whole wild pot-caught common whelks at first recipient acceptance |
| Reference flow property | Mass `93a60a56-a3c8-11da-a746-0800200b9a66` |
| Reference unit group | Units of mass `93a60a57-a4c8-11da-a746-0800200c9a66` |
| Reference unit | kg |
| Required qualifiers | Species; wild origin; UK capture area and landing/recipient locations; pot and bait route; trip/period and cohort/lot; live whole native-shell state; actual handling interventions; physical acceptance time and recipient; net-mass drainage/tare method; intended-output and reject destinations |

All required qualifiers must be declared in the foreground package. Shell and animal tissue remain one reference product; no shell coproduct exists before opening. Exclude foreign loose material, free seawater, bait, bags, ice and container tare from net mass. Record any drainage method without inventing a universal duration or dehydrating the animals to achieve a mass convention.

## 4. Measurement and Unit Rules

| rule_id | Applies to | Required property | Required unit | Rule |
| --- | --- | --- | --- | --- |
| `reference_mass` | reference product | Mass `93a60a56-a3c8-11da-a746-0800200b9a66` | kg | Weigh accepted live whole lots using calibrated scales and paired gross/tare records under cp_gate; retain species, live state, drainage and recipient receipt evidence. Counts, bag weights and cooked-meat masses cannot replace actual calibrated net live mass. |
| `transfer_mass` | animal transfers | Mass | kg | Record each actual animal handoff with one transfer id and paired sender/recipient mass, state and time; internal transfer quantities remain measured and are never fixed at 1 kg. |
| `native_units` | expanded resource and service exchanges | Actual per-instance property | Actual native unit | Preserve fuel/water/gear mass, energy and invoice-native service units separately; convert only with documented compatible property/unit support and actual conversion evidence. Never label a vessel-hour or inclusive holding service as kg. |

## 5. System Boundary

### Boundary Abstraction

| Field | Value |
| --- | --- |
| declared_starting_condition | Wild Buccinum undatum present in UK marine waters before pot capture; no managed grow-out stage declared |
| starting_condition_role | Natural-stock capture context, with actual extraction and fishery interventions recorded; not a burden-free purchased input |
| product_classification_scope | Narrow UK live whole common-whelk pot route within Other wild molluscs, live, fresh or chilled |
| recursive_input_rule | Purchased same-category whelks require a separate origin/route/gate-compatible upstream dataset and lot chain; record as purchased input, never as this vessel's wild withdrawal; incompatible origin is outside this PCR |
| upstream_dataset_requirement | Verified origin-compatible bait, fuels, gear, energy, packaging and services with explicit inclusive boundaries; same-category purchased animals need upstream harvest burdens |
| disclosure | Capture and landing areas; vessel and gear; bait identity and origin; reporting periods; recipient gate; actual interventions and bypasses; shared assets/service consumers; stock and loss reconciliation; data gaps |

### Boundary Rules

| rule_id | Applies to | Rule | source_ids |
| --- | --- | --- | --- |
| `boundary_capture` | capture | Include actual pot deployment, soak/hauling and vessel operations, bait procurement/use, gear manufacture/repair/loss/retrieval, incidentals and returns; include failed trips in the declared period. Capture removes wild stock independently of managed biological production or subsequent cleaning. | seafish-whelk-pots |
| `boundary_gate` | whole system | Include all harvester-controlled or purchased activities necessary to achieve first physical recipient acceptance, including actual pre-gate shore support and transport. Exclude post-acceptance storage, resale, cooking and extraction. This is the PCR-declared boundary proved by actual receipt records. | |
| `boundary_interventions` | sorting; conditioning; preservation; presentation | Sorting receives raw or actually conditioned live catch and records accepted live grades, intended secondary destinations and rejects separately. Include bounded cleaning only when performed; animal lots bypass equipment-only cleaning. Live support may begin immediately after capture and overlap sorting, presentation or delivery. Register actual input/output interfaces and events without imposing a universal serial order, depuration, temperature or storage duration. | seafish-whelk-pots; seafish-live-whelk-1997 |
| `boundary_shared` | support; assets | Enumerate vessel, hauler, pots/ropes, shore facilities and shared services, every consuming node and period, production/repair/replacement/retirement phases and evidence for attribution. One event has one owner. Select either inclusive purchased service burdens or disaggregated direct resources/emissions/capital for the same scope. | |
| `boundary_losses` | all nodes | Reconcile live catch, returns, retained outputs, bait stocks/remainders/discards, mortalities, animal rejects, gear loss/retrieval and residues with actual destination/status. Record unresolved differences; do not assume bycatch negligible, all dead animals coproducts or all rejects unusable secondary outputs. | seafish-whelk-pots |

## 6. Process Inventory Structure

### Process Map

| process_id | process_name | inclusion | inclusion_condition | role | quantitative_reference |
| --- | --- | --- | --- | --- | --- |
| `pot_capture` | Pot capture and vessel/gear support | required | Selected baited seabed-pot route | Trip/batch wild-stock removal and collected-catch handoff | per 1 kg reference flow |
| `catch_sorting` | Catch sorting and destination grading | required | Record actual live grades and reject/destination states | Independent sorting responsibility | per 1 kg reference flow |
| `primary_cleaning` | Bounded primary cleaning/preparation | conditional | Actual animal washing/debris removal or equipment-only cleaning before gate | Raw-to-prepared responsibility; animal bypass explicit | per 1 kg reference flow |
| `live_support` | Bounded live holding and preservation | conditional | Actual pre-gate intervention maintaining live state, on vessel or shore | Live-state preservation; may overlap other nodes | per 1 kg reference flow |
| `lot_presentation` | Lot containment and presentation | conditional | Actual bags, bins, labels or other presentation before acceptance | Product/package interface; logistics owned by gate node | per 1 kg reference flow |
| `recipient_gate` | Pre-gate delivery and physical acceptance | required | Each selected reference lot | Delivery, acceptance measurement and final output | per 1 kg reference flow |

Trip batches are linked to lots and a complete reporting period. Record departure/return, deployed and recovered pots, hauling, zero landings, cleaning/changeovers, actual conditional node instances and destination events. Transfer ids link actual senders and receivers; a single lot may bypass a conditional node or receive overlapping live support. Repeat transfers need unique instance ids. Do not add fictitious animal throughput for equipment-only cleaning.

Every flow card below identifies one atomic exchange. Collection obligations in Section 8 are separate requirements, not flow cards. Expand a collection scope into actual independently identified materials, substances, outputs or services with the recorded property/native unit. Each expanded instance needs its own identity, amount, protocol evidence and independently approved U_instance; the parent's U_row is neither an aggregate ceiling nor an inherited bound. All 0..U_row ranges are provisional screening placeholders documenting missing independent quantitative evidence, not numerical estimates, observed maxima, allowed operating limits or substitutes for records. Obtain independent reviewed quantitative evidence before using them as empirical QA bounds. Zero means a documented inactive/absent exchange, not unrecorded activity. Normalize reconciled attributable quantities to the same accepted reference mass.

## 7. Allocation and Co-product Handling

| rule_id | Applies to | Rule | source_ids |
| --- | --- | --- | --- |
| `allocation_reconcile` | all outputs | Reconcile all intended species/grade outputs, internal transfers, returns, bait and gear stocks/losses and waste before allocating burdens. Native shells remain in the whole animal. Mortality, bycatch and rejects acquire product/waste/return status only from actual intent, state and destination; no automatic coproduct or substitution credit. | |
| `allocation_precedence` | shared trip and sorting outputs | This PCR selects the following allocation hierarchy, requiring concrete foreground evidence rather than deriving it from the qualitative Seafish sources: first subdivide independently metered activities; next use demonstrated causal physical service drivers for shared burdens. If unavoidable multi-output allocation remains, use measured net mass only among comparable intended whole-animal outputs; where functional/quality differences make mass unsuitable, document period-matched output value evidence and a justified economic allocation with mass sensitivity. Require an explicit decision, complete output set and handoff for each concrete dataset; no silent default or allocation to internal transfers. | |
| `allocation_periods` | multiyear assets; vessel and service periods | Link manufacture, use, repair, replacement, gear loss/retrieval and retirement to evidenced service periods and all consumers. Use actual recorded service exposure/usage shares; document remaining stock and termination, without universal lives. Include unsuccessful trips and cleaning/changeover events in the reporting period; link all shared vessel, shore facility and service consumers. Shares sum to the complete service; count each event once. | |
| `allocation_services` | purchased inclusive services | For each provider boundary choose inclusive service or its documented resources, direct emissions and capital; prevent duplicate provider burdens and duplicate cross-node/period ownership. Missing disaggregation/attribution evidence is a data gap. No automatic biodiversity, avoided-catch, seabed or ecosystem-service credit. | |

### Calculation Rules

| rule_id | Applies to | Formula or rule | Inputs | Output | source_ids |
| --- | --- | --- | --- | --- | --- |
| `normalize_records` | all inventory rows | Divide each reconciled attributable quantity by the same period's accepted net whole live reference mass in kg; retain numerator native units. The reference product divides that accepted mass by itself to give 1 kg. A period with no accepted reference output cannot produce a normalized dataset; retain its burdens in the complete attribution period. | Node-owned protocols; accepted-mass records in cp_gate; attribution decision | Quantity per 1 kg reference flow | |
| `reconcile_ledgers` | animal; bait; gear; packages | Opening stock plus receipts/withdrawals equals internal or final transfers, closing stock, returns and actual destination-specific losses with an explicit unexplained-difference record; pair internal transfer ids without treating them as final output. Reconcile before allocation and normalization. | Node-owned stock, event and handoff records | Reconciled physical/output ledgers | |
| `direct_combustion` | capture_fossil_co2; collect_capture_other_emissions; actual direct delivery emissions | Use reconciled actual fuel by fuel/engine and documented factor substance, unit and receiving medium; record factor source/version and uncertainty in the concrete dataset. Exclude respiration and provider-inclusive emissions; no universal factor is supplied here. | cp_capture; cp_gate for direct delivery; documented fuel-specific factors | Actual direct emission quantities | |

### Data Quality Requirements

| requirement_id | Applies to | Requirement | Evidence |
| --- | --- | --- | --- |
| dq_identity | all concrete exchanges | Verify species, wild UK pot route, live whole recipient gate and each concrete flow/property/unit identity; unresolved collection scope identities cannot be final exchanges. | Origin/gear records, receipts and verified identity details |
| dq_completeness | period and routes | Retain complete trips including failures, all intended destinations, stocks, returns, bait and gear losses, actual node bypass/overlap and shore support. Never use absence of records as zero. | Full period/event register and reconciliation differences |
| dq_quantities | all cards | Replace provisional U_row by independently reviewed quantitative evidence when empirical bounds are needed. Each expanded instance needs independent U_instance; never use the same batch maximum as its QA reference sample. No provisional bound replaces a collected amount. | Independent comparable evidence and provenance; node-owned measurements |
| dq_shared | assets and purchased services | Retain period/phase/consumer linkage and explicit allocation decision; avoid direct/inclusive-service overlap, duplicate events and fixed unproved lives. | Service/asset ledgers and complete share reconciliation |
| dq_sources | public evidence | Seafish gear page supports qualitative pot/bait process context; the 1997 Jacklin landing-page abstract supports historical live handling existence only.

This requirement is not a collection exchange, an assumed zero, or permission to copy aggregate amounts, ranges or UUIDs onto its components. Expand actual intended other species or separately marketed outputs from the same trip, with identity, live/dead state, mass, recipient and handoff; absent output needs a documented absence rather than an assumed coproduct. Flow property / unit: Mass `93a60a56-a3c8-11da-a746-0800200b9a66` / kg; Amount rule: Calculated from collected records: intended-output quantity per 1 kg reference flow before burden allocation; Value mode: Calculated value (`calculated_value`); Specificity: Product-specific (`product_specific`); Normalization basis: per 1 kg reference flow; Basis kind: Reference flow (`reference_flow`); Evidence kind: Calculated from collection (`calculated_from_collection`); Collection protocol: `cp_capture` Range-evidence collection duty (not an established interval and never copied onto each concrete exchange): Range: Provisional independent evidence need for capture_secondary; each instance independent Range role: QA guardrail (`qa_guardrail`) Lower: 0 Upper: U_capture_secondary Unit: kg Basis: per 1 kg reference flow Basis kind: Reference flow (`reference_flow`) Evidence kind: Reasoned estimate (`reasoned_estimate`) | Raw measured/activity, composition, transfer/destination, supplier scope and independent range evidence; `cp_capture`;  |

## 9. Validation Rules

| rule_id | Applies to | Rule | source_ids |
| --- | --- | --- | --- |
| `validate_scope` | reference product | Require Buccinum undatum, UK wild marine baited-pot route, live whole native-shell state and actual first-recipient acceptance. Reject cooked/meat/dead/frozen/farmed or other-species reference substitution and missing gate evidence. | seafish-whelk-pots; seafish-live-whelk-1997 |
| `validate_mass` | animal reference and transfers | Require calibrated accepted net live whole mass, paired drainage/tare records and unique transfer ids. Exclude foreign loose material/free seawater/packaging; native shell remains. The 1..1 reference range proves normalization only, not observed yield. | |
| `validate_balances` | all nodes and outputs | Reconcile complete trip/period animal, bait, gear and package records before allocation; enumerate every intended grade/species output and actual destination/handoff. Check mortality, bycatch, sea returns, unrecovered gear and landed wastes independently; no assumed zero or automatic coproduct. | |
| `validate_nodes` | conditional operations | Check actual activation/bypass, incoming/prepared/preserved/presented state and handoff, independent node-owned protocols and one owner per overlapping event. Equipment-only cleaning has no animal throughput. No fictitious serial order, mandatory depuration/cooking or universal cooling regime. | |
| `validate_attribution` | shared resources and periods | Check all consumers, service phases/replacement/termination, unsuccessful trips, complete output shares and explicit allocation decision with evidence/sensitivity. Reject duplicate direct/inclusive-service resources/emissions/capital and allocation to internal reference transfers. | |
| `validate_identity_ranges` | concrete dataset | Resolve every concrete exchange and support identity before final dataset use, preserving native service units. Every card has Range; symbolic provisional U bounds remain unresolved evidence needs and each expanded exchange has independently reviewed bounds. Missing identity, amount, destination, allocation or range evidence is disclosed as a gap and blocks unsupported finalization. | |
| `validate_atomic_completion` | all applicable collection requirements and concrete inventory exchanges | Resolve every applicable section-8 collection requirement into individual physical/chemical exchanges with their own quantities, native units, composition/state, range basis or explicit uncertainty evidence, raw records, normalization, actual destinations/receiving media and verified compatible UUIDs. Any unresolved applicable requirement makes the final dataset incomplete and validation fails; unknown is not zero. Never copy aggregate amounts onto components or duplicate inclusive services with owned fuel/electricity/direct releases. Internal transfers are not fixed to the final 1 kg. | |
