# Whole wild food crabs in shell at first producer handover

## 1. Scope and Applicability

This PCR covers wild-captured whole food crabs in native shell at one actual first producer/collector handover, with the lot declared live, fresh or nonfrozen chilled. The body retains its carapace and actual appendage condition: a missing limb does not imply an invented intact weight. Food eligibility, shell/molt state and body condition follow actual buyer and applicable jurisdiction evidence, not a species-independent minimum. The net wet whole-crab reference is neither edible meat nor a live/fresh conversion. Direct wild marine and inland capture are allowed only with their actual habitat and gear context declared.

Exclude detached legs/claws or meat, cooked/frozen/preserved product, ornamental or seed/stocking output, aquaculture, deliberate fattening, managed grow-out and induced-molt production. Bounded maintenance holding is included only without a production-growth purpose. A supplier purchase of already-marketed whole crabs cannot restart the first-producer boundary. CPC 04311 includes a wider in-shell/not-in-shell category; this methodology deliberately covers only the stated whole first-gate scope.

Fuel litres require measured supplier density at its stated condition, never a default. Gas volumes require verified pressure/temperature/purity conversion before any mass exchange. |

## 5. System Boundary

### Boundary Abstraction

| Field | Value |
| --- | --- |
| declared_starting_condition | Wild crabs and incidental taxa in the declared natural waterbody before actual capture; no owned rearing/growth stage |
| starting_condition_role | Natural capture context, not a purchased zero-burden food crab |
| product_classification_scope | Whole wild in-shell food crabs only; narrower than CPC 3.0 04311 |
| recursive_input_rule | A same-category crab purchased as bait is a separately identified supplier input with prior capture burden and non-reference use, not recursive generation of this food output; already-marketed crabs for resale are outside the first-producer reference route |
| upstream_dataset_requirement | Require compatible upstream bait/feed, fuel/electricity, gear/asset, packaging, water/gas and treatment datasets or measured supplier packages at actual gate/state; unresolved inputs retain gaps, never zero burden |
| disclosure | Declare producer/operating unit, habitat/species/gear, actual node ownership/activation, first gate, time/stock boundaries, bycatch and releases, all intended outputs and attribution; no federated multisite average |

### Boundary Rules

| rule_id | Applies to | Rule | source_ids |
| --- | --- | --- | --- |
| `boundary_capture` | all nodes | Start at wild resource removal, including attributable preparation, fuel supply, bait, gear and capital service; end at the actual first producer/collector handover. Owned handling and transport before that point are included wherever they occur. Already-purchased whole crabs that have passed a producer gate, retail/merchant holding, grow-out, fattening and induced molt are excluded reference routes. | `wild-crab-foreground-method` |
| `boundary_states` | grading; live_hold; fresh_chill; presentation | Actual onboard holding or chilling may precede grading. Record operation stage as pre_sort or post_sort; capture retained catch can go through live_hold/fresh_chill before grading, while only graded, food-accepted terminal lots enter presentation. Each holding/chilling event has one time/stage and appears once, even when the same node performs distinct pre-sort and post-sort events. Grading -> actual live_hold and/or fresh_chill -> presentation is not a compulsory chain. Bypass preserves the actual state and transfer record. Live cooling can coexist with prior live maintenance; dead fresh lots never enter live holding. At every loss or death event classify disposition and lawful food acceptance anew, never infer an inactive state or fresh recovery from missing information. | `wild-crab-foreground-method` |
| `boundary_gear` | capture | capture is the technology parent. Trap/pot deployment, bait, rope/buoy, soak and retrieval differ from line, dip-net or scrape effort, inventory and habitat-contact evidence. One deployment has one actual gear method; distinct methods may coexist in a trip only as separately indexed effort/catch records. Current operator and gear evidence, not a route label, establishes deltas. | `wild-crab-foreground-method` |
| `boundary_water` | live_hold; fresh_chill; presentation | Keep purchased water, direct withdrawal, internal circulation, evaporation, stock change, collected effluent and direct returns distinct. Dissolved pollutant mass and water carrier mass are not duplicate exchanges; keep direct substances separate by actual chemical basis and compartment. Cleaning is not assumed depuration or food-safety certification. | `wild-crab-foreground-method` |
| `boundary_shared` | capture; grading; live_hold; fresh_chill; presentation | Index the shared vessel/deck, tanks, dock cold room, ice maker and returnable containers by actual consuming nodes and service periods. One asset or operated service event has one burden owner and a complete allocation ledger. Meter own auxiliary power/ice inside its owner node; do not add purchased power/ice for the same own output or duplicate downstream service fuel. | `wild-crab-foreground-method` |
| `boundary_secondary_bait` | capture | Processing-by-product bait is secondary material from a prior product system, not a free wild resource. Identify the actual prior product, separation/recovery handoff, preservation/transport and present baiting gate from supplier evidence. The experimental literature supports route existence only, not the current lot composition/performance. This conditional interface is inactive where no such input occurs. | `cerbule-secondary-bait-2023`; `wild-crab-foreground-method` |

## 6. Process Inventory Structure

### Process Map

| process_id | process_name | inclusion | inclusion_condition | role | quantitative_reference |
| --- | --- | --- | --- | --- | --- |
| `capture` | Wild crab capture and retrieval | required | All included lots | Remove wild catch from the declared waterbody; retained catch goes to actual pre-sort preservation or grading | per 1 kg reference flow; retain measured node output |
| `grading` | Whole-catch sorting and destination grading | required | All retained catch is assigned an actual grade or destination | Separate qualifying whole food crabs, other intended landings, live releases and rejects | per 1 kg reference flow; retain measured node output |
| `live_hold` | Bounded live maintenance before first handover | conditional | Actual live crabs receive owned pre-gate maintenance; pre_sort retains pending grading and post_sort retains actual acceptance; no grow-out, fattening or induced molt | Maintain live state and explicitly separate survivors, eligible fresh diversion and mortality | per 1 kg reference flow; retain measured node output |
| `fresh_chill` | Fresh-food handling and nonfreezing chilling | conditional | Actual owned pre-gate fresh handling, intentional state change or nonfreezing chilling occurs for an eligible whole-food lot | Record actual live/fresh/chilled before-and-after states without freezing, cooking or meat separation | per 1 kg reference flow; retain measured node output |
| `presentation` | Producer presentation and first handover | required | All final reference lots, packaged or bulk | Present the selected actual whole-food state at one first producer/collector gate | per 1 kg reference flow; retain measured node output |

### Process: Wild crab capture and retrieval (`capture`)

Capture owns trip preparation, outward and return movement before the first gate, deployment, soak, hauling and retrieval. It is a harvest responsibility, not managed growth or a separate raw-material conditioning service. Gear dispatch logs identify pot/trap, trotline/handline, dip-net/scrape or another evidenced method. Pot effort includes deployed and retrieved units, bait charges, soak duration, strings/vertical lines/buoys, escapes and loss. Other gear requires its own effort and bottom-contact records; do not apply a pot count or bait assumption to nets or scraping. Capture may deliver live or already-dead food-eligible whole crabs; declare the actual state and handling time. Neither landed biomass nor gear-loss mass alone measures ecosystem damage.

###### Unsorted retained wild catch at grading intake (`capture_retained_catch`)

Link every retained target and incidental taxon to its actual next node using species/state, time, wet mass and transfer id. Target whole-crab portions may receive pre-sort live_hold or fresh_chill before grading; incidental non-crab material is separately routed to grading or its actual disposition. Do not call all retained catch qualifying final crab mass. Bait caught independently is separately identified, not duplicated here and as a reference product.

### Process: Whole-catch sorting and destination grading (`grading`)

Match incoming unsorted catch to capture and actual pre_sort holding/chilling transfer ids, without duplicating its predecessor transfer. Enumerate species, shell/molt state, sex where relevant, body/appendage condition and each actual food grade. A missing limb is not reconstructed by a conversion factor: weigh the actual qualifying whole body, and retain the buyer or authority acceptance record. An undersize or prohibited animal is not automatically a downgraded food product. Each intended other-species landing or non-reference grade has an independent handoff and allocation status. Live releases return to the declared environment; dead discards and retained wastes follow their actual separate destinations. Detached legs/claws are outside the reference category, even if sold.

### Process: Bounded live maintenance before first handover (`live_hold`)

Activate only from time-stamped ownership and intervention records. Quantify incoming live mass, tank or dry-hold method, duration, temperature and actual survival; no universal time, oxygen dose, density or salinity is prescribed. Feeding solely for bounded maintenance remains an actual input and loss source; a growth/fattening/molt-production aim is excluded. Survivors retain live state; pre_sort survivors must go to grading, directly or through recorded pre_sort chilling; post_sort accepted survivors may go to presentation or actual post_sort fresh/chill. Death is never a live yield: an independently documented, legally accepted fresh-food diversion follows its pre_sort/post_sort route with a new state record and cannot skip pending grading; otherwise classify mortality as waste. Unknown viability is a data gap, not survival. When inactive, the actual capture or grading live output bypasses to its next recorded node, preserving pending-grade status where applicable; no fictitious hold input, utility or survival yield.

###### Live whole wild crabs surviving bounded maintenance, sorting status declared (`hold_live_survivors`)

Measure live survivors retaining actual shell/appendage condition. A pre_sort output goes to grading, directly or through an actual pre_sort fresh_chill event; only a post_sort food-accepted output may go to presentation or a recorded post_sort fresh_chill event. Exclude mortality, carried stock and any growth/molt-production lot.

### Process: Fresh-food handling and nonfreezing chilling (`fresh_chill`)

Keep live cooling distinct from a dead fresh/chilled food state. Record each live input, accepted already-dead input or eligible fresh diversion separately; a lawful state transition and fresh acceptance record are required where life is lost. No operation may turn an unexplained live mortality into saleable food by relabeling it chilled. No chilling is mandatory for an immediately handed-over fresh lot; if this node is inactive, such a grading lot goes directly to presentation with its actual fresh status and elapsed time. Owned ice production is an auxiliary ledger inside this node: account water, electricity/fuel, direct releases and losses, without simultaneously buying its produced ice. The fixed ice identity below is exclusively purchased capture-fishery chilling ice.

###### Accepted whole food crabs after actual fresh handling or nonfreezing chilling (`chill_accepted_food`)

A pre_sort whole-crab output goes to grading with actual state, species, body condition, mass and time; a post_sort food-accepted output goes to presentation; an actually still-live lot receiving subsequent holding can instead transfer to hold_live_crabs at the same grading stage. Dead or unknown-viability material cannot use that live interface; every event has a unique order and transfer id. Record live survival separately and retain the entire pre-sort handling burden. This is a measured intermediate, not automatically 1 kg, and never frozen/cooked/sectioned output.

### Process: Producer presentation and first handover (`presentation`)

Only after grading and food acceptance are complete, receive exactly the measured terminal qualifying state from grading, post_sort live_hold or post_sort fresh_chill, linked by transfer id; do not add all three alternatives for one lot. Preserve live viability where sold live, and preserve the declared fresh/chilled condition otherwise. Container, binding, cushioning, label and cooling-medium masses are outside the reference net crab mass. Packaging, cleaning of returnable containers and gate-associated handling are included only when owned before the first handover; a bulk route records its actual reusable-bin/handling requirement or documented absence, not an invented package. First handover may be at vessel, shore or producer collection point as actually documented; later merchant holding, retail, external processing and distribution are outside. A lot-specific final card is instantiated to one actual species/state/gate rather than a mixture of incompatible identities.

The sole final reference: actual qualifying crab body in native shell and actual appendage condition, wet net mass excluding external water/ice/packaging. Instantiate one actual species, shell/molt grade, life/temperature state, food acceptance and gate per lot; do not average mixed live/dead states or use an edible-meat conversion.

###### Reusable transport crate accompanying the accepted crab lot (`presentation_packaging_handover`)

Conditional physical dispatch of one identified reusable transport-crate product, with actual construction material, tare, ownership and return records. This is a crate-product exchange, not the sum of boxes, ties, cushions, labels or replacement/manufacturing service shares. Existing presentation-packaging requirements still require every actual disposable item or other packaging product to be independently identified, measured and represented by its own atomic card before completion; no packaging is presumed for bulk handling.

This card records only the named atomic exchange, retaining the existing collection protocol, attribution and reference denominator. Use actual records for its own quantity, never a copied parent or sibling total; unknown occurrence or identity is not zero.

## 7. Allocation and Co-product Handling

| rule_id | Applies to | Rule | source_ids |
| --- | --- | --- | --- |
| `allocation_output` | capture; grading | Avoid attribution by separating actual dedicated efforts and downstream grade handling first. For inseparable capture joint outputs, allocate residual common effort burdens across all intended retained landings using documented landed wet mass at their first independent handoffs; treat food grades of the same reference lot once. Disclose why this physical driver represents the shared operation and test economic allocation sensitivity if values/effort strongly diverge. If a defensible driver cannot be shown, retain a joint-output package and block a single-output claim rather than silently selecting a fraction. | `wild-crab-foreground-method` |
| `allocation_losses` | all nodes | Live releases, dead discards, mortality, rejected food and waste are physical dispositions, not intended co-products merely because mass exists. Attribute their capture/handling/treatment burdens to the causative retained intended outputs, disclose actual fate, and apply no automatic substitution, ecosystem, bait-recycling or negative biomass credit. A genuinely sold non-reference output requires its separate product role and handoff record. | `wild-crab-foreground-method` |
| `allocation_periods` | all nodes | Index trips, deployments, holding batches, handling runs and reporting periods; include empty/failed trips attributable to the declared fishery. Reconcile opening/closing crab and bait stocks with dated transfers and deaths; carry their associated burdens with closing stock and release them once at later handover. Attribute vessel/gear/tank/ice-maker and crate capital from actual service history, replacement and remaining life, never a universal lifespan or a new purchase each trip. Distinguish product custody gate from resource/service accounting-period closure: an at-sea first gate is not moved to port, but actual trip-period ledgers assign necessary producer return-to-base, idling and return-cycle preparation once, with actual closure time and evidenced shares for other trips. Exclude buyer distribution and later unrelated capture; never charge the same return again to the next campaign. | `wild-crab-foreground-method` |
| `allocation_shared` | all nodes | Use measured fuel/power or operating hours and evidenced load for shared vessel, pumping and cold-room operation; use occupied mass-time or service cycles for tanks/crates only when it represents actual service. Allocate each event first across consuming nodes/periods, then intended outputs if still joint; shares must sum to one. Distinguish physical internal transfers from purchased services. Cleaning/changeover and returns have one run owner and cannot be counted again in another node. | `wild-crab-foreground-method` |
| `allocation_secondary_bait` | capture_bait | Inherit prior capture/processing shares consistently with the supplier co-product allocation, adding actual separation, recovery, preservation and transport burdens; supplier evidence must establish waste/product status and the separation gate. A supplier cut-off requires consistent supplier/receiver boundaries, explicit disclosure and alternative-inheritance sensitivity; waste status and zero burden are never defaults. Count recovery events and inherited prior-system shares once; no automatic avoided-disposal credit. | `wild-crab-foreground-method` |

## 8. Foreground Data Collection, Calculation, and Quality Rules

Declared foreground collection method: every actual node keeps a linked lot/deployment/event ledger. Weigh wet biomass and materials with calibrated scales; retain raw counters only with a representative same-species/state mass sample and its uncertainty. Meter supplied utilities and reconcile tank/asset/gear stocks. Actual mass exchanges and direct substance releases require identity-specific units and independent supplier, measurement or emission-method evidence; the qualitative route sources supply no amount factors. For the unallocated physical view, normalize measured complete-trip material partitions after matching positive state-qualified accepted final net mass is known. For the separately labelled single-output LCA view, determine co-product shares before calculating allocated burdens; do not present the whole joint-trip burden as exclusively attributable to one species. Shared-resource service ownership is not co-product allocation.

Range method: for each active nonfinal row establish U_row from an independent representative reference campaign or a documented supplier/design envelope at the same species/state/gear and measurement scope, normalized on that reference campaign's own accepted output in the same explicitly labelled physical or LCA view as the target; never compare allocated and unallocated quantities. Retain the preselected uncertainty margin, sampling design, sample size and comparability argument; do not use the target batch maximum to check that same batch. The lower value 0 means nonnegative physical amounts, not permission to fill missing data with zero. No numeric U is invented here. When an independent envelope is unavailable, the data producer records a range-evidence gap and seeks measurement; it cannot declare a quantitative guardrail pass. Out-of-envelope measurements are retained and investigated. The final 1-to-1 range follows only from the reference definition.

Apply lot_attribution to every nonfinal row: retain raw collected values separately from allocated/normalized calculated exchanges. Derive fossil CO2 from actual fuel composition and an independently evidenced emission method, or measured release records, before attribution/final-mass normalization; method parameters require compatible composition/oxidation/measurement evidence.

### Calculation Rules

| rule_id | Applies to | Formula or rule | Inputs | Output | source_ids |
| --- | --- | --- | --- | --- | --- |
| `lot_attribution` | all inventory rows | Keep two explicitly labelled views. First reconcile unallocated physical receipts, transfers, products, losses and stocks for the complete declared cohort/trip/run; pair internal transfers in the same state and unit, retaining their measured mass. Assign shared resource/service events to actual consuming nodes and periods once using evidenced service shares, without shrinking product, biomass, water or waste partitions by a co-product share. Divide this physical inventory by the matching positive accepted final net kg. Separately derive a labelled single-output LCA burden/inventory projection using section 7 co-product allocation exactly once, retaining the unallocated inventory and allocation matrix. Never test allocated exchanges against an unallocated physical balance, apply output shares again downstream, or set an internal quantity to the final 1 kg. | Node protocols; allocation ledger; accepted final net mass; stock history | Attributed exchange per 1 kg reference flow | `wild-crab-foreground-method` |
| `reference_envelope` | all nonfinal row ranges | Establish U_row separately for each actual instantiated identity/state, node and pre_sort/post_sort pass. Use the maximum normalized amount of an independent representative reference campaign times a predeclared uncertainty margin not less than 1, or a supplier design envelope in matching numerator unit and final-net-kg basis times that margin; retain raw quantities, reference net kg, sample size, scope and margin rationale. Exclude the target lot from its own envelope and never pool different substances under one collection scope bound. Without independent evidence the instance remains uninstantiated, not numerically QA-cleared or a complete quantitative data package. | Independent campaign records; scope; uncertainty margin | U_row | `wild-crab-foreground-method` |
| `conditional_interface_envelopes` | capture_internal_water_ice_transfer_water; capture_internal_water_ice_transfer_ice; grading_internal_water_ice_receipt_water; grading_internal_water_ice_receipt_ice; grading_internal_water_ice_transfer_water; grading_internal_water_ice_transfer_ice; live_hold_internal_water_ice_receipt_water; live_hold_internal_water_ice_receipt_ice; live_hold_internal_water_ice_transfer_water; live_hold_internal_water_ice_transfer_ice; fresh_chill_internal_water_ice_receipt_water; fresh_chill_internal_water_ice_receipt_ice; fresh_chill_internal_water_ice_transfer_water; fresh_chill_internal_water_ice_transfer_ice; presentation_internal_water_ice_receipt_water; presentation_internal_water_ice_receipt_ice; dq_complete_presentation_actual_source_water; presentation_internal_water_ice_transfer_water; presentation_internal_water_ice_transfer_ice; presentation_water_ice_handover_water; presentation_water_ice_handover_ice; presentation_packaging_handover | For each listed atomic card, or each actual exchange required by a listed collection obligation, instantiate actual identity, state, node, pass and numerator unit before establishing U_row from the same-view normalized maximum of an independent representative campaign times a predeclared margin at least 1, or a matching-unit/basis supplier design envelope. Retain samples, source, basis and uncertainty; never use the target batch to establish its own upper bound. Unverified service unit/support or absent independent envelope remains an unresolved instance, not numeric QA-cleared or zero. Reconcile physical water/ice/packaging movements separately from service-share quantities. | independent reference records; actual unit and basis | U_row | `wild-crab-foreground-method` |

### Data Quality Requirements

| requirement_id | Applies to | Requirement | Evidence |
| --- | --- | --- | --- |
| `quality_scope` | reference lot | Trace wild origin, species/gear/habitat, actual food/body/life state and the first gate; do not average incompatible states or infer unknown viability. | Capture, grading, state acceptance and dispatch records |
| `quality_amounts` | all actual exchanges | Use representative temporal coverage including unsuccessful effort, measurement uncertainty and supplier scope; classify missing identity/amount/range evidence as gaps, not zero. | Calibrations, supplier/detail records and independent reference-campaign logs |
| `quality_impact` | capture and release | Retain bycatch, injury, delayed-fate uncertainty, lost gear, ghost-fishing and habitat-contact observations even when characterization lacks coverage; never report an unassessed impact as no impact. | Observer/operator records and explicit assessment limits |
| `dq_inventory_completion` | all inventory-completion requirements | Create a separate card for every actual physical or chemical exchange, with process, direction, flow type, its own measured quantity, native unit, final-reference normalization, applicability, destination, UUID and independent range evidence. Never copy a family total, a grouped screening range or one UUID onto every child. Use not_applicable only for evidenced absence; unknown is not zero. Any unfulfilled applicable obligation makes the final dataset incomplete and fails validation. | per-flow coverage ledger, raw measurements, identity, fate and range evidence |
| `dq_complete_capture_fuel` | `capture`; inputs; product | Identify and separately collect every actual exchange covered by “Actual fuel supplied for owned capture operations”; retain all following collection, quantity and normalization obligations: Collect fuel by grade, provider and storage reconciliation, including actual vessel/generator/mobile equipment use; exclude fuel already embodied in a purchased operated service.

This collection obligation records measured material mass and attributed replacement only, never invented kg converted from hours, trips or operated services; actual asset/service activity retains its native unit in the auxiliary ledger, and service datasets are instantiated separately in that actual unit. Fishing gear is recorded once in capture_gear, never again in capture_materials_assets. Asset events carry service life, use records and salvage destination; an operated service cannot be duplicated by its embedded materials or fuel.

| `dq_complete_capture_bait` | `capture`; inputs; product | Identify and separately collect every actual exchange covered by “Actual bait at deployment gate, species and preservation state specified”; retain all following collection, quantity and normalization obligations: Pot/trap, line or other actually baited gear only. Record purchased whole bait fish, fishery co-product or manufactured bait as distinct supplier inputs with upstream production/recovery and preservation burdens. Fresh, frozen and formulated bait are not interchangeable identities. Own-caught bait is an independently inventoried capture output/input transfer with effort, not a free withdrawal or a second purchase.

| `dq_atomic_card_identity` | all inventory rows | Each card represents one physically identified exchange, not a collection or selector. Keep Electricity as one electrical-energy flow; supplier, geography and voltage remain actual collected qualifiers, not grounds for speculative splitting. Other actual materials, waste streams, carbon origins and receiving media must have separate identities and atomic cards before completion. Preserve every existing collection obligation; an absent card or unresolved identity never means zero or a waived exchange. Paired internal water transfers retain the same actual quality, transfer id, quantity and upstream burden, without another purchase. | Per-card identity, provider, state, destination and paired records |
| `dq_atomic_range_evidence` | repaired atomic flow cards | U_row is an unresolved evidence requirement, not a numerical estimate, default, clipping limit or completeness pass. Establish each card's own matching-unit/reference-basis upper envelope from independent representative records or a compatible documented supplier/design bound, retaining scope, method and uncertainty. Do not reuse a removed aggregate range, copy a sibling quantity, derive a bound from the target batch itself or invent a value. Applicable missing evidence blocks quantitative QA completion; actual measurements remain required. | Independent envelope evidence; retained raw records and uncertainty |

## 9. Validation Rules

| rule_id | Applies to | Rule | source_ids |
| --- | --- | --- | --- |
| `validate_identity` | reference lot | Verify wild provenance, actual species/habitat, whole-body/native-shell and appendage condition, shell/molt and food grade, actual live/fresh/chilled state and the first gate. Refuse detached parts, cooked/frozen meat and managed-growth/molt lots. Missing actual state/gate or food acceptance blocks the final reference, not an assumed live/default route. | `wild-crab-foreground-method` |
| `validate_balance` | all nodes | Check species/state-specific opening stock + receipts = accepted transfers + other intended outputs + actual losses/releases + closing stock, adjusted only for separately measured water or material changes. Pair internal transfers once and require nonnegative exchanges. A 1 kg final denominator does not fix upstream catch or live intake to 1 kg. | `wild-crab-foreground-method` |
| `validate_technology` | capture | Reconcile gear deployed/retrieved/lost/recovered and bait charged/retrieved/consumed/remaining by deployment. Preserve observed ghost-fishing, entanglement, bottom contact and unknown fate outside mere mass totals. Confirm every claimed non-pot delta using actual method-specific effort, catch and impact records; no borrowed stock-status, sustainable-fishery or universal no-habitat-effect claim. | `wild-crab-foreground-method` |
| `validate_hold_state` | live_hold; fresh_chill; presentation | Live survivors, eligible fresh diversions and nonqualifying mortality are disjoint. Fresh diversion requires separately documented actual death/handling history and lawful acceptance; unknown deaths remain a gap or reject. Check node activation, before/after states, lot time and bypass transfer equivalence. Neither zero-duration holding nor unobserved feed/gas/effluent may be inferred from missing logs. | `wild-crab-foreground-method` |
| `validate_ranges` | all cards | For supplied nonfinal Ranges verify the same numerator unit per 1 kg reference flow and independent U_row evidence under reference_envelope. Cards without Ranges record an unresolved independent range-evidence need, not a claim that a protocol-derived interval already exists. Before numerical QA establish the instance envelope from a separate representative campaign or supplier evidence, retaining scope, sample size and uncertainty; absent evidence is a gap, never QA-cleared, a default quantity or zero. Preserve and investigate real outliers without clipping. Final 1..1 kg is reference normalization only. | `wild-crab-foreground-method` |
| `validate_ownership` | all nodes | Check all intended outputs/handoffs, failed-trip burden, stock carryover, shared-node/period shares and packaging returns. One physical fuel, water, operating-service or asset event has one burden owner; upstream supplier burdens and actual direct releases cannot be omitted or duplicated. Check material and water ledgers separately from pollutant/species ledgers. | `wild-crab-foreground-method` |
| `validate_binding` | all exchanges | Resolve each actual exchange to a separately confirmed concrete identity, property, unit and relevant geography/state/compartment before downstream process publication. Conditional collection obligations in Section 8 may instantiate multiple actual substances/materials, never a fixed generic UUID. Exact fixed electricity/ice/CO2 cards apply only to their declared conditions; quantity factors require independent evidence. Identity and measurement validation do not certify food safety or fishery sustainability. | `wild-crab-foreground-method` |
| `validate_secondary_bait` | capture_bait | Check prior system, recovery/supply handoffs, actual composition/state, inheritance/cut-off decision and duplicate burdens. Missing supplier evidence remains a gap; do not import experimental catch efficiency, sustainability assertions or negative-carbon credit. | `cerbule-secondary-bait-2023`; `wild-crab-foreground-method` |
| `validate_inventory_completion` | all concrete exchanges and section 8 completion obligations | Verify each applicable dq_complete obligation has separately measured and identity-verified exchange cards. Check each quantity, native unit, range evidence, normalization, receiving medium, destination and non-duplication. Any unfulfilled actual child exchange, quantity, identity or destination makes the final dataset incomplete and fails validation; unknown cannot be zero. Static PCR checking does not replace this evidence. |  |
