# Wild freshwater fish, live, fresh or chilled

## 1. Scope and Applicability

This PCR covers wild freshwater finfish for human consumption, delivered whole and unprocessed as one actual live, fresh or chilled lot at the first landing handover. A dataset declares its species, freshwater habitat and wild-capture origin; an inland brackish or marine fishery is not automatically freshwater. Short preservation does not make the fish farmed. Exclude farmed fish, ornamental fish, seed/bait/nonfood outputs, wild Salmonidae, frozen fish, fillets, separated liver/roe and other processed products. The UN CPC 3.0 notes distinguish the neighbouring farmed, ornamental, nonfood, wild Salmonidae, frozen and specified processed-product categories (`un-cpc3-notes`). Separately, this PCR deliberately selects the narrower boundary of whole unprocessed fish captured from declared freshwater waterbodies and delivered at first landing. The CPC fish-product category does not itself establish that freshwater species must be caught only in freshwater, or that every headed/gutted non-fillet product is excluded.

The route is capture, actual preservation when performed, and first landing presentation/handover. Live maintenance and chilled preservation are mutually exclusive for a reference lot; immediate fresh landing may bypass preservation only with actual records. Unknown state, water origin or handover location is a data gap, not a default route. No cross-species edible service, processing yield, regulatory authorization or universal fishery performance is supplied.

## 3. Reference Flow

| Field | Value |
| --- | --- |
| What | Whole wild freshwater food fish at first landing handover |
| How much | 1 kg |
| How well | Accepted whole unprocessed fish of declared species/grade and one actual live, fresh or chilled state; recorded live viability or actual time-temperature/acceptance observations |
| How long or cycle | Named fishing trip or campaign and landing lot; shared gear and vessel service linked to their actual service periods, replacement and retirement events |
| reference_flow_link | `freshwater_landing_product` |

| Field | Value |
| --- | --- |
| Reference amount | 1 |
| Reference product flow | Wild freshwater fish, live, fresh or chilled `71a18b97-ce6e-4a8d-adab-159854459ca8` |
| Reference flow property | Mass `93a60a56-a3c8-11da-a746-0800200b9a66` |
| Reference unit group | Units of mass `93a60a57-a4c8-11da-a746-0800200c9a66` |
| Reference unit | kg |
| Required qualifiers | wild origin; species; freshwater waterbody and capture location; trip/gear; landing time/location; actual live/fresh/chilled state; whole condition; landed grade; net biomass method; accepted lot and first handover; reporting period; actual preservation route |

The same first landing handover is used for every state. Holding on board or at the landing site is inside the boundary; distribution to a processor, consolidator elsewhere, retailer or consumer is outside it. No optional-output selector is needed: `freshwater_landing_product` is always the sole actual final output. Tare or separately drain/weigh water, ice and containers with a documented method that preserves the declared live state.

## 4. Measurement and Unit Rules

| rule_id | Applies to | Required property | Required unit | Rule |
| --- | --- | --- | --- | --- |
| reference_mass | reference product | Mass `93a60a56-a3c8-11da-a746-0800200b9a66` | kg | Weigh accepted net whole-fish biomass on a calibrated scale; exclude carrier water, ice and containers; retain gross, tare and handling records. |
| internal_mass | whole_catch; landing_catch; preserved_whole_lot; dispatch_lot | Mass `93a60a56-a3c8-11da-a746-0800200b9a66` | kg | Measure each actual internal lot transfer and reconcile both ends on the same state/time basis. Normalize measured transfers per 1 kg reference flow; do not fix internal transfers to 1 kg. |
| water_mass | supplied_process_water; direct_freshwater_withdrawal; effluent_to_treatment; direct_water_return; dispatch_supplied_water | Mass `93a60a56-a3c8-11da-a746-0800200b9a66` | kg | Use mass records; volume-only meters require a recorded water state and density conversion with uncertainty. Keep supply, abstraction, recirculation, treatment and direct return separate. |
| electricity_conversion | cn_low_voltage_electricity; other_capture_electricity; other_preservation_electricity | Net calorific value `93a60a56-a3c8-11da-a746-0800200c9a66` | kWh | Record electrical energy in kWh with 3.6 MJ/kWh conversion in Units of energy 93a60a57-a3c8-11da-a746-0800200c9a66.

## 5. System Boundary

### Boundary Abstraction

| Field | Value |
| --- | --- |
| declared_starting_condition | Wild fish population in a declared natural freshwater waterbody, prior to capture; capture biomass removal and actual resources are recorded |
| starting_condition_role | Natural resource starting context, followed by measured capture; not managed aquaculture or a burden-free fish purchase |
| product_classification_scope | Semantic wild freshwater whole-food-fish category, linked to CPC 3.0 04211 without treating its classification as the route definition |
| recursive_input_rule | If previously landed whole fish are purchased for additional handling, retain supplier capture/landing burdens once and declare the extended gate. Do not relabel that purchase as new local capture or use this first-landing output without matched boundary evidence. |
| upstream_dataset_requirement | Matched supply datasets for fuels, bait, gear, water, electricity, ice, oxygen, materials and assets; origin-enhanced/stocked fisheries disclose and investigate attributable upstream stocking rather than assigning zero automatically |
| disclosure | Species, habitat, wild/stocked provenance, gear and habitat interaction, vessel/manual mode, periods, shared assets, bycatch releases, actual preservation and gate, emissions and water accounting, exclusions and missing impact characterization |

### Boundary Rules

| rule_id | Applies to | Rule | source_ids |
| --- | --- | --- | --- |
| boundary_capture | inland_capture | Include biomass removal, fishing effort, fuel combustion, bait, material/gear replacement, co-catch, actual losses and trip return to first landing. Capture removes natural fish; preservation only stabilizes an already collected product. | fao-inland-fisheries |
| boundary_preservation | landing_preservation | Include actual on-board and landing live maintenance or chilling before handover. Record usable state before and after intervention, its resources, losses and handover to dispatch. Immediate fresh landing can bypass only on evidence. | fao-fish-handling; fao-live-transport |
| boundary_ice | supplied_chilling_ice; supplied_process_water; cn_low_voltage_electricity; other_preservation_energy | For purchased ice include matched supplier production once. For on-site ice include its actual water, energy, equipment and refrigerant burdens here, keep the internal ice production/use ledger and exclude a second purchased-ice burden for that amount. | fao-fish-handling |
| boundary_dispatch | landing_dispatch | Include presentation/packing actually performed before first collector/buyer handover; record pre-pack fish state, package protection roles and reusable-container status. Exclude subsequent distribution, processing and cooking. |  |
| boundary_assets | capture_gear; spent_gear; dispatch_packaging; all processes | Inventory actual shared vessel, tank, ice machine, landing utilities and returnable boxes; record consuming nodes and periods, lifetime/service-use evidence, replacements and retirement. Include attributable upstream asset/service burdens through separately identified concrete exchanges and disclose justified exclusions. |  |
| boundary_environment | all processes | Track retained, released, escaped and dead catch; habitat interactions and lost gear; actual abstraction and discharge; combustion and refrigerant emissions. Species/population and gear-impact records accompany the LCI. A resource-flow exchange alone does not characterize biodiversity, depletion or habitat impact; disclose LCIA method coverage and gaps. | fao-inland-fisheries |

## 6. Process Inventory Structure

### Process Map

| process_id | process_name | inclusion | inclusion_condition | role | quantitative_reference |
| --- | --- | --- | --- | --- | --- |
| inland_capture | Inland capture | required | Actual wild freshwater capture, vessel or non-vessel | Remove wild biomass and deliver measured retained whole catch | Measured lot resources per 1 kg reference flow |
| landing_preservation | Actual preservation before landing handover | conditional | Evidenced live maintenance or chilled intervention; bypass only for immediate fresh landing without intervention | Stabilize retained whole fish before the same first landing handover | Measured incoming and outgoing biomass per 1 kg reference flow |
| landing_dispatch | First landing presentation and handover | required | Every reference lot; packaging inputs only when actual packing occurs | Accept the actual whole-fish lot and hand to the first buyer at landing | 1 kg reference flow |

Trips are batch/campaign records. For continuous landing operations, define a closed reporting period and matched lot ledger. Link cleaning, ice production, changeover and standby resources to actual consuming lots/periods. Each applicable Section 8 collection obligation requires zero, one or multiple independent atomic exchanges according to evidenced actual occurrence; the obligation itself is not a flow or a final TIDAS identity.

All nonfinal Range blocks are broad provisional author screening estimates, not empirical values or permitted limits. Upper screens deliberately allow low-yield trips, loss-heavy lots and widely varying holding times: 100 kg for biomass/materials, 1,000 kg for fuel/other carrier or pollutant screens, 100,000 kg for water, 10,000 kWh for powered preservation and 10,000 kg for fossil CO2. They do not establish normal practice; investigate outliers and retain actual observations without truncation. Replace them with lot- and route-supported evidence when available. The final 1–1 kg range follows the reference definition (`net-mass-reference-definition`).

### Process: Inland capture (`inland_capture`)

#### Inputs

##### Product flows

###### Diesel for freshwater fishing vessel (`capture_diesel`)

Include only diesel actually burned by the inland fishing vessel, with engine and trip records. Shore or manual fishing may have no vessel fuel.

Conditional identity: this flow represents only actual diesel combustion by a freshwater fishing vessel in the capture role, supported by vessel/engine and freshwater trip records. It does not identify marine-vessel, shore pump, road transport, farm or other diesel use; those require independently matched identities and quantities.

###### Actual capture electricity supply (`other_capture_electricity`)

Record purchased electricity for an actual shore-based or electric-vessel capture operation, with supplier geography, voltage and meter. This is electrical energy, independently accounted from fuel mass; the China landing-preservation identity is not automatically a capture match.

##### Elementary flows

###### Fossil carbon dioxide emitted to air (`capture_fossil_co2`)

Include actual on-vessel combustion emissions, separate from upstream fuel supply. The fixed identity is immediate fossil CO2 to unspecified air, used only where no finer air subcompartment is reported; an actually specified compartment requires independently verified matching identity. Use measured fossil carbon or a traceable engine/fuel-specific factor; disclose oxidation and biogenic fraction, with no default emission factor.

### Process: Actual preservation before landing handover (`landing_preservation`)

#### Inputs

###### Externally supplied treated process water (`supplied_process_water`)

Conditional on an external treated water supply suitable for actual fish handling, live holding, cleaning or on-site ice making. Keep use-specific metering and supplier quality evidence; no direct freshwater abstraction or repeat recirculation quantity.

This is one actual externally supplied water exchange, not an assumed industrial process-water supply. Retain its measured quantity and actual source, treatment, grade, salinity and use. Verify fitness for the actual animal-contact, carrier, washing or ice-making purpose and resolve the exact actual supply identity independently before dataset completion; no industrial-water UUID is inherited.

###### China low-voltage grid electricity to user (`cn_low_voltage_electricity`)

Use only for an actual Chinese supply below 1 kV with grid-average consumption mix. Meter live aeration, refrigeration, on-site ice and cleaning shares; this card does not impose a Chinese geography on the product category.

Conditional identity: this binding applies only to actual purchased Chinese grid-average consumption-mix alternating current below 1 kV delivered to this node. Verify geography, voltage, supplier/mix and actual consumption; other regions, voltages, contracted mixes or own generation require independent identities and records. No supply or use is assumed.

### Process: First landing presentation and handover (`landing_dispatch`)

#### Inputs

###### New externally supplied carrier or cleaning water at dispatch (`dispatch_supplied_water`)

Record only newly supplied treated water suitable for the actual use. Water already received and accounted within preservation is carried in the water ledger, not purchased a second time; carrier water does not enter net fish biomass.

This is one actual externally supplied water exchange, not an assumed industrial process-water supply. Retain its measured quantity and actual source, treatment, grade, salinity and use. Verify fitness for the actual animal-contact, carrier, washing or ice-making purpose and resolve the exact actual supply identity independently before dataset completion; no industrial-water UUID is inherited.

## 7. Allocation and Co-product Handling

| rule_id | Applies to | Rule | source_ids |
| --- | --- | --- | --- |
| allocation_subdivision | all processes | Separate species/grade lots and independently metered activities first. Assign directly traceable resource use and quality losses to their actual lot; enumerate every saleable retained species/grade and its first handover. | ghg-product-allocation |
| allocation_residual | shared trip and landing burdens | For indivisible residual burdens use evidenced causal shares when a defensible relation is demonstrated. Otherwise disclose economic shares based on contemporaneous landed species/grade revenue, reporting all output quantities, prices and sensitivity. Shares across consuming outputs sum to one; no universal allocation fraction is supplied. | ghg-product-allocation |
| allocation_losses | all catch and waste | Include resources consumed before mortality/rejection in the successful and other intended outputs' burden accounting. Give no substitution credit to released, escaped or discarded fish. Only actual lawful sales are co-products; internal transfers cancel across nodes and receive no sale credit. |  |
| allocation_period | assets and all processes | Identify construction/service, maintenance/replacement and retirement phases and actual trips/reporting periods. Allocate actual gear, vessel, ice machine, holding-tank and box service by documented usage/lifetime; retain opening/closing stock, replacement and termination evidence. Do not charge the same replacement in multiple periods. |  |
| allocation_shared | shared infrastructure and services | List each actual shared asset/service with all consuming nodes/lots and periods; assign metered use or evidenced service shares once. Record unused/standby and cleaning/changeover treatment. Account once for the same ice supply, fuel combustion, water, tank or container burden across nodes. |  |

## 9. Validation Rules

| rule_id | Applies to | Rule | source_ids |
| --- | --- | --- | --- |
| validate_scope | reference product | Require wild freshwater food species and whole unprocessed actual live/fresh/chilled state; reject excluded farmed, ornamental, Salmonidae, frozen or processed substitutions. | un-cpc3-notes |
| validate_reference | freshwater_landing_product | Require 1 kg accepted net fish and one actual first landing handover. Exclude carrier water, ice and packaging; same reference row applies to every declared state. | net-mass-reference-definition |
| validate_route | process map and transfers | Require one evidenced incoming route at dispatch. Live and chilled preservation are mutually exclusive per reference lot; unknown actual state/operation blocks completion. Check actual transfer masses at both ends and bypass preservation only with immediate-fresh evidence. |  |
| validate_resources | capture and preservation | Require biomass removal, actual vessel/manual mode, complete fuel/gear/bait/utilities and attributable shared assets; no missing resource treated as zero. Separate supplied ice from on-site production and preserve actual supplier/geography/voltage identity. |  |
| validate_environment | elementary and waste cards | Require substance and receiving medium for direct emissions, actual factor/test basis, direct withdrawal/return versus supply/treatment pathways and actual waste recipients. Catch/habitat logs and method-coverage gaps must be disclosed; reject invented universal depletion or pollutant UUIDs. |  |
| validate_outputs | intended output set | Enumerate species/grade sales with handover, quantity and price, distinguish release/residue/waste, apply explicit allocation precedence and verify shares/reconciliation. One sale cannot be reported at multiple handovers; internal transfers have no output credit. |  |
| validate_periods_shared | assets and all processes | Link trips, campaign/continuous-period boundaries, cleaning/changeover, phases, replacement/retirement and all asset consumers; reject duplicate attribution of a common resource or asset across nodes/periods. |  |
| validate_measurement | all inventory rows | Require matched measurement/property/unit, per 1 kg reference flow basis, collection protocol and transparent density/energy or substance conversion where used. No unmeasured universal fish weight, yield, mortality, ice or fuel factor. |  |
| validate_bindings_ranges | all inventory rows | Confirm fixed identities against actual state, gate and support rows; expand conditional collection obligations with verified actual identities. Provisional reasoned ranges only screen records, cannot supply fabricated empirical values or truncate outliers. |  |
| `validate_inventory_completion` | all concrete exchanges and section 8 completion obligations | Verify each applicable dq_complete obligation has separately measured and identity-verified exchange cards. Check each quantity, native unit, range evidence, normalization, receiving medium, destination and non-duplication. Any unfulfilled actual child exchange, quantity, identity or destination makes the final dataset incomplete and fails validation; unknown cannot be zero. Static PCR checking does not replace this evidence. |  |

## 10. Published Dataset Profile

| Field | Value |
| --- | --- |
| dataset_role | Foreground data package for wild freshwater whole-food-fish capture through first landing handover |
| downstream_use | secondary_dataset; background_dataset; flow, process and lifecyclemodel projections only after actual concrete identities and data evidence are complete |
| allowed_use | Declared species/waterbody, actual capture gear and reporting period, one actual live/fresh/chilled state and matched first landing gate; any aggregation preserves disclosed species/state/route shares |
| excluded_use | Aquaculture; marine or brackish fish; ornamental/nonfood and Salmonidae references; processing/retail/cooking; universal fishery performance; equivalent edible service across species/states; claim of complete habitat/biodiversity assessment from resource-flow mapping alone |
| required_metadata | Reference qualifiers; trips/campaign or continuous period; co-catch/loss/release ledger; preservation branch and time/viability records; asset consumers/service periods; actual utility and material supply; gate and accepted net biomass |
| required_quality_disclosure | Data coverage and uncertainty; failed trips; allocation/period assumptions; stocked-source burden investigation; UUID gaps; provisional ranges; exhaust/water methods; actual wastes; excluded capital or direct impacts and LCIA coverage |
| update_trigger | Changed species/origin/waterbody, gear/engine, actual state/gate, preservation mode, supplier/voltage, ice origin, survival/loss, shared-asset attribution, discharge route or new measured evidence |
