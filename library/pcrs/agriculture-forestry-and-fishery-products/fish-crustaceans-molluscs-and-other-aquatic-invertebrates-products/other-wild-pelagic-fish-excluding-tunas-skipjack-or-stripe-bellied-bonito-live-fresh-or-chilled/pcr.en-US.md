# Wild whole chilled midwater-trawl Atlantic mackerel

## 1. Scope and Applicability

This PCR covers the selected US Northwest Atlantic single-vessel midwater-trawl route for Scomber scombrus supplied as whole ungutted, never-frozen chilled fish at the first harvester physical recipient. It governs foreground collection and downstream projections; it does not establish legal, food-safety or stock-status compliance. A classification leaf covers more products than this route.

NOAA supports species, geographic fishery and midwater capture. Seafish supports the single-vessel pelagic trawl mechanism, incidental bycatch and possible seabed contact. Torry Note 66 supports whole ungutted handling and ice/refrigerated-seawater mechanisms as historical UK guidance; it does not establish current US route prevalence or numerical preservation limits. Actual route, preservation and recipient evidence are required. Pair/bottom trawling, purse seine, handline, other species, farmed, gutted, headed, frozen, cooked and preserved processed reference products are excluded. No independent universal washing or primary-processing operation is assumed.

## 3. Reference Flow

| Field | Value |
| --- | --- |
| What | Accepted net whole ungutted never-frozen chilled Scomber scombrus at first harvester physical recipient |
| How much | 1 kg; A is the positive accepted net fish mass of the same selected lot |
| How well | Species, whole ungutted never-frozen chilled state and recorded recipient acceptance; actual grade, preservation and package declared without invented temperature or safety criteria |
| How long or cycle | Trip/haul/lot dates and reporting period; departure, unsuccessful searching/towing, handling, cleaning, holding, offloading and recipient acceptance; asset installation, replacement and retirement periods |
| reference_flow_link | `accepted_mackerel` |

| Field | Value |
| --- | --- |
| Reference amount | 1 |
| Reference product flow | Whole ungutted never-frozen chilled Atlantic mackerel accepted at first harvester physical recipient |
| Reference flow property | Mass `93a60a56-a3c8-11da-a746-0800200b9a66` |
| Reference unit group | Units of mass `93a60a57-a4c8-11da-a746-0800200c9a66` |
| Reference unit | kg |
| Required qualifiers | Scomber scombrus; wild; US Northwest Atlantic area/stock; single-vessel midwater-trawl route and actual contact/bycatch evidence; trip/haul/lot and reporting dates; whole ungutted/head-on; raw; never frozen; chilled; actual ice/RSW configuration; actual bulk or box/crate presentation and reusable packaging ownership; named first harvester physical recipient with location and handoff/acceptance time; accepted net fish mass and free ice/water/tare exclusion; grade/destination; intended output set and allocation/asset/service boundary |

Every qualifier must be declared in the foreground package. Bulk and presented lots retain the same whole-fish reference state; recipient acceptance is one final output. Internal transfers are measured, not fixed to one kilogram.

## 4. Measurement and Unit Rules

| rule_id | Applies to | Required property | Required unit | Rule |
| --- | --- | --- | --- | --- |
| `reference_mass` | reference product | Mass `93a60a56-a3c8-11da-a746-0800200b9a66` | kg | Use accepted whole-fish net mass A at recipient acceptance; include head and guts; exclude free ice/water and tare. Weigh on a calibrated scale with documented drainage and tare procedure, or use traceable matching recipient weights under cp_receipt. |
| `native_instances` | concrete inventory exchanges required by section 8 | Actual verified instance property | native unit | Instantiate zero, one or multiple exchanges; keep each native unit and independent U_instance. Convert count/volume/energy only with documented density, item mass or physical conversion; never sum incompatible dimensions. |
| `transfer_mass` | internal fish transfers | Mass `93a60a56-a3c8-11da-a746-0800200b9a66` | kg | Pair transfer ids and record actual net fish mass, species, state, lot, time and destination; reconcile losses and additions separately. Ecological stock removal and discard mortality are separate indicators, not a fish-body equal-mass identity. |

## 5. System Boundary

### Boundary Abstraction

| Field | Value |
| --- | --- |
| declared_starting_condition | Wild stock in declared Northwest Atlantic fishing area; equipped single vessel at departure with actual fuel, gear, preservation and asset records |
| starting_condition_role | Foreground capture starting condition; natural stock is not a purchased cultivated fish input |
| product_classification_scope | Selected Scomber scombrus route is a narrower part of its external classification leaf |
| recursive_input_rule | Pair internal fish transfers without reattaching capture burden; externally purchased fish of the same category require independently identified upstream datasets and are outside this selected harvester route unless separately governed |
| upstream_dataset_requirement | Actual fuel, ice, materials, electricity, services, gear and capital background datasets with geography/provider/technology/year and scope; full-service and direct component ownership exclusive |
| disclosure | Capture and incidental impacts; preservation and package configuration; first physical gate; all trips/periods including failed duty; asset lifetime/replacements; consuming nodes; output allocation; unresolved identities/ranges and omitted activities |

### Boundary Rules

| rule_id | Applies to | Rule | source_ids |
| --- | --- | --- | --- |
| boundary_route | capture through receipt | Include navigation/search/tows/hauls, whole sorting, actual chilling/holding, cleaning, conditional presentation, offload and any harvester-owned transfer before first physical acceptance. Capture is independent of natural production and preservation: it removes wild fish into collected-catch state; do not invent farm inputs or primary processing. | `noaa-atlantic-mackerel`; `seafish-pelagic-trawl`; `torry-mackerel-handling` |
| boundary_handoffs | sort/chill/pack/receipt | Enumerate selected product, other species, grades, sale destinations, downgraded sales, rejects and waste, with each handoff. For actual bulk RSW transfer, chilled_mackerel passes directly to receipt; packaged fish pass through pack. Unknown configuration blocks selection; no duplicate final output. | `noaa-atlantic-mackerel`; `seafish-pelagic-trawl`; `torry-mackerel-handling` |
| boundary_burdens | all nodes and shared assets | Record one owner for every fuel, electricity, cleaning, refrigerant, vessel/gear/hold/pump/shore asset and service; enumerate consumers capture/sort/chill/pack/receipt and their active periods. A purchased complete service already containing fuel, capital and direct releases excludes those components; otherwise collect all components. Onboard generated electricity is an internal transfer when owned fuel/equipment/emissions are represented. | `accepted-lot-normalization` |
| boundary_impacts | capture and all actual direct releases | Record bycatch/live-dead outcomes, sea discards, lost gear and incidental seabed contact; do not infer zero ecological impact. Biomass disposal carries actual upstream and treatment burdens, without automatic ecological or substitution credits. Direct water pollutants require measured/modelled substance, basis and medium; no generic discharge factor is prescribed. | `noaa-atlantic-mackerel`; `seafish-pelagic-trawl` |

## 6. Process Inventory Structure

Production mode is trip/haul/lot batches with time-resolved chilling and recipient lots. Nodes are responsibilities, not an assumed strict temporal separation: actual sorting and chilling may interleave. Trace transfers and burden ownership without inventing duplicated operations.

### Process Map

| process_id | process_name | inclusion | inclusion_condition | role | quantitative_reference |
| --- | --- | --- | --- | --- | --- |
| `capture` | Single-vessel midwater-trawl capture | required | required; departure, navigation, search, towing and retrieval through captured-catch handoff; unloading belongs only to receipt | Wild-stock capture and collected-catch handoff to sorting; vessel navigation included | per 1 kg reference flow |
| `sort` | Whole-catch species and destination sorting | required | required; actual sorting may interleave with icing; preserve transfer timing | Whole caught mackerel to selected chilling lot; retained other sale states and rejects separated | per 1 kg reference flow |
| `chill` | Whole ungutted chilling and onboard holding | required | required; actual ice, refrigerated seawater or documented combined configuration | Selected whole never-frozen mackerel to chilled whole handoff for presentation or bulk receipt | per 1 kg reference flow |
| `pack` | Box or crate presentation | conditional | conditional; actual box/crate presentation before first physical receipt | Whole chilled fish enclosed or presented without changing fish state; bulk route bypasses | per 1 kg reference flow |
| `receipt` | Harvester handover and first physical acceptance | required | required; first physical recipient accepts whole chilled fish | Offload/transfer and acceptance, ending at named recipient before processing or distribution | per 1 kg reference flow |

For all ranges except the final A/A identity, 0..U_row or 0..U_instance is a provisional unresolved evidence envelope, not an empirical range, default quantity or hard validation limit. Obtain a positive finite upper bound from actual records and uncertainty before finalization. Establish a separate compatible range or explicit uncertainty evidence for every concrete native-unit instance; never copy a collection-scope bound onto its components. Conditional zero means documented absence, not missing data.

###### Seawater withdrawn for actual refrigerated-seawater system (`chill_seawater`)

Conditional on direct seawater withdrawal: meter make-up and replacement water, not recirculation throughput; identify marine source and returned water separately. Purchased water is a technosphere instance under chill_resources.

Measure seawater mass directly; conversion from metered volume requires evidenced density at the same temperature and salinity, retaining raw volume, density and uncertainty. Internal circulation is not deducted again from new intake, and a treated product-water identity cannot replace this natural seawater resource.

## 7. Allocation and Co-product Handling

| rule_id | Applies to | Rule | source_ids |
| --- | --- | --- | --- |
| allocation_direct | all output sets | Subdivide and directly assign haul/node/lot-specific activity first. Identify all intended species/grades/states/destinations, their split-off and physical handoff, including frozen or other nonreference products that share upstream duty; include their measured masses without treating them as the reference. | `accepted-lot-normalization` |
| allocation_trip | residual inseparable trip capture burdens | For residual joint capture/navigation duty use relative whole retained intended-product mass at common first split-off, after excluding water/ice/tare, as the disclosed physical loading proxy. Apply the fraction before same-lot A normalization; do not allocate to discards to erase burdens. Declare why mass represents the shared duty for this trip and compare a consistent species/grade revenue allocation sensitivity; if mass is causally unsuitable, retain a review blocker and supply an evidenced trip-specific alternative rather than silently selecting it. | `accepted-lot-normalization` |
| allocation_assets | shared vessel, gear, chilling and shore assets/services across nodes and periods | Assign observed fuel/electricity by metered consuming node or engine/pump run-hours and measured load; residual shared asset service by documented service-hours over actual useful lifetime, replacements and terminal losses. Include installation, maintenance, cleaning, idle and failed trips in the declared period pool; apportion that pool to all intended productive lots, never dividing each asset's full burden into every trip. Enumerate consuming nodes/periods and prove shares sum to the pool once; test load/time alternatives when important. | `accepted-lot-normalization` |
| allocation_losses | rejects, returns, discards and package reuse | Saleable downgrades and other intended products retain assigned upstream burdens; wastes are not intended products. Retain rejection, mortality and discard management burdens on intended production with actual treatment/disposal, no unproven avoidance credit. Reusable package service includes manufacture, actual rotations/cleaning, losses and end-of-use under one owner, with return transport disclosed. | `accepted-lot-normalization` |

### Calculation Rules

| rule_id | Applies to | Formula or rule | Inputs | Output | source_ids |
| --- | --- | --- | --- | --- | --- |
| `lot_normalization` | all inventory rows | Retain the unallocated physical ledger and divide actual material transfers by positive accepted net fish mass A of that same lot. Apply evidenced allocation shares only to genuinely shared LCA burdens in the separate attribution view before dividing by A; do not scale species-specific physical fish transfers or use allocation to close mass. Final reference output is A/A = 1 kg. Preserve each numerator's native unit; aggregate compatible instances only. | cp_capture; cp_sort; cp_chill; cp_pack; cp_receipt; A | Native exchange quantity per 1 kg reference flow and separate unallocated physical ledger | `accepted-lot-normalization` |
| `direct_releases` | all direct CO2 and other release cards | Use actual measured releases or activity times an explicitly identified factor with matching substance, medium, fuel/composition and unit; document oxidation/abatement/leakage and uncertainty. Apply lot_normalization only to direct releases owned by that node, excluding purchased full-service coverage. | Node-specific protocol; measured release or activity and externally cited factor | Substance/medium-specific release per reference flow | `accepted-lot-normalization` |

### Data Quality Requirements

| requirement_id | Applies to | Requirement | Evidence |
| --- | --- | --- | --- |
| `quality_identity` | all exchanges | Verify concrete identity/property/unit/provider/gate before final exchange publication; conditional service/material/release cards require actual instances. Unresolved candidate identities are not fixed matches. | Supplier composition, scope and verified detail/support records |
| `quality_completeness` | all node/period/output records | Use the same accepted lot denominator; collect every active node and bypass evidence, failed and idle duty, grades/species/destinations, waste treatment and asset replacements; retain full-service versus component exclusions. | Transfer, output, asset and ownership ledgers with reconciliation |
| `quality_quantities` | all nonreference ranges and emissions | Resolve U_row/U_instance with actual observed/modelled bounds and uncertainty; record factor provenance and applicability. Qualitative route sources cannot justify numerical fuel/ice/emission ranges. No invented zero, numeric ice ratio, shelf-life, safety threshold or stock status. | Collection protocols, underlying records, applicable factor sources and sensitivity |
| `collect_capture_resources` | `capture`; Inputs; Product flows: Actual capture materials, assets and native-unit services | Add a separate inventory exchange for each actual physical or chemical flow; determine its identity, flow type, composition/state, native property/unit, provider or receiving medium/destination. Preserve actual unallocated quantities, raw records and normalization under the collection duties below. This requirement is not a collection exchange, an assumed zero, or permission to copy aggregate amounts, ranges or UUIDs onto its components. Conditional collection: instantiate each actual net/door/rope replacement, lubricant, vessel asset share, cleaning input, shore service or purchased electricity separately with its own identity, property and native unit. Full service versus component inventory is exclusive; replacement and lifetime records include nonproductive periods. Flow property / unit: Actual instance property / native unit of each actual instance; Amount rule: Actual owned capture_resources per 1 kg reference flow from cp_capture.; Value mode: Calculated value (`calculated_value`); Specificity: Site-specific (`site_specific`); Normalization basis: per 1 kg reference flow; Basis kind: Reference flow (`reference_flow`); Evidence kind: Calculated from collection (`calculated_from_collection`); Collection protocol: `cp_capture`; Sources: `accepted-lot-normalization` Range-evidence collection duty (not an established interval and never copied onto each concrete exchange): Range：Provisional unresolved envelope; actual records required Range role：Uncertainty range (`uncertainty_range`) Lower：0 Upper：U_instance Unit：native unit of each actual instance Basis：per 1 kg reference flow Basis kind：Reference flow (`reference_flow`) Evidence kind：Reasoned estimate (`reasoned_estimate`) | Raw measured/activity, composition, transfer/destination, supplier scope and independent range evidence; `cp_capture`; `accepted-lot-normalization` |
| `collect_wild_stock_removal` | `capture`; Inputs; Elementary flows: Actual wild biomass removal by species and fate | Add a separate inventory exchange for each actual physical or chemical flow; determine its identity, flow type, composition/state, native property/unit, provider or receiving medium/destination. Preserve actual unallocated quantities, raw records and normalization under the collection duties below. This requirement is not a collection exchange, an assumed zero, or permission to copy aggregate amounts, ranges or UUIDs onto its components. Record ecological stock removal with species, stock/area, live/dead status and mortality method from haul and observer records. Mackerel and incidental taxa are separate actual instances. Do not equate removal or discard mortality to the accepted reference mass or invent a generic fish UUID.

Preserve actual unallocated quantities, raw records and normalization under the collection duties below. This requirement is not a collection exchange, an assumed zero, or permission to copy aggregate amounts, ranges or UUIDs onto its components. Conditional: list each other species or nonreference mackerel destination intended for sale, its state and first downstream handoff. Avoid relabelling mixed catch as reference mackerel; later sorting records identify the same transfer rather than a second sale. Flow property / unit: Mass `93a60a56-a3c8-11da-a746-0800200b9a66` / kg; Amount rule: Actual owned capture_other_products per 1 kg reference flow from cp_capture.; Value mode: Calculated value (`calculated_value`); Specificity: Site-specific (`site_specific`); Normalization basis: per 1 kg reference flow; Basis kind: Reference flow (`reference_flow`); Evidence kind: Calculated from collection (`calculated_from_collection`); Collection protocol: `cp_capture`; Sources: `accepted-lot-normalization` Range-evidence collection duty (not an established interval and never copied onto each concrete exchange): Range：Provisional unresolved envelope; actual records required Range role：Uncertainty range (`uncertainty_range`) Lower：0 Upper：U_instance Unit：kg Basis：per 1 kg reference flow Basis kind：Reference flow (`reference_flow`) Evidence kind：Reasoned estimate (`reasoned_estimate`) | Raw measured/activity, composition, transfer/destination, supplier scope and independent range evidence; `cp_capture`; `accepted-lot-normalization` |

Preserve actual unallocated quantities, raw records and normalization under the collection duties below. This requirement is not a collection exchange, an assumed zero, or permission to copy aggregate amounts, ranges or UUIDs onto its components. Conditional: separate retained waste to treatment, sea discards by species/live status, lost gear and oily waste. Stock removal and sea-discard fate are linked ecological records of one event, not two independent resource-removal exchanges. Record each destination and native quantity; sea discards are not automatically elementary pollutant emissions or a substitution credit. Document incidental seabed contact and protected-species interactions separately. Flow property / unit: Actual instance property / native unit of each actual instance; Amount rule: Actual owned capture_discard_waste per 1 kg reference flow from cp_capture.; Value mode: Calculated value (`calculated_value`); Specificity: Site-specific (`site_specific`); Normalization basis: per 1 kg reference flow; Basis kind: Reference flow (`reference_flow`); Evidence kind: Calculated from collection (`calculated_from_collection`); Collection protocol: `cp_capture`; Sources: `accepted-lot-normalization` Range-evidence collection duty (not an established interval and never copied onto each concrete exchange): Range：Provisional unresolved envelope; actual records required Range role：Uncertainty range (`uncertainty_range`) Lower：0 Upper：U_instance Unit：native unit of each actual instance Basis：per 1 kg reference flow Basis kind：Reference flow (`reference_flow`) Evidence kind：Reasoned estimate (`reasoned_estimate`) | Raw measured/activity, composition, transfer/destination, supplier scope and independent range evidence; `cp_capture`; `accepted-lot-normalization` |

Preserve actual unallocated quantities, raw records and normalization under the collection duties below. This requirement is not a collection exchange, an assumed zero, or permission to copy aggregate amounts, ranges or UUIDs onto its components. Conditional collection: instantiate each actual combustion pollutant including actual biogenic CO2, refrigerant leakage, oily discharge or cleaning/water pollutant owned by capture; retain substance/speciation, mass or native basis, air/water/soil compartment, method and factor source. Explicitly exclude fossil CO2 in capture_co2, other nodes and releases already covered by full services; uncharacterized biomass/water is not a pollutant UUID. Flow property / unit: Actual instance property / native unit of each actual instance; Amount rule: Actual owned capture_other_releases per 1 kg reference flow from cp_capture.; Value mode: Calculated value (`calculated_value`); Specificity: Site-specific (`site_specific`); Normalization basis: per 1 kg reference flow; Basis kind: Reference flow (`reference_flow`); Evidence kind: Calculated from collection (`calculated_from_collection`); Collection protocol: `cp_capture`; Sources: `accepted-lot-normalization` Range-evidence collection duty (not an established interval and never copied onto each concrete exchange): Range：Provisional unresolved envelope; actual records required Range role：Uncertainty range (`uncertainty_range`) Lower：0 Upper：U_instance Unit：native unit of each actual instance Basis：per 1 kg reference flow Basis kind：Reference flow (`reference_flow`) Evidence kind：Reasoned estimate (`reasoned_estimate`) | Raw measured/activity, composition, transfer/destination, supplier scope and independent range evidence; `cp_capture`; `accepted-lot-normalization` |

Preserve actual unallocated quantities, raw records and normalization under the collection duties below. This requirement is not a collection exchange, an assumed zero, or permission to copy aggregate amounts, ranges or UUIDs onto its components. Conditional: pair the capture_other_products transfer only for other retained species or nonreference whole mackerel that actually enter this sorting node; record each species/state/destination and actual mass separately. Retained products handed directly elsewhere bypass this input. A paired sorting transfer is not a second sale or duplicate capture burden. Flow property / unit: Mass `93a60a56-a3c8-11da-a746-0800200b9a66` / kg; Amount rule: Actual owned sort_other_catch per 1 kg reference flow from cp_sort.; Value mode: Calculated value (`calculated_value`); Specificity: Site-specific (`site_specific`); Normalization basis: per 1 kg reference flow; Basis kind: Reference flow (`reference_flow`); Evidence kind: Calculated from collection (`calculated_from_collection`); Collection protocol: `cp_sort`; Sources: `accepted-lot-normalization` Range-evidence collection duty (not an established interval and never copied onto each concrete exchange): Range：Provisional unresolved envelope; actual records required Range role：Uncertainty range (`uncertainty_range`) Lower：0 Upper：U_instance Unit：kg Basis：per 1 kg reference flow Basis kind：Reference flow (`reference_flow`) Evidence kind：Reasoned estimate (`reasoned_estimate`) | Raw measured/activity, composition, transfer/destination, supplier scope and independent range evidence; `cp_sort`; `accepted-lot-normalization` |

Conditional collection: instantiate each actual purchased electricity, direct fuel, lubricant, cleaning material, equipment share or complete service used by sort, with independent identity, property and native unit. Declare component or full-service ownership; fuel/equipment/emissions-owned onboard electricity is an internal transfer. Include idle, cleaning and failed duty and all actual consuming periods. Flow property / unit: Actual instance property / native unit of each actual instance; Amount rule: Actual owned sort_resources per 1 kg reference flow from cp_sort.; Value mode: Calculated value (`calculated_value`); Specificity: Site-specific (`site_specific`); Normalization basis: per 1 kg reference flow; Basis kind: Reference flow (`reference_flow`); Evidence kind: Calculated from collection (`calculated_from_collection`); Collection protocol: `cp_sort`; Sources: `accepted-lot-normalization` Range-evidence collection duty (not an established interval and never copied onto each concrete exchange): Range：Provisional unresolved envelope; actual records required Range role：Uncertainty range (`uncertainty_range`) Lower：0 Upper：U_instance Unit：native unit of each actual instance Basis：per 1 kg reference flow Basis kind：Reference flow (`reference_flow`) Evidence kind：Reasoned estimate (`reasoned_estimate`) | Raw measured/activity, composition, transfer/destination, supplier scope and independent range evidence; `cp_sort`; `accepted-lot-normalization` |

## 9. Validation Rules

| rule_id | Applies to | Rule | source_ids |
| --- | --- | --- | --- |
| validation_scope | reference product and route | Require all qualifiers and proof of species/area/single-vessel midwater gear, whole ungutted never-frozen chilled state and actual first physical recipient acceptance; reject out-of-scope reference states or unknown preservation/package configuration. | `noaa-atlantic-mackerel`; `seafish-pelagic-trawl`; `torry-mackerel-handling` |
| validation_balance | all transfers and outputs | Check actual internal mass and paired handoffs; enumerate every intended grade/species/destination, rejects and wastes. Exactly one accepted_mackerel final exchange per lot; bulk bypass must not also count pack. Do not force ecological stock removal/discard mortality to equal accepted body mass. | `accepted-lot-normalization` |
| validation_ownership | all nodes, services, direct releases and periods | Verify one owner and complete consumers/periods for each shared burden, full-service exclusions, asset replacement/lifetime, failed/idle duty and all actual combustion/leakage releases. Direct CO2 cards and other-release instances must be mutually exclusive; all release substances, receiving media and factors need evidence. | `accepted-lot-normalization` |
| validation_limits | candidate identities, quantities and automated checks | Disclose actual native-unit instances, U bounds and allocation evidence. Final exchange/dataset claims require verified flow UUIDs and support identities and all other required evidence. A structural checker pass does not prove identity, current practices, numerical ranges or complete environmental characterization. | `accepted-lot-normalization` |
| `validate_atomic_completion` | all applicable collection requirements and concrete inventory exchanges | Resolve every applicable section-8 collection requirement into individual physical/chemical exchanges with their own quantities, native units, composition/state, range basis or explicit uncertainty evidence, raw records, normalization, actual destinations/receiving media and verified compatible UUIDs. Any unresolved applicable requirement makes the final dataset incomplete and validation fails; unknown is not zero. Never copy aggregate amounts onto components or duplicate inclusive services with owned fuel/electricity/direct releases. Internal transfers are not fixed to the final 1 kg. | |
