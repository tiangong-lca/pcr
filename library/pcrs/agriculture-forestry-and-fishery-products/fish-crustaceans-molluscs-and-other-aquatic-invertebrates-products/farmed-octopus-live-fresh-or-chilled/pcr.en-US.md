# Farmed live whole raft-cage common octopus

## 1. Scope and Applicability

This PCR defines foreground data production for whole live, never-frozen, nonornamental *Octopus vulgaris* obtained as small wild creel-caught animals and subsequently grown under managed feeding in sex-separated cages with PVC dens suspended from a shared mussel raft. The route evidence is the Ría de Vigo, Galicia experiment reported by Chapela et al. (2006). An application must demonstrate this origin and managed ongrowth and document its own final nonreturn collection, grading, bounded holding or evidenced bypass, protective live presentation and all movements through the first physical recipient. A payer, invoice or change of ownership does not establish physical receipt.

The study's animals removed for SCUBA sample weighing were returned to their cages. Those events are management loops, not final harvests or sales. Its winter and summer cohorts, spawning, mortality and late failures constrain interpretation; the first 75-day analytical subset is not an inventory boundary. The paper's viability discussion establishes neither present commercial success nor current legal, welfare or safety eligibility. No animal handling technique, treatment, salinity threshold, feed ratio, cage dimension, animal size, cycle duration or yield in the source is a PCR operating default.

## 4. Measurement and Unit Rules

| rule_id | Applies to | Required property | Required unit | Rule |
| --- | --- | --- | --- | --- |
| `reference_wet_mass` | reference product | Mass | kg | A is the positive observed accepted net whole-live animal wet mass of the same receipt lot, measured under cp_receipt. Retain mantle, arms, organs and native animal body water. Exclude free/carrier water, tare, packaging and incidentals. Record the actual noninjurious measurement method; source sample manipulation is not prescribed. |
| `native_quantity` | all inventory rows | Native declared property | Native declared unit | Preserve each instance's physical property and unit before dividing its attributable quantity by A. Electricity exchanges retain actual kWh, fuel exchanges actual kg or m3 and heat exchanges actual MJ when those are the verified native units. Auxiliary energy accounting never replaces or duplicates a fuel exchange. Hours apply only to real timed equipment/use services; all other services retain provider-defined native property/unit without conversion to hours. Freight retains actual tonne-kilometres. Count, size and condition are independent metadata; count-to-mass estimates require representative weighed live same-lot samples, sampling design and uncertainty, never a species constant. |
| `internal_transfer` | internal handoffs | Mass | kg | Pair animal, carrier/free-water, material, stock, return and package transfers by transfer id, same state and native unit at sender and receiver; measure nonfinal quantities independently. Never force an internal feed to 1 kg or subtract rejected animals without carrying their inherited burden. |
| `water_release_basis` | water and release instances | Mass | kg | Record actual seawater abstraction separately from purchased water and internal circulation. Same water is not re-abstracted at each node. Pollutant mass is distinct from total water, with substance/basis/medium and measured inputs for any calculation. |

## 5. System Boundary

### Boundary Abstraction

| Field | Value |
| --- | --- |
| declared_starting_condition | Small live wild creel-origin Octopus vulgaris acquired for raft-cage ongrowth, with source/capture and transport ancestry; actual arrival quantities, losses, water and reusable transport equipment recorded |
| starting_condition_role | Biological production input with retained upstream capture and transport burdens, not burden-free wild biomass or a farmed final reference |
| product_classification_scope | Narrow live whole raft-cage-ongrown Octopus vulgaris subset of CPC 3.0 04472 |
| recursive_input_rule | Declare any received or returned same-category animal lot, its origin, stage, remaining service and inherited burdens. Stop recursive tracing only at an explicit documented upstream dataset boundary; do not recreate prior growth or erase capture ancestry. |
| upstream_dataset_requirement | Capture, acquisition logistics, feeds, utilities, materials, services, infrastructure and waste treatment require boundary-compatible supplier/foreground evidence or explicitly qualified upstream datasets. Disclose missing upstream coverage rather than assuming zero. |
| disclosure | Site and raft; origin/capture method; sex/cohort/season and actual dates; live transport; actual feed/storage/thawing; complete failures and reproductive events; final custody/receipt; holding state; all intended outputs and losses; water/package/stock transfers; shared raft/service users; allocation and uncertainty |

| rule_id | applies_to | rule | source_ids |
| --- | --- | --- | --- |
| `boundary_origin` | acquisition | Keep wild capture and source-to-raft live transport explicit, either measured here or inherited once from a verified upstream dataset. Separate initial wild animals from the later farmed output; do not claim closed hatchery ancestry. | `chapela-octopus-2006` |
| `boundary_growth` | raft_ongrowth | Include actual stocking, fresh/frozen feed purchase/storage/thawing, feeding, sex/cohort management, monitoring/sampling returns, fouling and dead-animal removal, food-remnant suction, cleaning, replacement and termination. Open-water ambient exposure is not an invented pumped-water input; actual pumps/abstraction are separately recorded. | `chapela-octopus-2006` |
| `boundary_final` | final_collection; grade_destination | Final nonreturn removal from managed cages is an independent custody change, followed by declared destination sorting. Source research returns do not prove this event. Incoming whole-live animals must reconcile to accepted live onward lots, actual alternative intended outputs, actual returns/retained stocks and actual rejects/waste with destinations. |`pcr-octopus-foreground-method` |
| `boundary_holding` | live_holding | A bounded preservation intervention after sorting is conditional on actual records with start/end, incoming usable live state, outgoing live state and its own supplies/services/losses. Evidenced bypass routes sorted animals directly to presentation. Unknown state or duration is a gap, not zero or bypass. |`pcr-octopus-foreground-method` |
| `boundary_gate` | live_presentation; prereceipt_logistics | Presentation protects the live state and keeps carrier water and reusable/single-use equipment separate from animal mass. Distribution belongs to prereceipt_logistics, including every movement before first physical receipt regardless of payer. The reference excludes later recipient operations, use and end of life; actual in-boundary waste destinations remain included. |`pcr-octopus-foreground-method` |
| `boundary_shared` | shared assets and periods | Identify the mussel raft/platform, cages, PVC dens, vessel/tanks, storage and presentation equipment, every real service consumer and service period, including other raft users. No mussel biomass input is invented solely because a raft has mussel users; its service is not free. | `chapela-octopus-2006` |
| `boundary_complete` | all nodes | Record actual active/bypass/unknown state for every conditional instance, all intended output instances, residues, mortality, escapes, water, material, packaging and elementary destinations. Reconcile periods and loops without double counting. Complete bundled services exclude covered energy/material/asset/releases from separately counted components. |`pcr-octopus-foreground-method` |

## 6. Process Inventory Structure

### Process Map

| process_id | process_name | inclusion | inclusion_condition | role | quantitative_reference |
| --- | --- | --- | --- | --- | --- |
| `acquisition` | Wild-origin acquisition and live transport to raft | required | Actual source/capture/transport scope distinguished from inherited upstream coverage | Initial animal acquisition and transport, not farmed final output | Actual acquired whole-live mass |
| `raft_ongrowth` | Managed raft-cage ongrowth and cohort management | required | Evidenced managed ongrowth of acquired animals | Batch/cohort managed biological production; sex and season indexed | Actual standing/output/stock/return quantities |
| `final_collection` | Final nonreturn collection from cages | required | Actual application final removal and custody required | Independent harvest responsibility, excluding sampling returns | Actual whole-live collected mass |
| `grade_destination` | Grade and destination sorting | required | Actual lot grading/destination decision required | Reconcile accepted live, alternative products, returns/stocks and rejects | Actual measured destination quantities |
| `live_holding` | Bounded post-sort live holding | conditional | Documented intervention with start/end; otherwise evidenced bypass; unknown remains gap | Preserve sorted live state without extending ongrowth by assumption | Actual entering/exiting live mass and duration |
| `live_presentation` | Protective live presentation | required | Actual protective presentation and material roles documented | Product/package/carrier interface, excluding logistics | Actual presented whole-live animal mass |
| `prereceipt_logistics` | All prereceipt transport and physical receipt | required | Every post-presentation leg and any earlier unowned movement recorded once | Live delivery and first physical acceptance | Positive receipt mass A |

Production is cohort/batch based. Index actual stocking windows, sex-separated cages, seasons, feed lots, sampling loops, cleaning, changeovers, failures, spawning, partial removals, opening/closing stocks and termination. These are observed dimensions, not a universal cycle. The source's 99-day winter and 83/90-day summer trials illustrate why a 75-day analysis cannot remove later burdens.

Every applicable Section 8 collection obligation resolves into zero, one or multiple actual instances with its own material/substance, state, destination, native property/unit, identity and uncertainty. A zero requires evidence of absence; unknown does not. Material cards include actual carried water/package transfers only when named in the transfer ledger. Side-product cards preserve stock and return burdens; no avoided-production credit is automatic. Carrier-native properties/units mean the verified actual electricity, fuel or heat exchange, for example Energy/kWh, Mass/kg, Volume/m3 or Energy/MJ respectively, never an automatic common-MJ replacement. Service-native properties/units mean actual provider-defined exchanges; Duration/h applies only to evidenced timed service or equipment occupancy. Other services keep their native property/unit; neither money nor another service unit silently becomes hours. Conditional carrier/service Range units follow each concrete instance, not a mixed-unit total.

Every nonfinal Range is a provisional `0..U` uncertainty envelope, not a measured cap, default quantity, permitted emission or a source-derived interval. Establish each U independently using bounded equipment/route records or independent comparable observations and retain the derivation and coverage. A batch maximum cannot validate the same batch. Unknown U blocks a numerical claim; only the final A/A normalization is fixed at 1..1. Quantities always come from collection and calculation.

Named transfer pairings are actual-route examples, not a restriction on evidenced returns. Every internally returned animal from any downstream node/period pairs with growout_return_input when returned to managed cages; every actual material/water/package/stock return pairs with the receiving real node's material-input instance. Preserve the return state, native unit, mass/quantity, transfer id and inherited burden. An outside or next-period recipient is separately identified and receives the same carryover record; do not invent an internal return when none occurs.

### Process: Wild-origin acquisition and live transport to raft (`acquisition`)

Initial small live animals remain wild-origin inputs. Record actual capture service or inherited dataset coverage, creel effort and losses, individual protection, vessel tanks/circulating seawater, transport legs and live arrival. No study transit duration or tube dimension is a default.

### Process: Protective live presentation (`live_presentation`)

The incoming state is sorted whole live octopus, either after observed holding or directly after evidenced bypass. The output remains whole live animals, protected/presented for the next actual movement. Record actual carrier water, containers/tubes, protective components and labels; establish single use, reuse, return, damage, closing stock and end-of-use destination. No package type or treatment is prescribed. Animal, package and carrier-water masses remain separate. Transport is owned by prereceipt_logistics, not hidden in presentation.

## 7. Allocation and Co-product Handling

| rule_id | applies_to | rule | source_ids |
| --- | --- | --- | --- |
| `allocation_separate` | all nodes and outputs | First subdivide independently measured activities and destinations. Enumerate all intended animal grades, alternate usable/reproductive outputs if actual, retained stocks and other raft-service users with handoffs; distinguish residues/waste and ordinary internal transfers. A transfer or monitoring return is not an extra sale. |`pcr-octopus-foreground-method` |
| `allocation_causal` | shared raft, assets and services | Attribute raft/cage/den/vessel/tank/storage/presentation service using actual causal capacity/use over the observed service period, such as evidenced occupied capacity-time. Enumerate every consuming node, cohort, season and other raft user. Document denominator, exclusions and uncertainty; no free platform or automatic mussel biomass input. Retain a single burden owner and service/component boundary. |`pcr-octopus-foreground-method` |
| `allocation_output` | inseparable intended co-products | After subdivision and an evidenced causal physical relationship, use that relationship. Only when neither is defensible use economic sensitivity fallback: comparable nonnegative producer-gate net SALES values of all intended outputs and retained stock, with a positive denominator and matched dates, currency, quality and handoff. Never use profit or net margin. Zero, negative or missing values require a justified alternative and sensitivity; do not silently assign zero or divide by an invalid denominator. |`pcr-octopus-foreground-method` |
| `allocation_period` | cohorts, stocks and assets | Include full acquisition-through-cleanup/termination periods, failures, mortality, spawning, actual feed stocks, opening/closing live stocks and later outputs. Carry prior burdens with stocks/returns; attribute asset manufacture/maintenance/replacement/end-of-service over evidenced service life and actual consuming periods. Do not erase later failure burdens by selecting an early successful interval or burden both stock and later sale twice. | `chapela-octopus-2006`; `pcr-octopus-foreground-method` |
| `allocation_losses` | mortality, residues and releases | Assign loss management and its inherited production burden to the originating cohort/output system before normalization. Recoverable intended output requires actual purpose/recipient evidence; waste receives no automatic avoided-production credit. Document actual external treatment boundaries and any separately justified scenario. |`pcr-octopus-foreground-method` |

## 8. Foreground Data Collection, Calculation, and Quality Rules

Each protocol owns one real node. Raw records use actual native units; attribution and division by the independently observed positive receipt mass A produce the stated aggregate basis. Preserve actual transfer ids, states, recipient records and service ownership even when a collection obligation requires several concrete exchanges. In every protocol, native carrier records retain actual property/unit and original reading (electricity kWh, fuel kg/m3, heat MJ only when actually applicable); native service quantity/property/unit and provider scope are mandatory, with h only for timed use. Direct release measurements retain original mass/method/calibration separately from activity/factor estimates and their observed inputs/formula/factors/sources. These mandatory raw fields and evidence requirements apply to each concrete instance; none prescribes its occurrence. A qualitative route paper is not the amount source for future collected quantities.

### Calculation Rules

| rule_id | Applies to | Formula or rule | Inputs | Output | source_ids |
| --- | --- | --- | --- | --- | --- |
| `normalize_receipt` | all inventory rows | For each instance, divide the attributable actual native-unit quantity by positive observed same-lot receipt mass A. Only live_octopus_received uses A/A = 1 kg per 1 kg reference flow. Nonfinal animal, water, package, stock and return quantities remain independently measured. | Own-node protocol; actual quantity; attribution ledger; A; cp_receipt | Native-unit exchange per 1 kg reference flow and traceable calculation |`pcr-octopus-foreground-method` |
| `energy_instance` | energy rows | Retain each actual carrier exchange in its verified native property/unit: electricity kWh, fuel kg or m3, heat MJ when applicable; normalize that exchange by A. Optional auxiliary energy accounting may use 1 kWh = 3.6 MJ or measured fuel quantity times a documented carrier-specific energy factor, with formula, factor unit/source/version, observed inputs, coverage and uncertainty. Auxiliary MJ is not a replacement or additional exchange. Never infer carrier quantities from the route paper. | Node native meter/carrier quantities; actual property/unit; optional auxiliary formula/factor/source; node protocol; A | Native-carrier exchange per 1 kg reference flow and separately labelled auxiliary energy if used |`pcr-octopus-foreground-method` |
| `release_instance` | elementary release rows | Preserve raw evidence type for each substance/receiving-medium instance. Direct measured original mass retains its method, instrument/calibration and uncertainty; only attribution and division by A are calculated, with no invented emission factor. Activity/factor or concentration/volume estimates retain observed inputs, explicit formula, compatible mass/substance basis and every factor/source actually used. Reconcile upstream/service coverage and measured retained/collected destinations; normalize once. Qualitative route, feed disappearance or gross water alone is not pollutant mass. | Direct original measured mass/method or observed activity/concentration/water plus used formula/factor/source; substance and medium; node protocol; A | Normalized release in kg per 1 kg reference flow with raw evidence type and uncertainty |`pcr-octopus-foreground-method` |
| `freight_instance` | collect_delivery_freight | Attributable actual loaded tonnes × observed distance km for each real leg, with causal shared-load and empty/return-leg treatment documented; divide by A. Preserve actual carried water/package and animal loading records; never replace freight with animal mass alone. | Leg; loaded tonnes; distance km; actual attribution and service coverage; cp_receipt; A | tkm per 1 kg reference flow |`pcr-octopus-foreground-method` |
| `stock_and_transfer` | all animal, feed, water, package and material ledgers | Reconcile opening stock plus actual receipts/production to actual outputs, returns, closing stocks, losses and measured/calculated transformation terms by period and native state/unit. Biological growth and water exchange are explicit terms, not unexplained mass creation. Pair internal transfers once; retain inherited burden in stock/return ledgers. | Own-node source/stock/transfer/destination records; count/mass/state; actual transformation evidence | Reconciled lot/period balances and burden carryover |`pcr-octopus-foreground-method` |

### Data Quality Requirements

| requirement_id | Applies to | Requirement | Evidence |
| --- | --- | --- | --- |
| `quality_identity` | all actual exchanges | Verify each concrete flow identity/property/unit against actual species/material/substance, origin, state, role, destination and gate; collection scopes are not final TIDAS exchanges. | Concrete identity confirmation, upstream scope and native-unit records |
| `quality_mass` | reference and animal transfers | Require positive independent receipt mass A; preserve whole-live wet basis, native animal water, tare/free-water exclusion and actual count/size/condition; same-lot samples retain sampling design and uncertainty. | Calibrated noninjurious actual method; physical receipt and transfer records |
| `quality_complete` | all nodes/periods | Complete full cohorts including failures, reproductive events, mortality, cleanup, replacement/termination, opening/closing stocks and all outputs/consumers; unknown states, quantities or destinations remain explicit gaps. | Period/event ledger, all intended and waste/environment destinations, service-life/user records |
| `quality_ranges` | all provisional ranges | Treat symbolic U as unestablished provisional uncertainty; obtain independent bounds and report source, comparability and coverage before numerical use. Do not use a batch's own maximum as its guardrail. | Independent bound evidence and uncertainty derivation; no source-default quantities |
| `quality_calculations` | normalized carrier/releases/services | Retain original native exchange property/unit and each actual instance's raw evidence. Direct measured releases retain mass/method/calibration; activity/factor estimates retain observed inputs, formula and used factors/sources. Auxiliary MJ never replaces/duplicates carrier exchanges; service hours apply only to timed use.

Collection scope: Actual returned water, uncollected biomass or specific substance released to its identified receiving medium before receipt. Actual prereceipt water, biomass and specific pollutants retain their receiving medium and raw evidence. <br> - Flow property / unit: Mass / kg <br> - Amount rule: Actual release divided by A; retain direct measured original mass/method separately from activity/factor estimates with measured inputs, formula and factor/source when used; retain substance/basis/medium and exclude freight/service-covered releases; cp_receipt <br> - Value mode: Calculated value (`calculated_value`) <br> - Specificity: Route-specific (`route_specific`) <br> - Normalization basis: per 1 kg reference flow <br> - Basis kind: Reference flow (`reference_flow`) <br> - Evidence kind: Calculated from collection (`calculated_from_collection`) <br> - Collection protocol: `cp_receipt` <br> - Range: Provisional prereceipt-release uncertainty <br> - Range role: Uncertainty range (`uncertainty_range`) <br> - Lower: 0 <br> - Upper: U_delivery_releases <br> - Unit: kg <br> - Basis: per 1 kg reference flow <br> - Basis kind: Reference flow (`reference_flow`) <br> - Evidence kind: Reasoned estimate (`reasoned_estimate`) | Node collection protocol, original records and individual identity, quantity, range and destination evidence |
| `dq_logistics_water_balance` | logistics, services and water/nutrient balances | Actual payload includes accompanying water, ice, packaging and other cargo. Empty return/repositioning still consumes activity: account for its actual fuel/distance/vehicle service and explicit attribution; zero cargo tonne-kilometres cannot erase that duty. Do not duplicate a complete service and covered fuel, materials, assets or direct releases. Measure external abstraction, supplied water product, internal circulation and actual returned/discharged water separately; never deduct internal recirculation again from external intake. Net nutrient increment/retention is a separate balance diagnostic, never automatically a negative elementary flow, negative emission or avoided burden. | Actual load/vehicle duty records, service scope, same-lot water/substance balance and method evidence |
| `collect_feed_fish` | `raft_ongrowth`; major feed | Independently establish the actual fish-feed species, source, composition, fresh/frozen/thawed state and as-fed moisture. When used, add an independent atomic card with its own purchases/opening/closing/offered/uneaten/loss quantity, cp_ongrowth collection, attribution and normalization by A, independent Range/uncertainty evidence and verified UUID. Major feed cannot be omitted; never copy total feed, another prey quantity or a common cap. | chapela-octopus-2006; actual supply, feeding, stock and moisture records |
| `collect_feed_crab` | `raft_ongrowth`; major feed | Independently establish the actual crab-feed species, source, composition, fresh/frozen/thawed state and as-fed moisture. When used, add an independent atomic card with its own quantity, cp_ongrowth collection and stock/offered/uneaten fate, normalization by A, independent Range/uncertainty evidence and UUID. Never copy fish, mussel or total feed quantities/caps onto crab cards. | chapela-octopus-2006; actual crab supply and feeding records |
| `collect_feed_mussel` | `raft_ongrowth`; major feed | Independently establish the actual mussel-feed species, source, whole-shell/tissue and fresh/frozen/thawed state and as-fed moisture. When used, add an independent atomic card with its own quantity, cp_ongrowth collection, shell/uneaten fate, normalization by A, independent Range/uncertainty evidence and UUID. Measure consumed mussels separately from shared mussel-raft asset service; other raft users do not automatically supply this system with feed. | chapela-octopus-2006; actual mussel supply, feeding and residue records |

## 9. Validation Rules

| rule_id | applies_to | rule | source_ids |
| --- | --- | --- | --- |
| `validate_reference` | final reference | Require exactly one final output and reference link, species/origin/managed growth/whole-live never-frozen state and first physical receipt proof, positive observed A and A/A normalization only. Dead arrivals, invoice-only gates and mantle-only mass do not satisfy the reference. |`pcr-octopus-foreground-method` |
| `validate_transfers` | every internal handoff | Match sender/receiver ids, actual lot, same state, native property/unit, quantity, custody and inherited burdens for animals, water, matter, stock, returns and packages. Check the holding branch against observed active/bypass state; unknown blocks completion. Monitoring returns are not final harvest. |`pcr-octopus-foreground-method` |
| `validate_periods` | all cohorts and services | Reconcile complete sex/cohort/season intervals, failures, spawning/eggs/fates, mortality, feed stocks, live stocks, monitoring returns, cleaning/changeovers, replacement and termination. Reject truncation at a study analytical window or duplicated stock/return burdens. | `chapela-octopus-2006`; `pcr-octopus-foreground-method` |
| `validate_destinations` | each real node | Account for every intended product/grade and actual alternative output, reject, stock, loss, waste-treatment and environment destination. Resolve zero/one/multiple conditional instances with actual records; unknown is not absence. No automatic waste credit or free shared raft. |`pcr-octopus-foreground-method` |
| `validate_allocation` | shared and inseparable outputs | Check precedence of subdivision, evidenced causal physical allocation and justified economic fallback. Include all real raft/service consumers and retained-stock values; require comparable nonnegative net sales and positive denominator, with alternatives/sensitivity for zero/negative/missing values; never profit. |`pcr-octopus-foreground-method` |
| `validate_native` | all quantities and ranges | Keep each actual carrier/service native property/unit, own-node protocol and per 1 kg reference flow basis; h only timed use, auxiliary MJ no replacement/duplicate fuel exchange. Distinguish direct measured original release mass/method from activity/factor estimates and their observed inputs/formula/used factors/sources. Provisional U is not an amount or measured cap. Complete services exclude covered components/releases. |`pcr-octopus-foreground-method` |
| `validate_readiness` | dataset handoff | A candidate methodology, structural check or literature route alone proves neither current regulatory/welfare/safety eligibility nor commercial receipt or a verified final UUID. Concrete identities, primary records, upstream coverage, qualified gaps and methodological review are required before downstream use. |`pcr-octopus-foreground-method` |
| `validate_atomic_completion` | all applicable per-flow collection obligations and final exchanges | Final dataset completion and validation require every actual exchange to have an independent atomic card and its own quantity, property/native unit, collection or calculation evidence, range/uncertainty evidence, normalization, actual destination and verified UUID. Unknown identity, activity state, quantity, range evidence or fate blocks completion; it is never zero, a presumed bypass or permission to omit an obligation. Every important concrete flow retains its own range/uncertainty evidence collection duty; a symbolic upper bound is not an empirical range. | |
