# Farmed live whole flow-through common cuttlefish

## 1. Scope and Applicability

This methodology defines foreground data production for captive-origin common cuttlefish, Sepia officinalis, following direct hatchling nursery and seawater flow-through growout, through acceptance of whole live never-frozen nonornamental animals by the first physical recipient. It is narrower than the classification leaf. It requires application records for actual delivery activities and does not assert that an experimental culture study demonstrated commercial dispatch, profitability, food-health status, welfare or legal eligibility.

Capaz et al. document Ramalhete captive eggs, live grass-shrimp nursery feed, thawed grass-shrimp growout feed, filtered/decanted seawater and aeration/shading. Their weighed animals returned to tanks; reproduction and research sampling constrain interpretation. No experimental age, body size, sex ratio, feed amount, water flow, tank size, temperature, chemical dose, cost or duration is a PCR default. These source-context facts support route decomposition only (`capaz-cuttlefish-2020`). The collection, custody and accounting requirements below are declared prospective methods (`cuttlefish-accounting-method`), not paper commerce observations.

## 3. Reference Flow

### Functional Unit

| Field | Value |
| --- | --- |
| What | Accepted whole live never-frozen farmed Sepia officinalis at first physical recipient |
| How much | 1 kg net animal wet mass; A is the same positive accepted lot mass in kg |
| How well | Actual species, captive ancestry, whole-body integrity, live and never-frozen condition, nonornamental destination, accepted grade and independent physical receipt |
| How long or cycle | Declared cohort and reporting periods covering inherited reproductive service, egg/nursery, growout, failed periods, cleaning, replacement, closing stocks, actual holding and pre-receipt custody; narrower actual nonbreeding periods require evidence |
| reference_flow_link | `live_receipt_reference` |

### Reference Flow Object

| Field | Value |
| --- | --- |
| Reference amount | 1 |
| Reference product flow | Whole live never-frozen farmed common cuttlefish at first physical recipient |
| Reference flow property | Mass `93a60a56-a3c8-11da-a746-0800200b9a66` |
| Reference unit group | Units of mass `93a60a57-a4c8-11da-a746-0800200c9a66` |
| Reference unit | kg |
| Required qualifiers | species; captive ancestry and received stage; actual location and reporting/cohort periods; direct hatchling nursery and flow-through route; live whole never-frozen state; nonornamental use; actual grade and independent count/size observations; net animal wet mass method and uncertainty; excluded carrier/free water and tare; holding active/bypass/unknown evidence; first physical recipient and every pre-receipt leg; reproductive/offspring/broodstock/stock burden ledger |

Required qualifiers must be declared in the actual data package metadata, product description, process notes or equivalent records. Missing qualifiers leave the reference incomplete. Independently establish the real product and supporting identities before final exchange use.

## 4. Measurement and Unit Rules

| rule_id | Applies to | Required property | Required unit | Rule |
| --- | --- | --- | --- | --- |
| reference_mass | reference product | Mass `93a60a56-a3c8-11da-a746-0800200b9a66` | kg | A = same-lot accepted net live whole animal wet mass in kg, independently measured at physical receipt with calibrated weighing and actual carrier/free-water and package-tare separation; native animal body water remains. Record handling and uncertainty without prescribing stressful research methods; use cp_receipt. A must be positive. |
| live_count_mass | animal transfer and stocks | Mass `93a60a56-a3c8-11da-a746-0800200b9a66` | kg | Retain independent counts, size/grade and live-condition observations. If mass is estimated from count, use representative weighed live samples of the same actual lot/state, sampling design and uncertainty; no species-average body mass or paper conversion constant. |
| native_units | all inventory rows | Actual native property | Actual native unit | Measure each exchange in its native property/unit; seawater remains Volume/m3, electricity Energy/kWh, asset service duration h and freight t.km. Preserve native amount before attribution and division by A. Never force all exchanges to Mass or use feed wet mass as nutrient mass. |
| paired_states | internal transfers and stocks | Actual native property | Actual native unit | Match output/input transfer ids, state, quantity, unit, lot, period and inherited burdens. Opening/closing stocks and live/pack/water returns retain same-state links. Differences need observed loss or state-change evidence; nonfinal transfers are never forced to 1 kg. |

## 5. System Boundary

### Boundary Abstraction

| Field | Value |
| --- | --- |
| declared_starting_condition | Actual documented received captive eggs, hatchlings, juveniles or broodstock and opening animal/feed/asset stocks with ancestry and inherited burdens; declare which phases occur on site |
| starting_condition_role | Evidence-based foreground truncation with retained upstream reproductive, nursery, growout, feed and logistics services, not an origin-free cut-off |
| product_classification_scope | CPC 3.0 04462 is broader: this PCR covers one captive-origin species, flow-through route and whole-live never-frozen gate only |
| recursive_input_rule | Record same-category received or returned animals by actual stage/state, quantity and inherited burdens; stop tracing at the declared evidenced supplier boundary and link required upstream dataset or explicit reviewed gap, never recurse indefinitely or reset burdens |
| upstream_dataset_requirement | Supplier captive origin, reproductive/nursery service, feed capture/culture and cold-chain, energy/water/material/service and acquisition transport datasets or documented primary evidence with compatible scope |
| disclosure | Actual location, cohort/period, stage coverage, inherited upstream service, full failures and reproductive outputs, stocks, shared assets/service life, holding state, every pre-receipt movement, allocation, missing records and uncertainty |

### Boundary Rules

| rule_id | Applies to | Rule | source_ids |
| --- | --- | --- | --- |
| boundary_route | foreground_route | Keep source-supported captive production separate from application-proven final collection and physical receipt. The source monitoring loop returns animals and is not a harvest/sale. Research anesthesia, sexing, DNA, tagging and destructive sampling are not production prescriptions. | `capaz-cuttlefish-2020`; `cuttlefish-accounting-method` |
| boundary_phases | managed_culture | Keep all actual reproductive service, eggs, hatchlings, broodstock, failed cohorts, opening/closing stocks and termination in full-cycle attribution. Retained unhatched offspring carry reproductive service; a narrower actual nonbreeding period requires proof and inherited upstream burden. | `cuttlefish-accounting-method` |
| boundary_holding | bounded_holding | Select active only from observed interval/intervention records; bypass requires matched direct grading-to-presentation transfer. Unknown state is a gap and never zero or bypass. Preserve actual before/after live state, inputs and losses. | `cuttlefish-accounting-method` |
| boundary_support | supporting services | Model actual sand filtration, decanting, aeration/shading and shared tanks/filters/pumps/air equipment/feed cold store through measured service and attribution. Enumerate every consuming node and period. Complete services exclude covered components/releases, and component models exclude the complete service. | `capaz-cuttlefish-2020`; `cuttlefish-accounting-method` |
| boundary_gate | delivery | The gate is independent first physical receipt of accepted live whole animals, regardless of payer. Include every prior movement, load/unload, waiting and failed delivery event; record carrier water/package and actual returns separately. Exclude subsequent use or disposal. | `cuttlefish-accounting-method` |
| boundary_fate | all inventory rows | Apply each collection obligation by adding one independent card per actual identified exchange with native property/unit, state, time, destination and evidence. Actual unused state requires evidence; unknown is not zero. Pair internal water/matter/package/animal transfers and stock/return ledgers, identify all intended outputs, actual losses, waste and environmental releases without inventing occurrence. | `cuttlefish-accounting-method` |

## 6. Process Inventory Structure

### Process Map

| process_id | process_name | inclusion | inclusion_condition | role | quantitative_reference |
| --- | --- | --- | --- | --- | --- |
| water_supply | Seawater preparation and actual effluent management | required | Source-context sand filtration, decanting and aeration; actual effluent routing retained | supporting water service | Declared seawater and effluent volumes |
| feed_preparation | Live and thawed grass-shrimp supply and preparation | required | Live nursery feed and frozen-origin thawed growout feed; actual storage and cleaning | foreground feed preparation | Measured feed in its actual supplied state |
| managed_culture | Captive reproduction, direct hatchling nursery and flow-through growout | required | Actual captive starting condition and all claimed production phases | managed biological production | Measured live whole animals, offspring and stocks |
| final_collection | Independent nonreturn collection from managed culture | required | Application records prove removal toward delivery rather than sampling-return | independent collection | Measured live whole collected animals |
| grading | Actual live-product grade and destination decision | required | Actual grading and destination record for collected lots | grading and sorting | Measured accepted, alternate and returned states |
| bounded_holding | Bounded post-grade live holding | conditional | active only for observed holding with start/end and intervention; bypass requires direct handoff proof; unknown blocks completion | live-state preservation | Measured live whole animals after the bounded interval |
| presentation | Protective live presentation | required | Actual protective arrangement before dispatch, including evidenced reusable containers | packaging and presentation | Measured presented live whole animals plus separate water/package |
| delivery | Every pre-receipt movement and first physical recipient acceptance | required | All internal/external pre-receipt legs regardless of payer or ownership | delivery and handover | 1 kg accepted live whole animal net wet mass |

Each conditional semantic card expands only from observed actual instances. Output/input pairs share transfer ids and the same physical state/native quantity; declared aqueous wastes sent to water_supply remain waste at both interfaces. Carrier water, packaging, animal stocks and returns remain independent of animal reference mass. Conditional service duration is native h, not material mass. If a real service uses another native property/unit, declare that instance with the matching verified property and unit rather than coercing it into this timed-service collection obligation.

### Process: Seawater preparation and actual effluent management (`water_supply`)

Record raw intake and any purchased water separately, the actual filter/decant/aeration train, metering, backwash, water quality and every consuming phase. This node owns intake and treatment; receiving nodes own their measured supplied water. Do not infer universal effluent treatment or pollutant occurrence.

## 7. Allocation and Co-product Handling

| rule_id | Applies to | Rule | source_ids |
| --- | --- | --- | --- |
| attribute_precedence | foreground burdens | First subdivide independently measured events, phases, outputs and services. Then apply documented causal physical attribution to shared production/asset/service burdens using actual occupancy, operating time or metered demand suited to the burden. Keep the rationale and sensitivity; no universal share or source-paper productivity default. | `cuttlefish-accounting-method` |
| attribute_outputs | intended outputs | Enumerate accepted live animals, each actual alternate animal grade, transferred viable offspring or broodstock, usable incidentals and stocks with handoffs. Retained viable offspring and broodstock carry burdens into their next period; unhatched offspring are carried reproductive service, not delivered adult output. Residue and waste are not silently promoted to co-products or given avoided-product credits. | `cuttlefish-accounting-method` |
| attribute_economic | inseparable joint burdens | Only if subdivision and causal physical attribution cannot resolve an actual joint burden, use comparable nonnegative producer-gate net-sales values for the same period/market/state and a positive total denominator, including defensible retained-stock valuations. Exclude taxes, freight beyond the common gate and unrelated receipts consistently. Missing, zero or negative values require a justified alternative with sensitivity; never allocate by profit or silently set negative shares. | `cuttlefish-accounting-method` |
| attribute_periods | cohorts periods and shared services | Index egg/reproductive service, direct hatchling nursery, growout, collection, grades, holding, presentation, delivery, cleaning/changeover, idle and failed periods, asset replacement and termination. Carry opening quantities and inherited burdens to closing stocks and next-period receipts. Shared-asset service life, use and end-of-life use actual evidence and all consumers including other facility outputs, not only successful reference lots. | `cuttlefish-accounting-method` |
| attribute_once | all exchanges | Assign one owner per event, service and physical transfer. Internal output/input pairs are connectors, not two independent burden-bearing acquisitions or final products. Do not duplicate complete services with component fuel/electricity/assets/releases; reconcile all consumer shares and carry failed/rejected/returned-lot burdens before dividing attributed native quantities by accepted A. | `cuttlefish-accounting-method` |

### Data Quality Requirements

| requirement_id | Applies to | Requirement | Evidence |
| --- | --- | --- | --- |
| identity_quality | animal and feed lots | Prove actual species, captive ancestry, received stage, live never-frozen final state, nonornamental use and physical custody. Qualitative literature supports route selection only, not collected quantities. | Supplier and cohort ancestry; actual condition, grade and receipt records |
| quantity_quality | all rows | Retain calibration/tare/carrier separation, independently observed counts/grade, paired transfers, stock ledgers and same-lot sampling uncertainty. Independent historic/site reference samples must support empirical guardrails; a current batch maximum cannot validate itself. | Scale/meter logs; transfer/stock ids; sampling design; independent QA dataset |
| coverage_quality | periods nodes and assets | Cover failed and idle periods, full claimed reproduction, mortality, feed preparation/remnants, cleaning/changeover, shared assets and all consumers, actual package turns and all pre-receipt movements. Unknown conditions block completion. | Event ledger; asset/service-life ledger; consumer shares; actual active/bypass proof |
| range_quality | all ranges | Except the final same-lot identity, 0..U_row uncertainty ranges are provisional reasoned placeholders without established finite upper bounds, never measured values, defaults, limits or evidence of zero. Replace with independent actual observations and reviewed uncertainty before final dataset use. | Actual independent records and reviewed quantity/uncertainty derivation |
| binding_quality | all exchange cards and collection obligations | Before final TIDAS exchanges each actual independent supply, waste, release and animal state must have verified concrete flow/property/unit identities; collection obligations are not automatic UUID bindings. | Exact detail/property/unit evidence and methodology review |

Retain substance/species or particle size, air/water/soil compartment, time, measured activity/concentration, sampled volume, formula, factor/source and uncertainty for each instance.

For calculated instances retain actual formula, measured inputs, factor and source before attribution. <br> - Value mode: Calculated value (`calculated_value`) <br> - Specificity: Site-specific (`site_specific`) <br> - Normalization basis: per 1 kg reference flow <br> - Basis kind: Reference flow (`reference_flow`) <br> - Evidence kind: Calculated from collection (`calculated_from_collection`) <br> - Collection protocol: `cp_delivery` <br> - Sources: `cuttlefish-accounting-method` <br> - Range: Provisional unestablished uncertainty; independent observations required <br> - Range role: Uncertainty range (`uncertainty_range`) <br> - Lower: 0 <br> - Upper: U_delivery_releases <br> - Unit: kg <br> - Basis: per 1 kg reference flow <br> - Basis kind: Reference flow (`reference_flow`) <br> - Evidence kind: Reasoned estimate (`reasoned_estimate`) | Node collection protocol, original records and individual identity, quantity, range and destination evidence |
| `dq_logistics_water_balance` | logistics, services and water/nutrient balances | Actual payload includes accompanying water, ice, packaging and other cargo. Empty return/repositioning still consumes activity: account for its actual fuel/distance/vehicle service and explicit attribution; zero cargo tonne-kilometres cannot erase that duty. Do not duplicate a complete service and covered fuel, materials, assets or direct releases. Measure external abstraction, supplied water product, internal circulation and actual returned/discharged water separately; never deduct internal recirculation again from external intake. Net nutrient increment/retention is a separate balance diagnostic, never automatically a negative elementary flow, negative emission or avoided burden. | Actual load/vehicle duty records, service scope, same-lot water/substance balance and method evidence |

## 9. Validation Rules

| rule_id | Applies to | Rule | source_ids |
| --- | --- | --- | --- |
| validate_reference | live_receipt_reference | Require positive A, one final accepted animal output, matched actual receipt, live/whole/never-frozen species and use proof, animal-body-water retention and free/carrier-water/package exclusion. A/A is the only 1..1 identity. | `reference-mass-identity`; `cuttlefish-accounting-method` |
| validate_route | process map | Require actual independent collection, grading states/destinations, holding active or evidenced bypass, protective presentation and every pre-receipt movement. Sampling-return never satisfies harvest or receipt; unknown state is incomplete. | `cuttlefish-accounting-method` |
| validate_ledger | all inventory rows | Match each physical transfer, stock and return in state/native property/unit/quantity/lot/period and burdens; independently reconcile intended outputs, stocks, feed offered/remnants, mortality, incidentals, aqueous fates and identified releases. Do not fabricate closure by treating body-water changes or unseen emissions as measured. | `cuttlefish-accounting-method` |
| validate_attribution | shared outputs periods and assets | Reconcile all output/period/shared-consumer shares once, carry reproductive/offspring/broodstock and failed-period burdens, retain asset service life/replacement/termination, and justify economic fallback denominator/stock valuation or alternative with sensitivity. | `cuttlefish-accounting-method` |
| validate_evidence | collected calculated and provisional evidence | Require own-node collection protocols and actual record sources; calculated energy/releases need per-instance measured inputs/formula/factor/source. Provisional ranges and qualitative literature do not establish actual quantity, legal/food-health/welfare status, profitability, default feed rate or commercial delivery. | `cuttlefish-accounting-method` |
| `validate_atomic_completion` | all applicable per-flow collection obligations and final exchanges | Final dataset completion and validation require every actual exchange to have an independent atomic card and its own quantity, property/native unit, collection or calculation evidence, range/uncertainty evidence, normalization, actual destination and verified UUID. Unknown identity, activity state, quantity, range evidence or fate blocks completion; it is never zero, a presumed bypass or permission to omit an obligation. Every important concrete flow retains its own range/uncertainty evidence collection duty; a symbolic upper bound is not an empirical range. | |

## 10. Published Dataset Profile

| required_quality_disclosure | Actual primary record coverage, failed periods and stock carryover; uncertainties/calibrations/sampling; provisional ranges replaced or unresolved; quantified calculation inputs/factors/sources; identity and methodology review; excluded service components; missing states/records |
| update_trigger | Changed species/origin/production mode/feed/water system; changed stage, reproductive attribution, asset life or consumer set; holding/presentation/gate or logistics change; new measurements/factors/identities or material data gaps |
