# Farmed whole live green sea urchins from recirculating V-trough growout

## 1. Scope and Applicability

This PCR covers Strongylocentrotus droebachiensis of documented hatchery-seed origin, grown in land-based recirculating seawater V-troughs in Maine with a formulated sea-urchin diet, collected manually, sorted and protectively presented whole and live through first physical recipient receipt. Native test and spines remain; the reference is raw and never frozen.

The University of Maine 2009–2013 demonstration supports the growout route and equipment responsibilities, including feed-history distinctions and prior nursery phases. It produced animals for subsequent market/quality research; it does not establish an actual commercial shipment, commercial profitability or current sales. NOAA's 2023 manual discusses whole-live end-user channels as potential. Each data package must independently prove its actual eligible receipt. No source temperature, stocking density, ration, survival, duration, feed conversion, gonad yield, price, safety, disease-treatment or legal prescription is adopted.

Exclude wild-adult gonad enhancement, sea ranching, sea-cage growout, co-culture, ornamental animals, dead/fresh/chilled-only products, freezing, evisceration, roe extraction and subsequent product processing. Upstream nursery history is required; on-site nursery is separately included when actual. A cohort's actual earlier trial diets cannot be deleted to describe a formulated-diet period.

## 4. Measurement and Unit Rules

| rule_id | Applies to | Required property | Required unit | Rule |
| --- | --- | --- | --- | --- |
| `reference_mass` | reference product | Mass | kg | Weigh the same accepted live lot at actual recipient receipt on a calibrated scale; record tare and reproducible free-water removal without removing body parts. A is accepted whole-animal wet mass, not feed, gonad, gross package or dispatch mass. |
| `native_units` | all inventory rows | Recorded property | Native recorded unit | Record wet/dry condition, water density, feed as-fed mass, count and sampled whole-animal mass, service/energy units and pollutant chemical basis. Convert only with measured compatible records; retain kWh, t*km and h where used. No universal count-to-mass or whole-to-roe factor. |
| `transfer_mass` | internal animal transfers | Mass | kg | Pair transfer ids with one cohort, time, state, mass/count and boundary on both sides. Internal quantities remain measured and are not forced to 1 kg. Account carrying water and matter separately. |

## 5. System Boundary

### Boundary Abstraction

| Field | Value |
| --- | --- |
| declared_starting_condition | Documented hatchery-origin live seed at actual nursery/growout entry with complete preceding production, nursery and transport history |
| starting_condition_role | Foreground entry gate; upstream burdens remain linked, not cut off |
| product_classification_scope | Selected narrower aquaculture green-sea-urchin whole-live RAS route under cpc:3.0:04522 |
| recursive_input_rule | Nursery-ready seed and returned live stock carry their actual upstream and previous-period burdens; internal returns do not restart or duplicate seed production |
| upstream_dataset_requirement | Traceable hatchery/nursery seed, actual feeds, utilities, materials/assets, treatment and logistics datasets with compatible geography, period, units and boundary; unavailable inputs remain disclosed gaps |
| disclosure | Sites/cohorts/phases, stock boundaries, active/inactive/unknown holding and nursery states, complete pre-receipt route regardless payer, actual recipient receipt, exclusions, intended outputs and attribution assumptions |

| rule_id | applies_to | rule | source_ids |
| --- | --- | --- | --- |
| `boundary_route` | nursery; growout | Include actual on-site nursery and complete prior seed history, then V-trough RAS growth, feed changes, water/solids treatment, maintenance, monitoring, failed batches and mortality. Historical methods establish route responsibilities, not site-specific quantities or proof of sale. | umaine-green-urchin-growout-2013 |
| `boundary_handoffs` | all nodes | Use T0 or external E0 for growout seed, T1/T1m for culture withdrawal, T2/T2m for collected animals/matter, T3 and T4 when holding occurs or T3b bypass when absent, T5 for dispatch and TR for sorting returns. Each actual handoff has paired outputs/inputs and one quantity/state owner. On-site nursery or holding unknown state cannot default to inactive. | |
| `boundary_receipt` | delivery | Include every actual pre-receipt loading, transport, interim holding, terminal operation and acceptance event irrespective of ownership, payer or invoice. End at evidenced first physical recipient acceptance; retain rejected dispatch burdens. Potential whole-live channels do not prove a shipment. | noaa-green-urchin-manual-2023 |
| `boundary_assets` | all nodes | Record V-troughs, plumbing, biofilter, solids filter, fractionator, oxygen/UV systems, pumps, building, tools and reuse containers as actual asset/service instances. Link consuming nodes, cohorts and periods, repair/replacement, actual service life and end-of-use fate; no prescribed lifetime. | umaine-green-urchin-growout-2013 |
| `boundary_fates` | all nodes | Supplier water is product supply; direct withdrawal is elementary input; internal circulation is neither repeated withdrawal nor discharge. Distinguish actual treatment-bound wastes from direct environmental releases, returned carrier water from each pollutant, and fossil from biogenic carbon. Expand each conditional umbrella into actual zero/one/multiple documented exchanges; unknown applicability is a gap, not zero. | |

## 7. Allocation and Co-product Handling

| rule_id | applies_to | rule | source_ids |
| --- | --- | --- | --- |
| `allocation_cohorts` | nursery; growout; all subsequent nodes | Index hatchery, nursery, growout and dispatch cohorts against continuously operated RAS periods. Subdivide independently metered feed/equipment/events first; carry the remaining shared operating burden using documented biomass-time and actual service demand, with metered energy alternatives and sensitivity where these differ. Record all cohorts served, including failures and live closing stock. No burden is assigned only to survivors of a convenient period. | |
| `allocation_outputs` | all intended product outputs | List every intended animal destination, grade, research/outplant transfer, live retained cohort and return with its gate and quantity. Attribute separable activities directly; allocate residual shared animal production burden using measured animal biomass-time/service demand before final mass normalization, justify physical causality, and test receipt-mass or documented relative-value sensitivity if causality is unresolved. Retained live stock carries accumulated burden into its later period rather than becoming current waste or accepted A. No avoided-production credit. | |
| `allocation_assets` | shared infrastructure; reusable containers | Maintain one asset/service ledger covering construction materials, service-life evidence, repairs, replacements, idle/failed periods, cleanup and termination. Enumerate every consuming node and period; use measured pump/filter hours, metered service, occupied volume/time or actual reuse turns as appropriate, explain selection and alternatives. Sum assigned fractions to the recorded service total; no universal lifetime or free reusable container. | |
| `allocation_service` | complete supplier services | A complete purchased transport, handling, treatment or asset service owns its included components once. If component modelling replaces it, document consistent coverage and remove overlapping service burden. Internal paired transfers move physical quantities and accumulated burdens without creating new production or a second final animal output. | |

## 8. Foreground Data Collection, Calculation, and Quality Rules

Each inventory card represents one stated exchange. Section 8 collection obligations require separate additional cards wherever actual material/substance, product state, destination or native unit differs. Record observed absence with evidence. Every row's U_row is a separately documented site/period/instance upper uncertainty bound in that row's native unit per 1 kg reference flow. The symbolic interval 0..U_row is an unresolved range-evidence requirement, not an observed range, default rate, universal cap or permission to treat a required active input as zero. Replace it with traceable records/uncertainty before final exchange production; a positive active event requires its actual positive quantity. Only the same-lot final reference has the algebraic 1..1 interval.

## 9. Validation Rules

| rule_id | applies_to | rule | source_ids |
| --- | --- | --- | --- |
| `validation_scope` | reference | Require S. droebachiensis, hatchery origin, Maine land-based V-trough RAS/formulated-feed history, whole native test/spines, live never-frozen state and actual first physical receipt. Excluded routes or missing acceptance cannot be relabelled to pass. | |
| `validation_mass` | all nodes | Check calibrated receipt net mass, positive A, final 1 kg, native units, feed/water/count conversions and exact matched transfer state/mass/count, including carrying matter and both holding branches. Internal quantities need not equal 1 kg. | mass-normalization-identity |
| `validation_outputs` | all nodes | Account every intended grade/destination and retained/returned cohort separately from wastes; require receipt/stock gate and burden ownership, no duplicated final output and no environmental credit. Include collection independent of growth and sorting's incident matter. | |
| `validation_periods` | nursery; growout; shared assets | Reconcile run/period/cohort boundaries, cleaning/changeover/repair/replacement/termination, failed periods, mortality, open stock and shared service fractions. Require attribution rationale, actual service-life evidence and sensitivity; prevent repeated asset or complete-service components. | |
| `validation_fates` | water; wastes; direct releases | Require actual supplier/abstraction distinction, wastewater treatment versus direct discharge, carrier water versus pollutant species, chemical/N/P/carbon/medium basis and fossil/biogenic distinction. Unknown fate or release is unresolved, not zero. | |
| `validation_states` | nursery; holding; all applicable collection obligations | Select actual observed active/absent state and populate zero/one/multiple concrete instances with own quantity, native unit, recipient and verified UUID. Missing state, symbolic U_row, identity or method evidence must remain disclosed; checker success is not publication readiness. | |
| `validate_atomic_completion` | all applicable per-flow collection obligations and final exchanges | Final dataset completion and validation require every actual exchange to have an independent atomic card and its own quantity, property/native unit, collection or calculation evidence, range/uncertainty evidence, normalization, actual destination and verified UUID. Unknown identity, activity state, quantity, range evidence or fate blocks completion; it is never zero, a presumed bypass or permission to omit an obligation. Every important concrete flow retains its own range/uncertainty evidence collection duty; a symbolic upper bound is not an empirical range. | |
