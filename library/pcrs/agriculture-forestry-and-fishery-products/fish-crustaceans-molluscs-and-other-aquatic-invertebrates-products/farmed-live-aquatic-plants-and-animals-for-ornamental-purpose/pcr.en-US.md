# Farmed live ornamental red cherry shrimp

## 1. Scope and Applicability
This PCR governs foreground data production for captive-bred Neocaridina davidi, using the Buenos Aires source-context route of breeding, egg incubation, direct hatching and juvenile growout in dechlorinated freshwater plastic aquaria with actual aeration, heating, light, Java moss and formulated tropical-fish feed. It ends at the first physical ornamental recipient's receipt of whole live never-frozen animals. Sganga (2019) supports experimental captive production; it does not demonstrate a commercial dispatch. Each application must establish the actual live collection, condition/destination sorting, bounded holding or evidenced bypass, protective presentation and complete pre-receipt logistics through primary records.

Chapter 5 plastic-refuge/water-schedule/three-diet trials are outside the selected moss route. No planktonic larval-rearing phase is invented. Experimental zero-degree anesthesia, sacrifice, freezing and biochemical sampling are neither production harvest nor mandatory quality control for this live product. Exclude wild shrimp, ornamental fish, other species, food products, dead/frozen animals as reference output, and post-receipt breeding/use. A lower-grade live animal with an intended ornamental destination remains a product. No culture density, temperature, feed rate, age, breeding yield, survival factor, health threshold or safety, legality, welfare or disease-free claim is prescribed.

## 4. Measurement and Unit Rules
| rule_id | Applies to | Required property | Required unit | Rule |
| --- | --- | --- | --- | --- |
| `reference_mass` | reference product | Mass `93a60a56-a3c8-11da-a746-0800200b9a66` | kg | A is accepted net animal wet mass of the same received live lot in kg, using cp_delivery; exclude carrier/free water, plants, containers and incidental matter. Use calibrated tare-controlled direct weighing or a documented representative same-lot count-and-weighed-sample estimate with sampling uncertainty; do not infer species-average body mass. Record live state at receipt independently. |
| `native_units` | all inventory rows | Actual instance property | Native unit | Retain electricity as energy, transport as its service unit, gases/materials as their verified property and unit; never convert services or electricity into kg. Water is recorded in kg here; volume measurements require recorded same-condition density and conversion evidence. |
| `animal_count` | all animal rows | Mass and supplemental count | kg; individuals | Record animal mass and count independently at each handoff; sample-derived mass requires same-lot live-state and size/grade representation, tare/drain method, sample size and uncertainty. Retain commercial per-individual information; no count-to-mass constant is supplied. |
| `water_and_substance_basis` | carrier water, residues and emissions | Actual substance property | Native unit | Separate animal, water, feed, moss and incidentals. Internal managed water is not new environmental abstraction; supplied water is product, environmental abstraction is elementary. Emissions require individual substance, chemical or element basis, fossil/biogenic carbon provenance and receiving medium; water return is distinct from pollutants. |

## 5. System Boundary
### Boundary Abstraction
| Field | Value |
| --- | --- |
| declared_starting_condition | Received broodstock and their supplied ancestry burden, attributable opening captive stock, supplied freshwater plus independently recorded actual dechlorination inputs/operations, feed/Java moss/materials and shared assets at the actual culture site |
| starting_condition_role | Disclosed foreground entry of managed breeding stock and inputs, not a zero-burden biological origin |
| product_classification_scope | Captive-bred live ornamental crustacean subset of cpc:3.0:04913 |
| recursive_input_rule | Same-category received/returned/retained animals retain cohort, quantity and inherited burden. Declare the upstream stopping boundary; never recurse indefinitely or reset broodstock/opening stock to zero. Internal stock transfers are not new purchases. |
| upstream_dataset_requirement | Require compatible supplied-stock, feed, water treatment, electricity, material, infrastructure and service datasets with boundary/quality disclosure; record unresolved upstream gaps instead of excluding burdens |
| disclosure | Site, supplier/ancestry and opening inventory, actual cohort/periods, all node activations, animal and water transfers, attribution drivers, assets/lifetimes/replacement/cleaning, pre-receipt service coverage, physical recipient gate, gaps and sensitivity |

| rule_id | applies_to | rule | source_ids |
| --- | --- | --- | --- |
| `sb_managed` | managed_biology | Breeding/incubation/direct hatching/growout are managed biological production, indexed by actual cohort and tank-period. Received stock, feed, moss as substrate/partial food, water conditioning and energy are management inputs with distinct roles. No unmeasured biofilm/moss consumption is invented as manufactured feed. | sganga-red-cherry-2019 |
| `sb_collection` | live_collection | Live physical removal from the culture context has its own operation/times/equipment and handoff T1, independently of growth. Record co-collected water/moss/incidentals entering sorting and every animal loss/return. Laboratory sacrifice is excluded. | sganga-red-cherry-2019 |
| `sb_sort` | live_sorting | Sorting receives unsorted live animals plus actual incidental matter; identify every accepted grade, alternate live destination, returned/retained animal and dead/waste output, with exact handoff and independent acceptance evidence. Do not classify lower grade or rejected-for-one-buyer animals as waste automatically. | |
| `sb_hold` | live_holding | Activate only an evidenced bounded live-maintenance intervention after sorting, with start/end, actual conditions/resources and outgoing live state T3. Otherwise document direct bypass T2B into presentation. Unknown holding state is an evidence gap, not bypass. No survival or duration guarantee follows. | |
| `sb_presentation` | live_presentation | Enclose/protect actual live animals using documented carrier freshwater and packaging/reusable containers; retain animal and carrier/package identities separately. T4 is the outgoing live presentation state. Distribution belongs to delivery, not presentation. | |
| `sb_delivery` | recipient_delivery | Include every actual movement, waiting/transfer and live-maintenance event before first physical ornamental recipient custody, whatever payer/operator/invoice boundary. End only at documented physical receipt; include pre-receipt mortality/returns/rejections and package/water disposition. | |
| `sb_events` | all_nodes | Include actual failed/no-output cohorts, cleaning, changeover, replacements, termination, usable alternate products, recovered materials and wastes. Assets/aeration/heating/light shared by nodes or periods have one owner and a disclosed service boundary. No universal lifetime or free reusable container is assumed. | |
| `sb_environment` | actual_exchanges | Apply collection obligations by adding one independent card per actual exchange only after observations. Separate treatment waste from direct environmental water return and individual pollutants; no unsupported environmental credit. Complete service datasets exclude duplicate component energy, assets, fuel and releases. | |

## 6. Process Inventory Structure
### Process Map
| process_id | process_name | inclusion | inclusion_condition | role | quantitative_reference |
| --- | --- | --- | --- | --- | --- |
| managed_biology | Captive breeding and juvenile growout | required | Selected moss-based route with actual cohort/tank-period records | Managed biological production | Live stock ready for collection T0 plus actual closing stock, remaining reproductive service carried to future cohorts and intended alternate products |
| live_collection | Independent live physical collection | required | Actual removal operation required for delivered lots | Harvest boundary | Unsorted live animals T1, actual co-collected matter and returns |
| live_sorting | Condition and destination sorting | required | Actual live-product route | Grading boundary | All declared grades/destinations including T2H or T2B |
| live_holding | Bounded live maintenance | conditional | Actual documented post-sort intervention before presentation; no automatic activation | Preservation boundary | Live held animals T3 and all alternative/loss states |
| live_presentation | Carrier-water and protective presentation | required | Actual enclosure/protection recorded | Presentation boundary | Whole live presented animals T4 with separate water/package handoffs |
| recipient_delivery | All logistics through physical receipt | required | Every actual leg including on-site physical movement, or evidenced recipient collection at site | Delivery boundary | Accepted net whole live reference animals plus other receipt destinations |

Production mode is cohort/batch breeding and growout with overlapping tank-periods where observed, not an assumed continuous yield. The records distinguish broodstock maintenance, incubation/hatching, growout, collection, any holding, presentation, delivery, cleaning/changeover and termination periods. Shared tanks/aeration/heating/lighting, facilities, equipment and containers require service/consumer ledgers.

Each card's ordinary quantity is the attributable actual exchange divided by accepted same-lot mass A, per 1 kg reference flow. This does not fix internal animals, water, energy or services at 1 kg. T0→T1→T2H→T3→T4 is the holding path; T0→T1→T2B→T4 is the evidenced bypass. Sender/receiver use identical transfer ids, live state, count and animal mass. CW1/CW2H/CW2B/CW3/CW4 carry managed freshwater separately; IM1 carries actual co-collected incidental matter. R-<node>-<instance> returns live stock to managed biology, with equal receiving records. RW-<node>-<instance> returns reusable carrier/moss/material to managed biology; other destinations need paired own-node instance records. Transfers never generate new burden or duplicate upstream abstractions.

An umbrella card requires individual instance identities/destinations/properties/native units and its own row-instance id. No unresolved umbrella acquires a fixed UUID. Optional absence requires evidence; missing observations are not zero. On every card, symbolic U_<row-instance> is an unestablished upper uncertainty bound to be independently supported from primary observations and sensitivity before final dataset use. The symbolic 0..U interval is reasoned uncertainty, neither an empirical range nor a universal cap. Actual amount evidence remains collected records. Each node's collection protocol governs all its card instances and paired handoffs.

## 7. Allocation and Co-product Handling
| rule_id | applies_to | rule | source_ids |
| --- | --- | --- | --- |
| `al_subdivide` | all_nodes | Prefer separately measured cohorts, grades, operations and service instances. Each animal or material has one transfer identity and burden owner; output at an internal handoff is not also a final independently sold output. No substitution or environmental credit is supplied. | |
| `al_broodstock` | managed_biology | Attribute received breeding stock, ancestry/opening burdens and adult maintenance across their actual reproductive service and intended outputs. Preserve service already consumed by current offspring, remaining service carried to future cohorts, replacement/death/termination and closing stock. Use evidenced breeder occupancy/biomass-time and reproductive-service records with a documented causal rationale; if no defensible causal driver exists, disclose the gap and test alternative time, biomass and output-value drivers rather than claiming completed attribution. Do not charge all current offspring while also carrying the same burden forward. | |
| `al_cohorts` | managed_biology | Trace actual incubation/direct-hatch/growout cohorts and overlapping tanks/periods. Allocate shared operating burdens by measured equipment use, occupied tank-time or another documented causal service driver; separate directly attributable feed/water first. Include unsuccessful/no-output cohorts, mortality, replacements, cleaning and changeover in their responsible service pool, rather than dropping them or dividing a failed period by zero. Carry to linked viable outputs or disclose unresolved allocation. | |
| `al_outputs` | all_intended_outputs | Enumerate every reference grade, alternate ornamental grade, transferred breeding/juvenile product, usable incidental and actual return/closing stock. After subdivision, use demonstrated causal biological/service drivers when possible. Where joint output burdens cannot be causally separated, document economic shares from comparable nonnegative producer-gate net-sales values, including declared retained-stock values, with price period/source and a strictly positive denominator. Zero, negative or unavailable values require a justified alternative driver and sensitivity; do not use profit ratios. Test mass and service-driver alternatives. Count is supplementary and not an unqualified equivalent for animals of different size. No hierarchy shortcut makes downgraded products waste. | |
| `al_shared` | assets_and_services | Maintain one service ledger for culture tanks, aeration/heating/light equipment, facility, collection/sorting/holding equipment, containers and each actual shared service; enumerate consuming nodes/cohorts/periods. Attribute installed/replaced/maintained assets over evidenced service life and actual use/capacity, using observed runtime/occupancy or physically justified driver. Include idle/failure/cleanup/termination shares and sensitivity to utilization and life; unsupported standard lifetimes or free infrastructure are prohibited. Shares plus carried service must reconcile to one pool. | |
| `al_packaging` | presentation_and_delivery | Single-use materials receive actual attributable production and treatment burdens. Reusable containers require actual service turns, cleaning/repair/replacement, losses, return movements and end-of-use evidence with a consistent service denominator and sensitivity; no unlimited reuse or omitted return logistics. Presentation owns package introduction; downstream movements do not repurchase it. | |
| `al_delivery` | recipient_delivery | Attribute actual pre-receipt legs using documented shipment composition, carrier water/package gross load, distance, capacity, empty/return movements and relevant service driver. Retain animal net mass for reference normalization. Complete transport or holding services replace covered components explicitly; uncovered components remain. All failed shipments and other destinations retain burdens. No payer or invoice boundary truncates transport. | |

## 8. Foreground Data Collection, Calculation, and Quality Rules
### Data Collection Protocols
All protocols retain raw/native quantities before normalization. Each actual card instance records row id, identity, native property/unit, operator/site, cohort/period, time, transfer/receipt id, destination, live state/count/animal mass or material quantity, conditional activation, complete-service coverage, attribution share and measurement uncertainty. Zero requires evidence of actual absence. For conditional resource/emission umbrellas, retain separate records for every individual exchange and unit. A metered/measured numerator is collected_record; a power multiplied by runtime estimate, allocated/normalized electricity value or calculated emission requires an explicit actual-instance formula, measured input components, applicable factor/source/unit/basis and uncertainty, value_mode calculated_value and evidence_kind calculated_from_collection. Override the common umbrella amount metadata on each calculated instance; never silently label a calculation as a direct measurement. Samples are tied to the same live lot/grade with calibrated tare, carrier-water exclusion and sampling uncertainty; measurements never require source-study sacrifice.

### Calculation Rules
| rule_id | Applies to | Formula or rule | Inputs | Output | source_ids |
| --- | --- | --- | --- | --- | --- |
| normalize_lot | all inventory rows | Attributable actual instance quantity divided by A gives its native quantity per 1 kg reference flow; A is the accepted same-lot net animal wet mass in kg. Keep every transfer's actual numerator; no internal-feed normalization to 1 kg. | actual instance quantity; attribution share; A; cp_delivery | Native-unit quantity per 1 kg reference flow | mass-balance-identity |
| final_reference | accepted_live_shrimp | Accepted output normalization is A/A = 1 kg for the same accepted live lot with A greater than zero; the card's finite expression is 1 kg. This is a calculation from receipt records, not a fixed empirical yield. | A; cp_delivery | 1 kg accepted net live animal mass | mass-balance-identity |
| sample_mass | all animal rows | A recorded count multiplied by representative same-lot sampled mean net live animal mass estimates that lot's mass only; retain sampling design, weighed sample/count, live condition/grade representation, tare/drain method and propagated uncertainty. No species-wide conversion is supplied. | lot count; sample animal mass; sample count; sampling uncertainty; own-node protocol | Estimated same-lot animal mass with uncertainty | |
| stock_service | managed_biology | Reconcile carried opening burden plus new attributable breeding service against current offspring, intended alternate products, actual losses and carried closing/future service. Biological growth is not a purchase; future service is a ledger commitment rather than hypothetical animal output. | cohort/period stock and events; service pool; causal driver; sensitivity | Reconciled current and carried stock/service shares | |
| instance_range | all non-reference cards | Establish U_<row-instance> in the actual native unit from independently reviewed observations, limits and sensitivity. Until established, 0..U is symbolic reasoned uncertainty only; a missing bound or conditional state blocks a final inventory value, not a default zero. | actual instance unit; observations; uncertainty evidence; sensitivity | Supported per-instance uncertainty bounds | |

### Data Quality Requirements

| dq_services | all services | Match complete-service coverage to actual energy/assets/materials/releases and retain only uncovered components; each power-times-runtime or emissions calculation declares actual-instance formula/factor, measured components and calculated_value/calculated_from_collection metadata | Service boundary and component ledger |
| dq_identity | all actual exchanges | Verify concrete flow/property/unit support for each final exchange; retain conditional umbrella until observed instances exist; reference identity gap precludes publication | Compatible identity detail evidence and dataset records |

| `dq_logistics_water_balance` | logistics, services and water/nutrient balances | Actual payload includes accompanying water, ice, packaging and other cargo. Empty return/repositioning still consumes activity: account for its actual fuel/distance/vehicle service and explicit attribution; zero cargo tonne-kilometres cannot erase that duty. Do not duplicate a complete service and covered fuel, materials, assets or direct releases. Measure external abstraction, supplied water product, internal circulation and actual returned/discharged water separately; never deduct internal recirculation again from external intake. Net nutrient increment/retention is a separate balance diagnostic, never automatically a negative elementary flow, negative emission or avoided burden. | Actual load/vehicle duty records, service scope, same-lot water/substance balance and method evidence |

## 9. Validation Rules
| rule_id | applies_to | rule | source_ids |
| --- | --- | --- | --- |
| `vr_reference` | accepted_live_shrimp | Verify same-lot positive A, live receipt and exact net wet-animal basis, reference name/link/support, separate water/moss/package/incidentals and actual counts/grades; final A/A gives 1 kg only for accepted live output. | mass-balance-identity |
| `vr_route` | all_nodes | Verify complete managed-biology/collection/sorting/presentation/delivery records and actual holding activation or evidenced bypass; no planktonic phase, sacrifice/freezing or chapter 5 alternative trial is substituted into this live route. | sganga-red-cherry-2019 |
| `vr_handoffs` | all_transfers | Require paired CM0/T0/T1/T2H/T2B/T3/T4, CW1/CW2H/CW2B/CW3/CW4, IM1/PK4 and every R/RW instance as applicable, with exact state/unit/quantity/custody and no double reference output or unrecorded destination. | |
| `vr_outputs` | all_intended_outputs | Enumerate every actual live grade/recipient, breeding/juvenile alternate, usable incidental, return and retained stock, separately from mortality/residue/waste; output rejection alone does not justify waste classification. | |
| `vr_attribution` | all_periods_and_consumers | Reconcile broodstock/opening/future service, overlapping cohorts, failed/no-output events, shared assets/services, cleanup/replacement/termination and reusable containers; causal/economic choices need evidence and sensitivity, one burden owner and no double carried/current allocation. | |
| `vr_delivery` | pre_receipt | Prove first physical receipt and include every preceding movement/wait/maintenance regardless payer, including failed shipments; service coverage excludes duplicate components but not uncovered activities. | |
| `vr_instances` | all_card_instances | Every instance needs observed activation/absence, independent native property/unit, own-node protocol, identity/destination and attributable amount/uncertainty. U_<row-instance> and unknown actual state remain evidence gaps; no service kg coercion or search-top-hit binding. | |
| `vr_environment` | actual_releases_and_wastes | Require individual pollutant chemical/carbon/medium basis, water-return separation, treatment destination and service exclusions; no unverified discharge, factor or environmental credit. | |
| `vr_integrity` | PCR_and_dataset | Require current schema-valid deterministic projection, bilingual parity and selected-target checks; state performed/skipped checks and unresolved identities/ranges distinctly. Checker pass does not prove external identity verification, commercial completeness or publication readiness. | |
| `validate_atomic_completion` | all applicable per-flow collection obligations and final exchanges | Final dataset completion and validation require every actual exchange to have an independent atomic card and its own quantity, property/native unit, collection or calculation evidence, range/uncertainty evidence, normalization, actual destination and verified UUID. Unknown identity, activity state, quantity, range evidence or fate blocks completion; it is never zero, a presumed bypass or permission to omit an obligation. Every important concrete flow retains its own range/uncertainty evidence collection duty; a symbolic upper bound is not an empirical range. | |
