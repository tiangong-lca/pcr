# Wild live whole Homarus lobsters at first producer handover

## 1. Scope and Applicability

This PCR covers wild-caught marine Homarus spp., actually living whole food bodies in their native shell at the first producer handover. Actual missing appendages and shell/molt state are disclosed, not reconstructed. The methodology is for foreground data production with complete capture-trip, physical destination and bounded live-handling accounting. No fixed country, species, gear, holding duration or temperature is presumed.

## 4. Measurement and Unit Rules

| rule_id | Applies to | Required property | Required unit | Rule |
| --- | --- | --- | --- | --- |
| reference_mass | reference product | Mass `93a60a56-a3c8-11da-a746-0800200b9a66` | kg | Use calibrated net-body weighing of the actual living accepted lot under cp_handover_mass; subtract measured external tare/free water/ice/bands/packaging without subtracting native shell or natural retained body fluids. Count-to-mass conversion requires actual species/condition-matched measured sample, not universal individual weight. |
| energy_units | energy inventory | Net calorific value `93a60a56-a3c8-11da-a746-0800200c9a66` | MJ | Retain measured electricity and its supply identity; 1 kWh = 3.6 MJ. Fuel uses actual supplied mass and supported calorific/carbon evidence, not an invented universal kg-to-energy ratio. |
| physical_mass | physical ledger | Mass `93a60a56-a3c8-11da-a746-0800200b9a66` | kg | 1 t = 1000 kg; 1 g = 0.001 kg. Preserve wet/as-supplied, stock and material boundaries; unknown density/dry-matter or gas reference conditions are not silently converted. Match paired transfers at the same boundary and exclude recirculation throughput. |

## 5. System Boundary

### Boundary Abstraction

| Field | Value |
| --- | --- |
| declared_starting_condition | Documented wild marine Homarus capture context and responsible preparation/gear/bait supply, not purchased producer-gate bodies or farm seed. |
| starting_condition_role | Foreground removal from natural stock, with upstream supplied inputs and actual service responsibilities. |
| product_classification_scope | CPC 3.0:04331; narrower: wild live whole food Homarus only |
| recursive_input_rule | Purchased whole Homarus already past its first producer gate is resale and outside this capture PCR. Internal own-capture passes retain paired identities and burdens, not a recursively purchased final product. Purchased/own bait is a separate input purpose with its actual upstream dataset. |
| upstream_dataset_requirement | Actual bait/fuel/electricity/material/asset and service supplies must have matching origin/state/provider/unit, explicit embedded burden scope and current evidence. |
| disclosure | Declare actual lot/event graph, species/source, shell/live condition, gate, trip and return boundary, periods, services/asset users, grade/destination set, water/bait stocks and every evidence gap. |

### Boundary Rules

| rule_id | Applies to | Rule | source_ids |
| --- | --- | --- | --- |
| `gate_and_responsibility` | foreground boundary | Own actual wild capture through producer-responsible grading, bounded live maintenance/presentation and first food handover. Include responsible departure, bait/gear supply, capture, transfer and attributable return, idle, cleaning and asset service even after an at-sea gate; do not extend product handling beyond that gate. Purchased post-first-gate Homarus resale and merchant holding are excluded. | `noaa-american-lobster` |
| `state_graph` | all actual passes | Capture produces viable pending-grade animals; mandatory destination grading establishes actual food acceptance. Live maintenance and presentation may occur before or after grading and may repeat only with distinct event/pass ids and paired transfers. Pre-grade passes stay pending; post-grade condition changes require reinspection. Handover accepts only currently live, graded food lots, independent of the name of the last node. Unknown sequence/state is a gap, not a bypass. |  |
| `technology_delta` | capture | Declare actual capture parent gear. Trap/pot, net or other evidenced gear differ in deployment/haul equipment, energy, bait requirement, loss and bycatch/habitat/entanglement observations. Do not prescribe bait for unbaited gear. Different gear can coexist only on disjoint recorded events or responsibilities, not double-count the same animals. No universal impact, gear life or efficiency conclusion follows from a route label. | `noaa-american-lobster` |
| `water_and_service_boundary` | all nodes | Collect external supply, new self-abstraction and paired internal transfer separately; in-node recirculation is throughput, not a new exchange. Reconcile stock, measured discharge/treatment, product/accessory-carried free water, actual evaporation and ice melt without treating natural body fluid as external free water. Pure services use actual invoiced units in the auxiliary ledger and must resolve exact property/unit before final dataset exchanges; no fictional kg of service. Register inclusive scope and exclude embedded fuel/water/material or upstream emissions from duplicate direct rows. |  |
| `native_body_and_care` | all live states | Native shell, tissue and naturally retained body fluid define actual body mass; record species, molt/shell and missing-appendage condition without reconstructing absent parts. Bands, ice, free water and containers remain separate physical fates. Maintenance has no intended biomass production, fattening or induced molt; no immersion, feed or direct ice contact is universally required. Actual food-use authorization and live condition apply to the real place/time and cannot be inferred from a generic species page. |  |

## 6. Process Inventory Structure

Process-map order is a responsibility listing, not mandatory chronology. Declare actual production_mode: discrete capture-trip/lot batches, and continuous shared holding runs only where actually operated, with explicit run/period start and end. Record actual trip/lot/pass/event/transfer and shared holding run or service period; cleaning, changeover and no-output periods retain their owning campaign. Conditional nodes apply only when actually performed before gate. Every real cross-node handoff pairs actual state/mass, with one owner of shared quantities. Pure outsourced services, reusable-asset use and inventories that do not cross a material boundary remain explicit auxiliary ledgers in their actual units, with concrete exchange completion required before final dataset use.

### Process Map

| process_id | process_name | inclusion | inclusion_condition | role | quantitative_reference |
| --- | --- | --- | --- | --- | --- |
| `capture` | Wild capture and retrieval | required | Every included lot has an owned wild-capture responsibility; no purchased first-gate lobster resale. | foreground responsible activity | captured_live_unsorted; other actual intended catches |
| `grade` | Live condition and destination grading | required | Every final food lot has documented actual condition and destination acceptance. | foreground responsible activity | graded_live_food; actual alternative products and rejection destinations |
| `live_maintenance` | Bounded producer live maintenance | conditional | Actual producer-responsible live maintenance or nonfreezing cooling occurs before the gate, before or after grading as recorded; never deliberate grow-out, fattening or induced molt. | foreground responsible activity | maintained_live; mortality, actual alternative products and releases |
| `presentation` | Live restraint and protective presentation | conditional | Actual banding, protective containers or disposable packaging are applied under producer responsibility before handover. | foreground responsible activity | presented_live; packaging rejects and separately handed materials |
| `handover` | First producer food handover | required | Actual first transfer out of the producing fishery after final live-food acceptance; sea, quay or other actual producer gate. | foreground responsible activity | live_homarus_food_handover |

### Process: Wild capture and retrieval (`capture`)

Remove actual wild marine Homarus and incidental catch from the documented waterbody. Capture is independent from natural prior growth and subsequent grading or live maintenance. Include voyage departure, deployment, retrieval, producer-responsible transfer and attributable return to base, even after an at-sea product gate.

#### Inputs

###### Actual purchased treated industrial process water (`capture_treated_industrial_water`)

Only actual supplied treated industrial process water matching that technical role. It is not raw seawater, drinking-water certification, recirculation throughput or internal transfer.

## 7. Allocation and Co-product Handling

| rule_id | Applies to | Rule | source_ids |
| --- | --- | --- | --- |
| `physical_then_lca` | all inventory rows | Retain an unallocated actual physical ledger of inputs, products, paired transfers, stocks and losses. Assign shared resource-event/node/period ownership once, then normalize by positive accepted final native-body kg. Separately label the single-output LCA view, apply the relevant output attribution once, retain the original physical ledger and full allocation matrix. Never shrink physical partitions by economic shares, check an allocated mass against an unallocated closure or allocate an already attributed intermediate again. |  |
| `allocation_precedence` | actual intended outputs | Enumerate concrete accepted live grades and any other independently intended catch/bait/dead-food output with recipient and handoff; exclude disposal, live return, packaging accompaniment and internal recirculation from automatic coproduct treatment. First subdivide independently measured activity; then use evidenced causal physical consumption for inseparable joint resources; if not supported, use same-boundary same-period positive realized-value shares and disclose price basis and sensitivity. Missing value/causality is a data gap, not a default mass share or substitution credit. |  |
| `period_matrix` | trips, holding periods and assets | Index preparation, deployment, soak/retrieval, transfer, post-gate return, idle/cleaning, seasonal holding, acquisition, replacement and retirement. Link each actual event and output to a trip/lot/period; retain failed/no-output-period burdens in the campaign with relevant outputs, never divide by zero or drop failed trips. Assign actual asset service over its documented users/periods using evidenced time/use basis; no universal lifetime and no reset of full manufacture every trip. |  |
| `secondary_bait_attribution` | purchased_secondary_bait; own_bait_receipt | For actual secondary bait retain origin and the supplier declared prior-system burden inherited at its recovery handoff, plus nonembedded recovery/preparation/storage/delivery once. If the supplier documents an allocated valuable byproduct, inherit that allocation; if its justified waste-cutoff starts at recovery, disclose that boundary and include all recovery onward burdens. Do not add full original-fish burdens again or silently grant zero-burden residues. Competing cutoff interpretations are separate sensitivity scenarios, not simultaneous credits. Own-caught bait retains its own capture attribution once. | `fishres-secondary-lobster-bait-2025` |
| `shared_owner` | shared vessel, equipment, facility or service | Maintain a resource scope register covering actual capture, grade, live_maintenance, presentation and handover consumers and service periods. Shared vessel/hauler/gear, holding tank/cold room, reusable crates and outsourced inclusive services have one owning event and a documented causal time/use/space matrix. Exclude already embedded service resources and other periods shares; allocated reusable-asset manufacturing mass is not physical disposable packaging handed to the buyer. |  |

### Calculation Rules

| rule_id | Applies to | Formula or rule | Inputs | Output | source_ids |
| --- | --- | --- | --- | --- | --- |
| physical_normalization | all inventory rows | First close the unallocated actual physical node/pass stock and transfer ledger, assign shared resource ownership once, then divide attributable raw physical quantities by positive final accepted native-body kg for the physical per-reference view. Separately apply section 7 output attribution once for the labelled single-output LCA view, retaining original quantities and full matrix; physical partitions are never multiplied by economic shares. | actual raw quantity; accepted final native-body kg; event ownership; output matrix | physical per-reference amount; separately labelled single-output LCA amount |  |
| stock_closure | each actual node/pass | Opening stock + actual receipts = actual products/transfers + waste + environmental fates + closing stock, on consistent material boundaries. Keep native body, bait, accessories, water/ice and gear streams separate; document actual transformations and water carried with material without repeating component mass. No missing-balance plug or reconstruction of absent limbs. | actual receipts; stocks; outputs; paired transfer ids; transformations | unallocated reconciled quantities | `mass-balance-identity` |
| direct_emissions | actual direct emissions | Use measured emission mass or actual compatible consumed fuel × documented substance-specific factor with consistent factor units, compartment and carbon/oxidation basis; retain factor provenance and uncertainty. Refrigerant charge/recovery/leak records reconcile actual substance. No universal factors, upstream duplicate, or fossil identity for biogenic respiration. | actual fuel/emission/leak records; compatible independent factors and units | substance-specific direct mass |  |
| count_mass_conversion | actual item-count material records | Actual item count × measured same-material/specification/state item mass, or a documented representative sample with uncertainty; no universal lobster, packaging, band or asset weight. Keep accessory tare separate from native body. | count; matched item mass/sample; uncertainty | actual physical kg |  |

### Data Quality Requirements

| requirement_id | Applies to | Requirement | Evidence |
| --- | --- | --- | --- |

| quantitative_independence | every amount/range | Preserve original units, calibration, conversions, period coverage and uncertainty. Replace provisional screening with independent compatible evidence before calling numerical QA complete; no own-batch maximum or guessed zero. | raw measured records; independent campaigns/supplier study; documented unit and scope comparison |
| completeness_and_burdens | each event and actual service | Complete all physical fates, no-output resources, own/secondary bait, return/idle, shared assets and service-inclusive boundaries.

## 9. Validation Rules

| rule_id | Applies to | Rule | source_ids |
| --- | --- | --- | --- |
| `identity_scope` | reference and actual products | Require wild marine Homarus species, actual native-shell living whole food body, actual appendage/molt condition, source and first producer gate. Exclude spiny/rock lobster, Nephrops, crayfish, farming/fattening, detached parts, dead/frozen/cooked reference and nonfood seed/broodstock/ornamental use. Each concrete final exchange requires verified identity and supports. | `cpc3-wild-homarus` |
| `closure_and_sequence` | all node passes | Reconcile native-body and incidental biomass separately from water/ice/accessories and gear/bait, including opening/closing stocks, accepted alternatives, waste, live returns, actual mortality and environmental loss. Match transfer/pass ids and state history, never fixed 1 kg for upstream feed. Check actual grade before final food handover and reinspection after condition changes; unknown balance or sequence blocks quantitative completeness. |  |
| `quantity_and_ranges` | every active concrete exchange | Collect actual quantities before normalization; zeros require actual inactive role or measured zero, never missing data. Provisional reasoned ranges are screening hypotheses, not default amounts, empirical QA or legal acceptance. Evaluate each expanded identity and pass independently against external/supplier or independent campaign evidence with documented units, bounds and uncertainty; investigate values outside the provisional range without truncation. Never use a batch maximum to validate itself. |  |
| `attribution_and_route` | all resource and output owners | Check gear-event exclusivity/current evidence, actual production mode and periods, complete intended outputs/handoffs, period and shared allocation matrices, secondary bait inheritance and inclusive-service scope. Retain the unallocated physical ledger and one labelled single-output LCA derivation; no duplicate catch, fuel, internal water, own bait, resource ownership or second output share. |  |
| `trace_and_safety` | completed data package | Retain actual authority/market acceptance requirements and evidence appropriate to place/time without converting NOAA regional guidance into a global legal rule. Record viability, handling conditions and current release; cold maintenance does not resurrect dead bodies or reverse unsafe history. Complete protocol, identity, support, measurement and uncertainty evidence is required; checker success alone does not establish product safety or complete inventory. |  |
| `validate_inventory_completion` | all concrete exchanges and section 8 completion obligations | Verify each applicable dq_complete obligation has separately measured and identity-verified exchange cards. Check each quantity, native unit, range evidence, normalization, receiving medium, destination and non-duplication. Any unfulfilled actual child exchange, quantity, identity or destination makes the final dataset incomplete and fails validation; unknown cannot be zero. Static PCR checking does not replace this evidence. |  |

## 10. Published Dataset Profile

| Field | Value |
| --- | --- |
| dataset_role | Foreground wild live whole Homarus producer data package |
| downstream_use | secondary_dataset; background_dataset |
| allowed_use | Declared actual wild species/gear/gate live-food scope with complete quantities and verified concrete downstream identities. |
| excluded_use | Universal global lobster average; farmed/fattened/spiny/Nephrops/crayfish proxy without review; dead/parts/frozen/cooked products; proof of safety/sustainability; automatic ecosystem or avoided-bait credit. |
| required_metadata | Species, wild source, capture technology, event/lot/pass graph, actual live/shell/appendages, grade/food acceptance, first producer gate, periods/return, net-body method, intended outputs, service and asset scope, allocation matrices and actual concrete flow/support identities. |
| required_quality_disclosure | Unallocated physical and separate LCA views; calibration, completeness, quantitative/identity gaps, provisional ranges and uncertainty; supplier/secondary-bait inheritance and inclusive-service evidence. |
| update_trigger | Changed species/gear/gate/product condition, handling chronology, food requirements, bait origin, supplier scope, service/asset users, quantitative evidence or verified identities. |
