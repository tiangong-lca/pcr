# Farmed live whole sea-cage Atlantic cod

## 1. Scope and Applicability

This PCR covers Norwegian Atlantic cod (Gadus morhua) grown in marine net cages from purchased hatchery-origin juveniles, removed alive, sorted and delivered alive by wellboat to the first processor's physical receipt before slaughter. It defines a selected intermediate producer delivery gate, not a claim that all farmed cod is sold alive to retail. FAO describes hatchery-to-cage production and wellboat transfer to slaughterhouses; the first-party Norcod account corroborates the hatchery/fry-to-sea route. These sources support qualitative route choices only.

Exclude wild-caught juveniles or capture-based fattening, wild adult capture, other Gadiformes, wholly land-based growout, and references already slaughtered, bled, gutted, filleted or frozen. Downstream slaughter, packing of dead fish, retail, cooking and consumption are excluded. No universal feed conversion, stocking density, mortality, medicine, photoperiod outcome, cycle duration or transport temperature is imposed.

## 4. Measurement and Unit Rules

| rule_id | Applies to | Required property | Required unit | Rule |
| --- | --- | --- | --- | --- |
| reference_mass | reference product | Mass `93a60a56-a3c8-11da-a746-0800200b9a66` | kg | Weigh accepted whole live fish using a calibrated scale or traceable calibrated weighing record at physical receipt, excluding free carrier water and equipment tare; use cp_acceptance. |
| count_mass | cod_juveniles; cod_ready; harvest_cod; cod_collected; sort_cod; cod_sorted; delivery_cod; cod_processor_receipt | Mass `93a60a56-a3c8-11da-a746-0800200b9a66` | kg | Retain raw counts and representative lot-specific sampled live net masses, sampling design and uncertainty when counts are converted; no universal juvenile/adult count-to-mass factor. |

| substance_basis | collect_growout_aquatic; collect_growout_air; collect_harvest_releases; collect_sort_direct_releases; collect_delivery_releases; collect_delivery_air | Mass `93a60a56-a3c8-11da-a746-0800200b9a66` | kg | Declare chemical species and receiving medium; distinguish elemental nutrient from compound mass, fossil from biogenic carbon and carrier-water volume from added pollutant load. |

## 5. System Boundary

### Boundary Abstraction

| Field | Value |
| --- | --- |
| declared_starting_condition | Purchased live Gadus morhua juveniles from identified hatchery and nursery suppliers at farm receipt, with complete upstream burdens |
| starting_condition_role | Biological input boundary; not a burden-free origin |
| product_classification_scope | Selected hatchery-origin marine-cage Atlantic cod route within CPC 04242; the leaf also covers excluded products |
| recursive_input_rule | A same-category juvenile or live cod input retains species/state/gate and upstream dataset lineage; use a complete supplier dataset or explicit upstream submodel once, with cycle/duplicate checks |
| upstream_dataset_requirement | Hatchery, nursery, feed, energy, consumables, services, assets and delivery inputs require geography/technology/state-compatible upstream coverage; missing coverage is a disclosed data gap |
| disclosure | Declare actual hatchery origin, receipt gate, farm/cage/cohort and reporting years, service inclusions, asset boundaries, losses, stock carryover, allocations, uncertainty and all exclusions |

### Boundary Rules

| rule_id | Applies to | Rule | source_ids |
| --- | --- | --- | --- |
| boundary_route | cod_growout; cod_harvest; cod_sort; cod_live_delivery | Keep hatchery/nursery upstream on purchased juveniles. Foreground growout produces live fish in cages; independent harvest removes them alive; sorting separates accepted/downgraded/rejected destinations; preservation maintains live usability through wellboat delivery. | fao-cod-2010; norcod-sea-route |
| boundary_gate | cod_live_delivery | End at evidenced live physical processor receipt before any bleeding, gutting or slaughter; missing live gate evidence cannot default to this reference. | fao-cod-2010; cod-accounting-method |
| boundary_support | all inventory rows | Include actual growout equipment cleaning, support boats, harvest handling, live preservation and logistics. Do not invent a separate fish conditioning or product packaging operation for live tanks. Instantiate each actual support exchange at its consuming node. | cod-accounting-method |
| boundary_periods | cod_growout; cod_harvest; cod_sort; cod_live_delivery | Index juvenile receipt, marine cohort growth, partial harvests, deliveries, fallow/cleaning, failures, asset replacement and termination across all relevant reporting years. Opening/closing cohort inventories carry burdens forward without repeated allocation. | cod-accounting-method |
| boundary_shared | collect_growout_services; collect_harvest_services; collect_sort_services; collect_delivery_services | Maintain one shared ledger for cages/moorings, feeding systems, craft, wellboats and utilities, naming all consuming nodes, cohorts and service periods. Each node owns only its documented share; exclusive inclusive-provider and direct component ownership applies. | cod-accounting-method |
| boundary_generation | growout_electricity; collect_growout_fuel; harvest_electricity; collect_harvest_fuel; sort_electricity; collect_sort_services; collect_sort_direct_releases; delivery_electricity; collect_delivery_fuel | For on-site generation inventoried with its fuel and direct emissions, generated electricity is an internal energy transfer only: do not add purchased-electricity upstream burdens. Purchased electricity includes its supplier generation upstream once. Meter and distinguish imports, self-generation and transfers, with one generator owner and explicit fuel/electricity boundaries. | cod-accounting-method |
| boundary_losses | all inventory rows | Reconcile counts/biomass/feed with biological growth, intentional transfers, deaths, escapes and stocks; do not force juvenile mass to equal final mass. Ledger losses are not automatically waste or elementary exchanges. No ecological or nutrient-removal credit is assumed. | cod-accounting-method |

## 6. Process Inventory Structure

### Process Map

| process_id | process_name | inclusion | inclusion_condition | role | quantitative_reference |
| --- | --- | --- | --- | --- | --- |
| cod_growout | Marine cage growout | required | Selected hatchery-origin marine-cage route | Managed biological cohort production; batch/cohort and reporting-period indexed | Measured live biomass passed to harvest |
| cod_harvest | Live cage harvest | required | Actual live removal for delivery | Independent collection from production context, event/trip indexed | Live collected cod to sorting |
| cod_sort | Live grading and destination sorting | required | Actual destination decision before loading | Accepted grade, downgraded/return and reject state separation, lot indexed | Live accepted delivery lots and declared secondary states |
| cod_live_delivery | Live preservation and wellboat delivery | required | Selected live processor receipt channel | Maintain viable whole state through loading, voyage and acceptance | 1 kg accepted net live whole cod at processor receipt |

Cohorts may overlap in cages and reporting periods. Record actual operation mode and event boundaries rather than assuming one annual batch. Every transfer uses one id at both ends; internal product outputs are not additional final products. Enumerate every actual grade and destination. Multiple batch records may share one atomic card only when product identity, species, state, function, flow property/unit and exchange role are identical; a genuinely different product, state, use or receiving boundary requires its own card and independent quantity/identity evidence. No unrecorded secondary product is presumed.

### Process: Marine cage growout (`cod_growout`)

Incoming state: Purchased hatchery-origin live juveniles. Outgoing usable state/handoff: Live cod ready for cage removal. Record actual cohort, event and period; conditional cards are instantiated only from actual records.

## 7. Allocation and Co-product Handling

| rule_id | Applies to | Rule | source_ids |
| --- | --- | --- | --- |
| allocation_subdivide | all inventory rows | First attribute independently metered inputs and events to their node, cohort, lot and period. For this live-cod route, unresolved common operating burdens are assigned by documented causal service usage (metered power, vessel hours, cage occupancy/biomass-time as supported); disclose the selected driver and alternatives. | cod-accounting-method |
| allocation_outputs | collect_sort_secondary; collect_delivery_returns; cod_processor_receipt | Enumerate actual intended accepted grades, separately sold live downgraded fish and any other intentional outputs with physical handoffs. Use subdivision first; distribute remaining homogeneous live-cod joint burdens by accepted net live mass across intended sold grades, documenting why the mass driver fits this route. Different functions/states need a separate reviewed attribution decision. No default substitution credit. | cod-accounting-method |
| allocation_rejects | collect_growout_waste; collect_harvest_waste; collect_sort_waste; collect_delivery_waste | Rejects, mortalities and wastes are not automatically co-products. Their accountable production and treatment burdens remain with the responsible cohort/output; returned live stock carries its assigned burden once and is not counted as final sold mass. | cod-accounting-method |
| allocation_period | all inventory rows | Carry accumulated juvenile/growout burdens with surviving cohort stocks across year boundaries, assign partial harvests consistently and reconcile remaining stocks. Include failed cohorts, fallow support, cleaning and nonproductive services in the accountable ledger; disclose redistribution/terminal treatment rather than deleting them or allocating twice. | cod-accounting-method |
| allocation_assets | collect_growout_services; collect_harvest_services; collect_sort_services; collect_delivery_services | Use actual asset inventories, supported service lives, maintenance/replacement and service-use shares across named consumers/periods; shares exhaust the included burden once. No default lifetime. Inclusive purchased services and explicit fuel/power/capital/direct-emission components are mutually exclusive. | cod-accounting-method |

## 8. Foreground Data Collection, Calculation, and Quality Rules

### Data Collection Protocols

| --- | --- | --- | --- | --- | --- | --- | --- | --- | --- | --- | --- |
| cp_growout | cod_growout | Juveniles, feed, support inputs, grown biomass, wastes and releases | Supplier, meter, cohort and emission records | Species/origin; juvenile counts and sample mass; feed composition/moisture and stocks; cage/cohort/year; inputs; meters; asset/service id and shares; mortality/escapes; waste destinations; release species/medium and factor/model provenance | Reconcile purchase/feeding/stock records, calibrated meters and biomass samples; instantiate each conditional exchange separately; calculate substances only with compatible factors or measured concentrations/loads | kg; kWh; m3; each service native unit | Every receipt, feeding/accounting period and event | Full cohort and opening/closing periods including failed cycles | Named Norwegian farm, cages and suppliers | per 1 kg reference flow | Invoices; calibrations; sampling; supplier coverage; asset ledger; model/factor uncertainty |
| cp_harvest | cod_harvest | Removal, handling, fuel/services, collected live fish and losses | Trip/event and transfer records | Cohort; harvest event; transfer id; live entry/exit biomass/counts; fuel/power; service ownership; deaths/escapes; actual waste and direct-release species/medium | Pair cage-removal and sorting handoff records; meter actual owned inputs; retain incident and destination evidence | kg; kWh; each service native unit | Every harvest trip/event | All cohort harvests and failed removals in selected periods | Named cage and harvest craft | per 1 kg reference flow | Signed handoffs; scales; logs; service invoices; fuel/factor provenance |
| cp_sort | cod_sort | Live grading, accepted, downgraded, return and reject states ; actual direct substance releases| Lot/grade/destination records | Input/output transfer ids; live state; every actual grade/threshold; net masses/count samples; destinations; power; consumables/services; discard treatment ; direct fuel/activity and chemical identity; receiving medium; elemental/compound and fossil/biogenic basis; measured load or compatible factor/model; supplier exclusions; separately inventoried emissions| Match incoming collected lots to all destination states; obtain actual grade criteria and independently measured inputs ; measure actual direct releases or calculate from compatible recorded activity/factors, keeping one sorting owner and excluding duplicate supplier/separate burdens| kg; kWh; each consumable/service native unit | Every sorting lot and destination event | All accepted/rejected lots across selected cohorts/years | Named sorting location and recipients | per 1 kg reference flow | Grade tickets; weighing/sampling; recipient acceptance; waste receipts ; release measurements/factor provenance and uncertainty|
| cp_delivery | cod_live_delivery | Live preservation, voyage, owned inputs, service, returns, wastes and releases | Loading, vessel, live-state and discharge records | Lot; route/time; live loading/receipt; fuel/power/oxygen; actual water intake/reuse/return; temperature/oxygen observations; service inclusions; dead/rejected fish; discharge constituents/medium; equipment and cleaning events | Reconcile loading to physical receipt and losses; collect actual viability observations, meters and service inclusions; resolve individual conditional exchanges, with intake background separated from added loads | kg; kWh; m3; each service native unit | Every loading, voyage, discharge and receipt | Entire wellboat duty through first processor live receipt | Named vessel/route and receiving processor | per 1 kg reference flow | Voyage logs; live acceptance; meters; receipts; water sampling; factor/model provenance |

### Calculation Rules

| rule_id | Applies to | Formula or rule | Inputs | Output | source_ids |
| --- | --- | --- | --- | --- | --- |
| same_reference_normalization | all inventory rows | Divide each attributable actual exchange by accepted net live fish mass for the same accountable cohort/output scope; preserve raw native units and original quantities. Final reference equals accepted mass divided by that same accepted mass, not a yield estimate. | Node protocols; cp_acceptance; attribution ledger | Exchange amount per 1 kg reference flow | cod-accounting-method |
| cohort_reconciliation | cod_growout; cod_harvest; cod_sort; cod_live_delivery | Reconcile opening stock, purchases, biological growth, internal transfers, closing stock, intended outputs, deaths and escapes; retain counts and biomass evidence separately. Biological growth prevents a simple juvenile-mass-equals-final-mass identity. | Cohort/feed/transfer/acceptance and loss records | Traceable stock and burden carryover without duplicate transfers | cod-accounting-method |
| direct_release_calculation | collect_growout_aquatic; growout_fossil_co2; collect_growout_air; harvest_fossil_co2; collect_harvest_releases; collect_delivery_releases; delivery_fossil_co2; collect_delivery_air | Use compatible measured load/concentration-flow or documented fuel/feed substance-balance factors; retain substance, elemental/compound basis, medium, technology and uncertainty. Remove background and provider-inclusive overlap; no default release factor. | Node activity; measurements; factor provenance; service ownership | Individual actual substance loads on reference basis | cod-accounting-method |
| range_resolution | all inventory rows | Except the final 1..1 normalization identity, 0..U_row denotes an unresolved screening evidence need, never an observed or accepted empirical bound. For every instantiated exchange approve a separate U_instance in its own property/native unit and record evidence, reviewer and scope; aggregate bounds cannot cover mixed exchanges. | Actual exchange scope; node protocols; reviewed range evidence | Independent replaceable screening limits, or explicitly unresolved evidence | cod-accounting-method |

### Data Quality Requirements

| requirement_id | Applies to | Requirement | Evidence |
| --- | --- | --- | --- |
| quality_identity | all inventory rows | Match every actual exchange identity, state, gate, property, native unit, direction and destination; final dataset exchanges need verified concrete identities. | Supplier and receiving records; identity/support verification |
| quality_completeness | all inventory rows | Retain all inputs, support, services, wastes, emissions, failures and opening/closing stocks over complete cohort and service periods. Missing values are gaps, never automatic zero. | Cohort reconciliation and node coverage ledger |
| quality_uncertainty | all inventory rows | Disclose sampling, scale/meter, factor/model, temporal/geographic and upstream-data uncertainty. Every provisional upper bound remains unresolved until separately reviewed. | Calibration; samples; source applicability; uncertainty and bound decision records |
| quality_live_gate | cod_processor_receipt | Confirm actual viable whole fish physically accepted before slaughter; record live-state failure, rejection and returns independently. No universal survival, shelf-life or food-safety guarantee. | Signed physical receipt, state observations and timestamps |

## 9. Validation Rules

| rule_id | Applies to | Rule | source_ids |
| --- | --- | --- | --- |
| validate_scope | cod_processor_receipt | Reject wild-origin growout juveniles, other species/route, or fish slaughtered before receipt from this reference; require all qualifiers and upstream juvenile coverage. | fao-cod-2010; cod-accounting-method |
| validate_measurement | all inventory rows | Verify same 1 kg accepted net live mass basis, native-unit conversions, lot-specific count samples, water/tare exclusions and node-owned collection links. Final 1..1 is normalization identity only. | cod-accounting-method |
| validate_outputs | cod_sort; cod_live_delivery | Enumerate every grade/destination, accepted output, independently intended secondary product, return, reject and waste with handoff; reconcile transfers and prevent two final claims for one fish. | cod-accounting-method |
| validate_mode_period | all inventory rows | Check actual cohort/batch and overlapping reporting periods, input/output/cleaning/changeover events, partial harvests, failed cycles and opening/closing burden carryover once. | cod-accounting-method |
| validate_shared | collect_growout_services; collect_harvest_services; collect_sort_services; collect_delivery_services | Check every named asset/service consumer and period, causal driver, total shares, supported asset life/replacement and exclusive service/direct component ownership. | cod-accounting-method |
| validate_environment | all elementary rows | Require actual substance and receiving medium/basis, distinguish direct fossil carbon from respiration, and avoid waste/constituent or service-emission duplication; ambient seawater exposure and lost biomass are not automatic elementary exchanges or credits. | cod-accounting-method |
| validate_ranges | all inventory rows | Resolve independent U_instance bounds before treating ranges as empirical acceptance limits; missing quantity evidence or identities remains a gap even if structural checks pass. | cod-accounting-method |
| `validate_atomic_completion` | all applicable collection requirements and concrete inventory exchanges | Resolve every applicable section-8 collection requirement into individual physical/chemical exchanges with their own quantities, native units, composition/state, range basis or explicit uncertainty evidence, raw records, normalization, actual destinations/receiving media and verified compatible UUIDs. Any unresolved applicable requirement makes the final dataset incomplete and validation fails; unknown is not zero. Never copy aggregate amounts onto components or duplicate inclusive services with owned fuel/electricity/direct releases. Internal transfers are not fixed to the final 1 kg. | |
