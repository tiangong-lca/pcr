# Farmed whole chilled sea-cage gilthead seabream

## 1. Scope and Applicability

This PCR covers Greek Mediterranean marine net-cage growout of purchased hatchery juveniles of Sparus aurata, crowding and dip-net removal, actual ice-water killing/chilling, grade/destination sorting and actual presentation, ending with acceptance by the first physical recipient of the farmer’s product of whole chilled fish. Head, guts and native body remain; the product is raw and has never been frozen. Cage growout and crowd/dip-net harvest are distinct responsibilities: growth produces standing live biomass, physical removal produces collected live fish, and killing/chilling produces the chilled state. FAO documents the eligible route; producer sources corroborate a Greek whole-round fresh market, not any particular farm's operating conditions.

Exclude pond, lagoon, land-tank, wild-capture, vacuum-pump harvest, other species, live final delivery, gutted/scaled/gilled forms, fillets, cooked products, frozen/thawed products and post-recipient distribution/retail. Other actual technologies require a boundary review rather than a presumed equivalence. This is an inventory methodology, not a welfare, food-safety or current regulatory-compliance recommendation. No prescribed CO2 addition, temperature, fasting duration, shelf life, stocking density, growth duration, feed conversion ratio or survival is adopted.

## 4. Measurement and Unit Rules

| rule_id | Applies to | Required property | Required unit | Rule |
| --- | --- | --- | --- | --- |
| reference_net_mass | reference product | Mass `93a60a56-a3c8-11da-a746-0800200b9a66` | kg | Determine accepted net fish A by calibrated weighing and subtract measured ice, free water and tare at the same lot/gate; all rows use per 1 kg reference flow, based on actual attributable quantity divided by A. A must be positive. |
| juvenile_count_mass | received_juveniles; stocked_juveniles; growout_seed | Mass `93a60a56-a3c8-11da-a746-0800200b9a66` | kg | Keep observed count and mass independently. Convert count only with representative same-batch sampled individual mass and uncertainty; pre-stocking deaths are received but not stocked survivors. |
| native_carriers | all inventory rows | Actual row property | kg; kWh; t*km | Retain each material/substance native mass, metered electricity and transport load-distance. Record energy factors, density, active content and service scope before any physical conversion; do not confuse formulated product, elemental nutrient or active substance basis. |
| internal_handoffs | all inventory rows | Actual row property | actual native unit | Pair transfer ids and actual quantities; never force an internal fish transfer to 1 kg. All normalization denominators refer to the same final accepted lot A. |

## 5. System Boundary

### Boundary Abstraction

| Field | Value |
| --- | --- |
| declared_starting_condition | Purchased hatchery-reared live Sparus aurata juveniles physically received by the Greek marine-cage farm, with supplier nursery and transport scope declared |
| starting_condition_role | Upstream-complete biological input; receipt/stocking loss remains foreground; growout starts from surviving stocked fish |
| product_classification_scope | Semantic species/state/route/gate boundary above; CPC mapping is context, not production truth |
| recursive_input_rule | If the same category is purchased or transferred, retain actual state/gate and independently upstream-complete dataset; stop recursive foreground expansion at the declared supplier boundary without granting zero burden |
| upstream_dataset_requirement | Juvenile hatchery/nursery, feed, supplied materials/ice/energy, infrastructure and purchased services require compatible upstream datasets; disclose gaps and transport scope |
| disclosure | Declare cage/cohort/location, receiving gate, all periods/phases, transfers, support consumers, actual optional operations, input ownership, output destinations, exclusions and unresolved environmental/identity evidence |

### Boundary Rules

| rule_id | Applies to | Rule | source_ids |
| --- | --- | --- | --- |
| boundary_route | all processes | Separate managed cage growout, crowd/dip-net harvest and ice-water state change. Do not infer vacuum harvest, universal washing, mandatory gas addition or zero cage support energy. | fao-seabream-2009 |
| boundary_gate | first_receipt | End at first physical-recipient acceptance, which can be at farm or a farmer-served receiving site; an invoice or remote title transfer alone does not establish the gate. Include all actual transport/holding before that physical gate regardless of farmer or buyer responsibility; reconcile service scope and ownership to prevent omission or repetition. | |
| boundary_periods | cage_growout; shared_support | Link receipt, stocked cohort, growth, partial harvest, preparation/cleaning/changeover, idle/failed duty, replacement and decommissioning to actual periods. Closing live stock carries attributable burden forward; do not discard failed-cohort burdens or reassign them twice. | |
| boundary_pack | sort_destination; pack_present; first_receipt | Record actual packaging activation. Direct sorting-to-delivery bypass and packaged delivery preserve the same whole chilled final reference; measure the actual transfer once. Packaging is protection/presentation; distribution is owned by first_receipt. | |
| boundary_support | shared_support | One ledger owns vessels, cages, moorings, nets, tubs, feeders, pumps, cold facilities and actual utilities/services. Enumerate consuming nodes/cohorts/periods; exclude included fuel/assets/releases when a complete service is purchased. | |
| boundary_fates | all processes | Separate intended sale outputs, retained live stock, collected waste to actual treatment, direct resource intake and substance-specific environmental releases. Record actual destination/medium and treatment ownership; carrier water is not automatically waste or pollutant. | fao-seabream-2009 |

## 6. Process Inventory Structure

### Process Map

| process_id | process_name | inclusion | inclusion_condition | role | quantitative_reference |
| --- | --- | --- | --- | --- | --- |
| receive_stock | Juvenile receipt and cage stocking | required |  | foreground juvenile receipt and stocking | received and stocked juvenile mass |
| cage_growout | Marine net-cage growout | required |  | managed biological production | live harvest-ready biomass by cohort |
| crowd_harvest | Crowding and dip-net harvest | required |  | physical removal from cage | collected live whole fish |
| kill_chill | Ice-water killing and chilling | required |  | preservation and state transformation | whole chilled never-frozen fish |
| sort_destination | Grade and destination sorting | required |  | grade/destination classification | all declared accepted and other intended grade outputs |
| pack_present | Actual packaging and presentation | conditional | actual packaging or reusable-container presentation occurs before first physical receipt, regardless of operator; record burden ownership and exclude repeated service burdens | product protection/presentation, excluding distribution | whole chilled fish in actual presentation |
| first_receipt | Pre-receipt delivery and first physical-recipient acceptance | required |  | pre-gate logistics and final handover | accepted net whole chilled fish A |
| shared_support | Shared vessels, utilities and infrastructure | required |  | single burden owner for shared duties | actual node/cohort/period duty shares |

All node inventories use the same accepted-lot basis. Production is cage-cohort batch production with actual partial-harvest and operation-run indexing; concurrent cohorts and shared reporting periods remain separately traceable. Support is supplied once through the ledger, not duplicated as identical inputs at every consuming node. Each applicable Section 8 collection obligation must be instantiated independently for each actual material, service, destination or pollutant. A symbolic upper U_row_instance is an unresolved quantity in that instance's native unit; it is neither a unit nor an empirical default/cap. Zero requires evidence of absence, not missing records.

## 7. Allocation and Co-product Handling

| rule_id | Applies to | Rule | source_ids |
| --- | --- | --- | --- |
| attribution_output_set | all processes | Enumerate each accepted reference grade, other marketed grade/live sale, closing live stock and any actual intended recovery output with net quantity and physical handoff. Mortalities, unsold rejects and collected residues are wastes unless an evidenced intended product function and actual recipient justify another classification; no automatic substitution credit. | |
| attribution_precedence | cage_growout; sort_destination | First subdivide measured cohort/event/grade-specific duties. For irreducible same-species whole-fish joint growout or sorting burdens use actual net fish mass of all intended outputs at the common separation gate; carry grade-specific post-separation duty directly. Explain why mass represents physical production and test economic allocation when value differences materially change conclusions; disclose data and sensitivity, never choose retrospectively for a preferred result. | |
| attribution_period | cage_growout; shared_support | Index phases and periods, opening/closing live stock and partial harvests. Attribute measured use to cohorts; carry work-in-progress burden once into subsequent harvests. Use evidenced service-life and actual duty records for replacements/assets, including downtime, failed cycles and termination; no universal lifetime, survival or cycle yield. | |
| attribution_shared | shared_support | List every consuming node, cohort and period for each vessel, cage/net/mooring, tub, cold store or contracted service. Prefer meters and direct duty; otherwise use documented causal operating-hour, capacity-time or material-use shares. Reconcile shares to one owned burden, disclose idle/failed-duty assignment and sensitivity to a plausible alternative. | |
| attribution_no_duplicate | all processes | Pair physical transfers without a second upstream burden. Purchased complete services replace their included fuels/utilities/assets/direct releases; purchased ice includes its own production energy. Route each final lot through packaging or bypass once and do not count identical handoffs as separate sales. | |

For every actual direct release, retain foreground_record/collected_record only for a measured release. If the quantity is derived from fuel, concentrations, carbon composition or another activity record, use calculated_value/calculated_from_collection for that resolved instance and retain its explicit formula, factor/source, measured inputs, substance/medium basis and uncertainty under its own collection protocol. The collection-obligation template does not certify a calculated release as measured; no universal emission factor is supplied.

### Calculation Rules

| rule_id | Applies to | Formula or rule | Inputs | Output | source_ids |
| --- | --- | --- | --- | --- | --- |
| lot_normalization | all inventory rows | For each actual row instance, divide the attributable native quantity by the same positive accepted net fish A; retain raw quantities and attribution ledger. The accepted final same-lot fish amount is A/A = 1 kg. | Native quantity; share ledger; accepted net fish A; cp_first_receipt | Native row-unit quantity per 1 kg reference flow | |
| transfer_balance | all inventory rows | Reconcile paired transfers by event, lot, actual state and net quantity. Opening stock plus received/produced quantities equals intended outputs, remaining stock, recorded losses and separately evidenced fate terms within uncertainty; biological growth and nutrient flows require composition evidence, not a simple fish-mass-only equation. | Stock/transfer logs; composition; fate records; uncertainty | Reconciliation and unexplained residual | |
| conversion_evidence | all inventory rows | Count times representative same-batch mean individual mass yields fish mass; volume times measured source-appropriate density yields water mass; nutrient/active quantities use measured composition. Keep originals, conversion factor, temperature/basis and uncertainty; no generic species size or feed factor. | Counts; samples; measured volume/density; formulation and composition | Traceable physical-unit conversions | |
| release_accounting | collect_marine_nutrient_release; collect_chill_direct_releases; collect_actual_sort_water_release; support_fossil_co2; support_biogenic_co2; collect_support_other_releases | Derive each substance and medium from measurement or documented composition/fate model. Separate fossil and biogenic carbon, dissolved and gaseous fates, collected treatment transfers and direct releases; do not infer an elementary UUID or factor from an aggregate label. | Substance-specific records; fuel/carbon origin; retention and treatment data; model boundary | Substance/medium-specific releases and uncertainty | |
| release_evidence_mode | growout_escapes; fish_escape; support_fossil_co2; support_biogenic_co2; collect_marine_nutrient_release; collect_chill_direct_releases; collect_actual_sort_water_release; collect_packing_carrier_release; collect_delivery_carrier_release; collect_support_other_releases | For each actual direct-release instance, retain foreground_record/collected_record only when the raw release quantity is directly measured. If derived from fuel, concentrations, carbon composition or another activity record, use calculated_value/calculated_from_collection for that instance. Under its own collection protocol retain the explicit formula, factor and source/version where applicable, measured input records, substance/receiving-medium basis and uncertainty. Apply the stated attribution and reference-flow normalization once. Resolve the evidence branch before finalizing; missing method or supporting evidence remains incomplete, not zero. Existing foreground/collected metadata is the measured-branch template, not certification of calculated releases; no universal emission factor is supplied. | Instance-specific measured records; formula and factor/source/version if calculated; node protocol; attribution and accepted A | Release instance with method-consistent value/evidence metadata and traceable quantity | |

### Data Quality Requirements

| requirement_id | Applies to | Requirement | Evidence |

Provisional U quantities are evidence gaps and do not certify empirical plausibility. | Raw weighed/metered records; calibration; reviewable upper-bound derivation |
| dq_complete_fates | all processes | Enumerate intended sale grades, mortalities, escapes, leftovers, water intake/return, cleaning, actual additives, refrigerants, treatment and uncharacterized ecological pathways. Absence needs a documented check. | Output/destination ledger; substance analysis; missing-data register |
| dq_attribution | shared_support; cage_growout | Trace each shared consumer/period, failed duty, stock carryover, asset replacement and service scope; reconcile to totals without duplicated burdens. | Duty ledger; stock roll-forward; supplier scope and sensitivity |

Measure external abstraction, supplied water product, internal circulation and actual returned/discharged water separately; never deduct internal recirculation again from external intake. Net nutrient increment/retention is a separate balance diagnostic, never automatically a negative elementary flow, negative emission or avoided burden. | Actual load/vehicle duty records, service scope, same-lot water/substance balance and method evidence |
| `dq_atomic_card_identity` | all inventory rows | Each card represents one physically identified exchange, not a collection or selector. Keep Electricity as one electrical-energy flow; supplier, geography and voltage remain actual collected qualifiers, not grounds for speculative splitting. Other actual materials, waste streams, carbon origins and receiving media must have separate identities and atomic cards before completion. Preserve every existing collection obligation; an absent card or unresolved identity never means zero or a waived exchange. Paired internal water transfers retain the same actual quality, transfer id, quantity and upstream burden, without another purchase. | Per-card identity, provider, state, destination and paired records |
| `dq_atomic_range_evidence` | repaired atomic flow cards | U_row is an unresolved evidence requirement, not a numerical estimate, default, clipping limit or completeness pass. Establish each card's own matching-unit/reference-basis upper envelope from independent representative records or a compatible documented supplier/design bound, retaining scope, method and uncertainty. Do not reuse a removed aggregate range, copy a sibling quantity, derive a bound from the target batch itself or invent a value. Applicable missing evidence blocks quantitative QA completion; actual measurements remain required. | Independent envelope evidence; retained raw records and uncertainty |

## 9. Validation Rules

| rule_id | Applies to | Rule | source_ids |
| --- | --- | --- | --- |
| validate_reference | accepted_chilled_seabream | Require positive accepted net A, correct same-lot reference link/name, 1 kg final amount, all qualifiers and ice/water/tare exclusions; verify actual physical recipient and never-frozen condition. | |
| validate_route | all processes | Check all required nodes, cage-cohort production mode, independent harvest/chilling, actual packaging activation/bypass and complete ordered handoffs. Do not infer washing, universal CO2, zero support energy or another harvest method. | fao-seabream-2009 |
| validate_instances | all inventory rows | Match all actual instances to native units, independent U evidence, node-owned protocol and actual material/substance/destination/medium; unexplained absent data or invented numeric caps fail data completeness. | |
| validate_outputs | all processes | Check every intended grade/live sale and its handoff, unsold reject/treatment fate and direct release; do not count closing stock or one product twice at different gates. | |
| validate_period_support | shared_support; cage_growout | Reconcile cohort/run/period attribution, opening/closing stock, cleaning/changeovers, replacements/termination and idle/failed duty. Shares sum to the owned burden and purchased complete service scope excludes repeated inputs/releases. | |
| validate_environment | all elementary flows | Require exact pollutant or resource identity, basis and receiving medium; fossil and biogenic CO2 separated where known; unknown origin remains unresolved. Carrier water is not automatically pollution, treatment transfer is not a direct release, and uncharacterized escape/habitat effects remain disclosed. | |
| validate_projection | all processes | Align bilingual row/rule/protocol ids, actual state/property/unit/ranges, verified fixed identities and canonical projection. Report performed/skipped checks, identity gaps, unsupported factors and uncertainty; a structural pass does not establish external identity or publication readiness. | |
| `validate_atomic_completion` | all applicable per-flow collection obligations and final exchanges | Final dataset completion and validation require every actual exchange to have an independent atomic card and its own quantity, property/native unit, collection or calculation evidence, range/uncertainty evidence, normalization, actual destination and verified UUID. Unknown identity, activity state, quantity, range evidence or fate blocks completion; it is never zero, a presumed bypass or permission to omit an obligation. Every important concrete flow retains its own range/uncertainty evidence collection duty; a symbolic upper bound is not an empirical range. | |

## 10. Published Dataset Profile

| Field | Value |
| --- | --- |
| dataset_role | secondary_dataset; background_dataset after concrete foreground evidence and identity review |
| downstream_use | Foreground data package, process and lifecyclemodel projections of declared whole chilled fish supply |
| allowed_use | Matching species/route/state/gate and reporting period with disclosed representativeness |
| excluded_use | Other taxa/routes; live final product; gutted/filleted/cooked/frozen/thawed fish; edible-meat conversion; retail supply; welfare/safety/compliance certification |
| required_metadata | Required qualifiers; cohort/run/period; site; first physical recipient; actual net-mass method; all upstream boundaries; outputs/fates; support/period attribution; actual optional operations |
| required_quality_disclosure | Source applicability, historical route limitations, foreground coverage, provisional U evidence, identity gaps, uncertainty, allocation sensitivity and uncharacterized ecological effects |
| update_trigger | Species/route/gate/state, feed formulation, chilling method, actual packaging, support/service ownership, representative period, source or identity evidence materially changes |
