# Whole wild food flatfish at first producer handover

## 1. Scope and Applicability

This PCR covers actual wild-caught whole food flatfish delivered live, fresh or chilled at the first producer or collector handover. Whole means unheaded and ungutted fish, not fillets, meat or roe. One declared vessel/collector operating unit and traceable trip/campaign may contain multiple actual species or gear events; it is not a federated multisite average. Managed fish production, wild seed/feed/ornamental final use, gutted or headed fish, freezing and processed products are excluded. Actual first-gate location and responsibility control inclusion, not an assumed port. The official classification is broader than this whole-food first-gate boundary. [un-cpc3-flatfish]

| --- | --- | --- | --- | --- |
| `reference_mass` | reference product | Mass `93a60a56-a3c8-11da-a746-0800200b9a66` | kg | Weigh accepted net whole fish using a calibrated scale at the actual gate; exclude packaging, ice and extraneous water, not native organs or natural retained body fluids. Counts require same-species/state/grade measured samples, not a generic edible yield. |
| `energy_units` | electricity rows | Net calorific value `93a60a56-a3c8-11da-a746-0800200c9a66` | MJ | Preserve meter kWh and convert with 1 kWh = 3.6 MJ using the energy unit group; no kg conversion and no inferred fuel heating value. |
| `water_mass` | water and effluent rows | Mass `93a60a56-a3c8-11da-a746-0800200b9a66` | kg | Use direct mass or actual density with measured temperature/salinity for volume records; never force seawater, saline effluent or oxygen volume to water density. |

## 5. System Boundary

### Boundary Abstraction

| Field | Value |
| --- | --- |
| declared_starting_condition | Wild population and actual capture effort at a named waterbody; owned assets and purchased input upstream burdens included |
| starting_condition_role | Natural resource-to-catch foreground start, not managed biological production |
| product_classification_scope | CPC 3.0 04231 narrower whole-food first-gate methodology |
| recursive_input_rule | Purchased whole fish already past a first producer handover is outside this reference route and cannot be recursively relabelled own capture. Same-category fish purchased as bait is a separately identified supplier input with actual upstream capture and preservation burdens, not this reference product. |
| upstream_dataset_requirement | Compatible product supply state, location, technology and period for each purchased input or service; disclose omissions and substitutions |
| disclosure | Actual gate and ownership; capture technique/habitat; all active nodes and bypasses; state/stock transitions; asset periods; joint outputs and allocation; quantified evidence gaps |

| rule_id | Applies to | Rule | source_ids |
| --- | --- | --- | --- |
| `capture_primary` | capture; grade; preserve; presentation | This record starts with wild resource removal by the declared single operating unit, includes upstream burdens for purchased inputs and attributed assets, and ends at the actual first producer or collector handover. Natural reproduction is not a zero-priced hatchery operation. Purchased same-category fish already beyond its first producer gate is outside the reference route; actual purchased bait retains separately identified supplier capture and preservation burdens and is not this lot's own catch. | `foreground-flatfish-method` |
| `state_chain` | all lots | Every transfer retains species, observed live/fresh/chilled state, time, net mass, lot and pass id. Pre-sort preservation routes captured_unsorted through preserve_unsorted_in/preserved_unsorted to grade_catch_in; absence uses the direct same-state capture-to-grade edge. Post-grade preservation routes graded_food through preserve_fish_in/preserved_food to presentation_fish_in; absence uses the direct same-state grade-to-presentation edge regardless of earlier preservation. One pass produces one corresponding output; the two passes are not rework of the same completed output. Assign all intervention, mortality, water/ice stocks and losses to actual pass records, with capture-owned onboard fuel recorded once. Unknown sequence, state or food eligibility blocks finalization. | `foreground-flatfish-method` |
| `gear_delta` | capture | Declare bottom trawl, stationary/pound/gillnet, line or another evidenced technique as a capture-parent delta. Trawl records require bottom-contact track, duration, gear geometry and seabed context; passive nets require deployed area/length, soak and retrieval; lines require hook effort and actual bait. Multiple gears may coexist only as separate logged events; one event cannot be classified as two competing routes. Preserve current site evidence instead of extrapolating US summer-flounder performance, regulation or stock status to all flatfish. | `noaa-summer-flounder`; `foreground-flatfish-method` |
| `pre_gate_responsibility` | all nodes | All producer-owned activity actually before the first gate is included, including pre-gate shore movement, cleaning and bounded holding. Consumer distribution, filleting, heading/gutting, freezing, managed grow-out, seed/feed/ornamental final use and processing are outside the covered final product. A transshipment gate is the gate if that is the first actual producer handover; do not automatically add a later port stage. Distinguish product custody gate from resource/service accounting-period closure: an at-sea first gate is not moved to port, but actual trip-period ledgers assign necessary producer return-to-base, idling and return-cycle preparation once, with actual closure time and evidenced shares for other trips. Exclude buyer distribution and later unrelated capture; never charge the same return again to the next campaign. | `foreground-flatfish-method` |
| `ownership_closure` | all nodes | Assign one owner to vessel fuel, shore utilities, shared service events, external water, natural abstraction, ice manufacture, wastewater treatment and gear events. Vessel fuel in capture includes onboard preservation power; own ice inputs replace purchased ice production. External treatment/service inputs carry provider resources, not duplicated direct provider emissions. Track opening/closing fish, water, fuel, gear, refrigerant and reusable-container stocks. | `foreground-flatfish-method` |

## 6. Process Inventory Structure

### Process Map

| process_id | process_name | inclusion | inclusion_condition | role | quantitative_reference |
| --- | --- | --- | --- | --- | --- |
| `capture` | Wild capture and collection | `required` | Every declared wild capture trip or collection campaign | Source-to-collected catch; one vessel or collector operating unit | `captured_unsorted` |
| `grade` | Grade and destination sorting | `required` | Classify all collected lots into actual species, food grades and destinations; disclose inspection-only lots with no rejects | Complete destination partition; not a second capture operation | `graded_food` |
| `preserve` | Bounded holding and whole-fish preservation | `conditional` | Actual owned pre-gate holding/killing/chilling before sorting and/or after grading; record independent pass ids and same-state bypass for each absent pass | Observed usable-state intervention with stock and losses | per 1 kg final reference flow; measured preserved_unsorted for pre_sort and preserved_food for post_grade, each only in its actual pass |
| `presentation` | Presentation and first producer handover | `required` | Every final reference lot, whether bulk or packaged | Actual final state and net fish acceptance at first producer gate | `whole_flatfish_handover` |

### Process: Wild capture and collection (`capture`)

Capture independently removes organisms from the declared wild source; it is not managed reproduction. Record species and initial live/fresh state with removal time. Collected whole mixed catch routes directly to grade or through the actual pre-sort preservation pass; the preservation pass, not capture biology, owns chilling and resulting state/loss. The complete attributable producer trip, including outbound travel, search, deployment, hauling, onboard equipment, actual necessary return-to-base and idling after an at-sea first gate, has one capture fuel ledger. Product custody still ends at that first handover; later unrelated capture and buyer distribution are excluded. Sorting and preservation may overlap physically but transfer/pass records separate responsibilities and never duplicate quantities.

###### Collected whole unsorted catch at sorting handoff (`captured_unsorted`)

Measure whole mixed retained catch at the capture-to-next-responsibility interface with species estimates, observed initial live/fresh state, time and transfer id. Route to preserve_unsorted_in for an actual pre-sort preservation pass, otherwise grade_catch_in directly in the same state. This is not final output or fixed one kg; any subsequent chilling state belongs to the actual preservation pass, not capture biology.

### Process: Grade and destination sorting (`grade`)

Receive captured_unsorted directly or preserved_unsorted from actual pre-sort preservation, matched by transfer/pass id and observed state. Food-qualified flatfish of each grade proceed directly to presentation or to an actual post-grade preservation pass. Other intended species/non-food sales, live release, direct environmental discard and managed waste have separate destinations. Every collection scope expands to independently identified actual exchanges; no universal mixed-species UUID is asserted.

###### Food-qualified whole flatfish by accepted or downgraded food grade (`graded_food`)

Record every accepted or downgraded food grade by species, observed live/fresh/chilled state and transfer. Send to preserve_fish_in only for an actual additional post-grade preservation pass; otherwise to presentation_fish_in directly in the same state, even if pre-sort preservation already occurred. Food acceptance is independently evidenced; incompatible state lots remain separate.

### Process: Bounded holding and whole-fish preservation (`preserve`)

This one preservation responsibility may have a pre-sort pass (preserve_unsorted_in -> preserved_unsorted -> grade) and a post-grade pass (preserve_fish_in -> preserved_food -> presentation). These are distinct chronological pass records, not a fictitious rework loop or both outputs for one pass. Actual timing determines which pass occurs; capture -> onboard chill -> landing grade -> dispatch is supported without inventing initial sorting. The pre-sort output is unqualified mixed catch; grade owns its eventual food acceptance or destination decision. Already fresh catch needs no invented kill. Live cooling is not death; mortality and deliberate killing are separate observations. Each pass owns all holding resources, water/ice stocks, releases and losses once, while capture owns all onboard fuel/generation. Bounded maintenance may include documented feed but excludes intentional growth/fattening. Unknown actual sequence/state/food eligibility blocks finalization.

###### Water actually evaporated from owned holding and chilling (`preserve_evaporated_water`)

The bound identity represents emissions to air, unspecified. Where actual evidence identifies a more specific air subcompartment, verify and select the corresponding identity before finalizing the dataset. Record measured or independently evidenced evaporation when material to water balance; exclude internal circulation and undocumented balancing plugs.

### Process: Presentation and first producer handover (`presentation`)

First-gate presentation receives graded_food when post-grade preservation is absent, or preserved_food when a post-grade pass actually occurred; pre-sort preservation may still have occurred in either route. Match one last upstream source, observed state and measured quantity. No killing/chilling is silently assigned to this gate. Continuing holding resources/losses remain owned by a matched preservation pass through the actual gate; presentation does not own a duplicate holding event. Bulk or packaged presentation records actual package materials/reuse separately; distribution after first handover is outside.

## 7. Allocation and Co-product Handling

| rule_id | Applies to | Rule | source_ids |
| --- | --- | --- | --- |
| `subdivide_first` | all shared burdens | First subdivide physically separable gear events, species-directed trips, node meters and independently supplied services using observed records. Do not allocate a common vessel trip twice as capture and a transport service. | `foreground-flatfish-method` |
| `intended_output_set` | grade_other_intended_products; preserve_nonfood_sale; presentation_nonfood_sale | Enumerate all independent intended species/food-grade/non-food sale outputs and actual handover gates. For irreducible joint capture burdens, use an evidenced physical causal relationship where demonstrable; otherwise disclose an economic allocation using actual same-period ex-gate net revenues of every intended output. Record rationale, prices, quantities, uncertainty and mass-based sensitivity. Do not use economic allocation when causal subdivision is evidenced. Rejects, releases and waste are not intended sale outputs merely because they have mass; treatment burdens remain with generating operations and there are no automatic substitution credits. | `foreground-flatfish-method` |
| `period_assets` | capture_assets; preserve_assets; presentation_returnable_assets | Index trips/campaigns, maintenance/idle periods, holding across cutoffs and final gate lots. Attribute assets by observed service/usage over declared build, operating, replacement and termination periods; disclose residual capacity and decommissioning. Link opening stocks to prior-period burdens and closing stocks to future outputs without charging both. Never assume a universal vessel, net or crate life. | `foreground-flatfish-method` |
| `shared_consumers` | capture; grade; preserve; presentation | Keep a shared-asset/service ledger listing the vessel or site asset, every consuming node and period, measured causal driver and shares summing to one. Vessel manufacture/fuel have capture ownership; present their allocation across all fish sale outputs rather than booking a full asset in each downstream node. Shore shared assets and cleaning/changeover events use metered or causal usage; record any fallback and sensitivity explicitly. Never add both an external service and its complete resources. | `foreground-flatfish-method` |

Assign shared resource/service events to actual consuming nodes and periods once using evidenced service shares, without shrinking product, biomass, water or waste partitions by a co-product share. Divide this physical inventory by the matching positive accepted final net kg. Separately derive a labelled single-output LCA burden/inventory projection using section 7 co-product allocation exactly once, retaining the unallocated inventory and allocation matrix. Never test allocated exchanges against an unallocated physical balance, apply output shares again downstream, or set an internal quantity to the final 1 kg. | event records; share drivers; final accepted net kg | amount per 1 kg reference flow | `foreground-flatfish-method` |

| --- | --- | --- | --- |
| `dq_identity` | all lots | Species/state/food eligibility and actual first-gate ownership must be explicit; do not infer from CPC or a broad flow label. | Traceable species/catch/custody and acceptance records |
| `dq_effort` | capture | Represent complete trips, seasonal conditions, gear coexistence, return/idling and incidental catch; disclose missing observers, spatial coverage and uncharacterized ecological effects. | Trip logs; tracks; gear and species observations |
| `dq_balance` | all nodes | Document stock and transfer closure with uncertainty and non-zero unresolved residuals disclosed; no invented balancing flows. | Calibrations; matched transfers; opening/closing inventory |
| `dq_quantitative` | all amounts | Collect actual amount evidence.

## 9. Validation Rules

| rule_id | Applies to | Rule | source_ids |
| --- | --- | --- | --- |
| `v_scope` | reference product | Reject final lots that are not verified wild whole unheaded ungutted food flatfish at the first producer handover. Declare actual species/taxonomy, waterbody/marine-inland origin, gear, food grade, live/fresh/chilled state, intervention, time, actual gate and stock period. CPC04231 is only narrower mapping context, not proof of full code coverage. | `un-cpc3-flatfish`; `foreground-flatfish-method` |
| `v_state` | all transfers | Test capture -> pre-sort onboard chill -> landing grade -> dispatch; direct live/fresh capture -> grade -> dispatch; and post-grade preservation, including both-pass cases with unique pass ids. Match every actual transfer/state/quantity and same-state absent-pass bypass. Pre-sort output is not automatically food-qualified. Already fresh fish needs no invented kill; live output excludes dead fish. Dead fish needs independent fresh/chilled food acceptance or reject fate. No duplicated intermediate output, resource, mortality or stock between passes; internal feed is measured, never fixed to final one kg. | `foreground-flatfish-method` |
| `v_complete` | all nodes | Close species/body-mass partitions, intended outputs, releases/discards/waste, water and pollutants, fuel, gear, refrigerant and packaging stocks within documented measurement uncertainty. Retain bottom-contact/entanglement/incidental-catch condition and effort evidence even where no characterized LCA factor exists; missing characterization is disclosed, not reported as zero ecological impact. | `foreground-flatfish-method` |
| `v_range` | all flow cards | Every Range is an explicit provisional screening envelope unless it is the exact final reference quantity. Non-reference envelopes are not allowed ranges, site observations, default inventory values or evidence of plausibility. A value outside the envelope triggers investigation, not clipping; a value inside does not validate the batch. Replace provisional screens with independently held-out reviewed campaign evidence before quantitative reuse, without using the evaluated batch maximum as its own guardrail. | `foreground-flatfish-method` |
| `v_identity` | all exchange identities | Resolve each actual collection scope exchange to one verified compatible flow before downstream exchange publication. Verify direction/type, substance or product state, property/unit, geography, technology and destination independently. No UUID observation establishes an amount or emission factor. Unverified oxygen, fuel, final fish, wastes and emissions remain unresolved; do not relabel a narrower freshwater diesel or factory oxygen reference. | `foreground-flatfish-method` |
| `v_attribution` | all periods and outputs |Reconcile every intended output and revenue/physical driver across the same system period, every shared-consumer share and opening/closing stock burden. Check that outbound/return effort, onboard preservation energy, manufactured/purchased ice, purchased services and direct emissions are counted once. Missing route-specific effort, release condition, stock fate or allocation evidence prevents a complete foreground package. Check the at-sea gate case explicitly: separate product custody from completed producer return-service accounting, with return burdens assigned once without moving the product gate. | `foreground-flatfish-method` |
| `validate_inventory_completion` | all concrete exchanges and section 8 completion obligations | Verify each applicable dq_complete obligation has separately measured and identity-verified exchange cards. Check each quantity, native unit, range evidence, normalization, receiving medium, destination and non-duplication. Any unfulfilled actual child exchange, quantity, identity or destination makes the final dataset incomplete and fails validation; unknown cannot be zero. Static PCR checking does not replace this evidence. |  |
