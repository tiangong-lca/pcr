# Conversion of fluff-pulp/SAP disposable taped baby diapers

## 1. Scope and Applicability

This PCR covers converter-gate manufacture of unused, fluff-pulp/sodium-polyacrylate disposable taped baby diapers. The representative actual product design is the fragrance-free US Pampers Swaddlers taped diaper, size 4; manufacturer construction and fastening instructions support the component boundary, not a verified proprietary factory recipe. Apply to a concrete measured lot with its actual component specification. The required design contains PP/PE topsheet, polyester acquisition layer, ECF-purified cellulose/SAP core, PE/PP outer cover, PP cuff and fastening components, elastane, polymer adhesive, balm and wetness indicator. No per-diaper mass, recipe fraction or absorption capacity is prescribed. [pampers-swaddlers-construction; pampers-diaper-components]

The method is a purchased-component, electrically powered dry defibration/forming, assembly and pack-out route. Wet pulping, integrated pulp production, on-site combustion, purchased heat/steam, solvent coating/printing and on-site effluent treatment require a separately evidenced route extension. Purchased printed/coated components retain their embedded material burdens upstream. Sanititary pads/tampons, adult incontinence products, cloth/reusable diapers, swimming diapers, pull-on pants and fluff-free cores are outside this methodology.

## 3. Reference Flow

| Field | Value |
| --- | --- |
| What | Manufacture a specified complete taped baby diaper designed to contain infant excreta |
| How much | 1 kg accepted complete net diaper product; this is a manufacturing declared unit |
| How well | Declared actual size, component specification and lot acceptance tests; no generic absorption or leak-protection equivalence |
| How long or cycle | One manufacturing cycle to converter gate for a single-use product; use duration is outside the unit |
| reference_flow_link | `diaper_output` |

| Field | Value |
| --- | --- |
| Reference amount | 1 |
| Reference product flow | Sanitary towels (pads) and tampons, napkins and napkin liners for babies and similar articles, of any material `aaedb37f-8a1a-4dea-aa96-3613fa13bb0e` |
| Reference flow property | Mass `93a60a56-a3c8-11da-a746-0800200b9a66` |
| Reference unit group | Units of mass `93a60a57-a4c8-11da-a746-0800200c9a66` |
| Reference unit | kg |
| Required qualifiers | Taped baby diaper; size and lot; complete BOM; pulp and SAP identity; material and supplied-state of each component; actual net moisture; fragrance/lotion/indicator state; accepted QC protocol/results; all-electric converter route and supply voltage; packaging exclusion; provider dataset bases; site/year; external waste and emission routes |

The broad reference record includes baby diapers and specifies finished manufactured product at plant. Its other subcategories do not define this PCR. Every concrete dataset must declare the qualifiers above; mass equivalence alone does not establish functional equivalence across sizes or products.

## 4. Measurement and Unit Rules

| rule_id | Applies to | Required property | Required unit | Rule |
| --- | --- | --- | --- | --- |
| `reference_mass` | `diaper_output` | Mass `93a60a56-a3c8-11da-a746-0800200b9a66` | kg | 1 kg complete net accepted diapers at dispatch moisture. All inventory and collection aggregation use this same reference_flow basis. Do not substitute pure pulp/SAP mass or include packaging. |
| `net_batch_basis` | All inventory rows | Mass | kg | Collect raw Q by cp_output and raw external period totals A_i on the same complete pool. The expressions q_i=A_i/Q on inventory cards denote the single normalize_net_product calculation; they do not instruct another division. Counts corroborate measured net mass and never establish an assumed item weight. |
| `received_pulp_basis` | `fluff_pulp` | Mass | kg | Keep measured as-received mass and dry-solids fraction s separate. Supplier AD reporting is a declared convention, not received moisture. Verify conversion and background reference basis before linking. |
| `electric_energy_basis` | `grid_electricity` | Net calorific value `93a60a56-a3c8-11da-a746-0800200c9a66` | MJ | Convert delivered kWh to MJ by 3.6 only. Preserve supplier voltage/mix and losses; internal step-down losses are in foreground consumption if inside the gate, not an extra purchased electricity input. |

## 5. System Boundary

### Boundary Abstraction

| Field | Value |
| --- | --- |
| declared_starting_condition | Purchased pulp sheets and individually declared components at converter receipt; actual supplier grade/state/route and inbound freight boundary disclosed |
| starting_condition_role | foreground_module |
| product_classification_scope | CPC32196 taped infant-diaper subset only; method is independent from the classification label |
| recursive_input_rule | No recursive diaper manufacturing for purchased completed diapers: record the actual input and compatible upstream dataset, disclose refurbishment/rework. Internal rework remains internal; do not purchase the same rejected unit again. |
| upstream_dataset_requirement | Supplier-specific component manufacture and transport consistent with reference properties; for pulp include actual wood sourcing, kraft pulping/recovery, ECF bleaching, drying and wastewater treatment. Use BREF only for relevant pulp process/reporting context, not a lumber dataset or a diaper recipe. |
| disclosure | Converter module versus cradle-to-gate aggregate; geography/year; complete component BOM; supplied subassembly states; actual product moisture; utility and treatment boundaries; all exclusions and gaps |

| rule_id | Applies to | Rule | source_ids |
| --- | --- | --- | --- |
| `boundary_complete` | `conversion` | Include receipt/handling, dry defibration, SAP dosing/core forming, web and film assembly, elastics/fasteners, actual coating, cutting, inspection/rejects, pack-out, dust collection and attributable electric auxiliaries. Explicitly retain upstream burdens for every input; do not present a converter module as a full lifecycle result. | pampers-swaddlers-construction; ea-nappies-2008; pampers-manufacturing-traceability |
| `upstream_pulp_boundary` | `fluff_pulp` | Purchased pulp manufacture is upstream, including recovery/boilers and mill treatment. Supplier wet/AD/oven-dry bases must be reconciled with received mass. Do not bring sawmill evidence into pulp process quantities. Retain upstream biogenic CO2 exchanges and carbon origin even if a climate reporting convention excludes them from a subtotal. | jrc-pulp-paper-bref-2015 |
| `physical_network` | `conversion` | Aggregate manufacture and packaging into one foreground unit so the same complete product is output only once. Retain stage meters and a separate physical process diagram/balances. Each internal transfer has equal mass/identity at both ends; pair stage internal_out and internal_in with the same transfer ID, time, owner/cohort and complete inherited provider vector. Actual transformation consumes its incoming material and records resulting outputs/losses, without creating a fictitious receipt of that transformed material; internal recirculation and collected return are not external exchange or credited waste. | ea-nappies-2008 |
| `actual_air_path` | `conversion` | Inspect dry defibration/core-forming/cutting exhaust and fugitive pathways. BREF7.1.10 establishes possible paper-cutting dust, not a diaper/SAP factor. Keep capture and external particulate emission separate and measured; classify size and composition without correction flows. Additional actual volatilized species need separate verified elementary rows before dataset completion. | jrc-pulp-paper-bref-2015 |

## 6. Process Inventory Structure

### Process Map

| process_id | process_name | inclusion | inclusion_condition | role | quantitative_reference |
| --- | --- | --- | --- | --- | --- |
| `conversion` | Purchased-component diaper conversion and pack-out | required | Declared electrically powered dry route | foreground | 1 kg accepted complete net diapers |

Physical stages: receipt → dry pulp defibration → metered pulp/SAP core forming → web/film/fastener/elastic/actual-coating assembly → cutting → QC → retail and shipping pack-out. Dust collection and internal rework link to their actual stage. Stage quantities remain auditable even though the external unit is aggregated. Conditional cards are used only for the actual lot; absent cards require documented absence, not a missing-data zero. Formulations and supplied finished webs are single real product exchanges; never use a component bundle in place of separate materials physically received.

### Process: Diaper conversion and pack-out (`conversion`)

#### Inputs

##### Product flows

###### Delivered fluff pulp (`fluff_pulp`)

Delivered ECF-bleached, non-dissolving chemical fluff pulp sheets for dry defibration. Record actual grade, kraft route, producer, as-received moisture and delivery mass. A broad non-dissolving pulp identity is usable only with these qualifiers; it does not select a supplier dataset or a universal dry-matter factor.

###### PP outer facing web (`outer_facing`)

Delivered PP nonwoven outer facing; record print/finish mass within the actual supplied grade. It is separate from the PE backsheet in this route. A purchased PE/PP laminate must instead be represented by its real one-piece input identity before using this dataset.

- Selected flow: Non-woven fabric `6b35ed69-0eb9-4c4a-902e-bdc43eeef146`

- Collection protocol: `cp_material`
- Sources: pampers-swaddlers-construction

###### Polyester acquisition layer (`acquisition_web`)

Delivered polyester nonwoven acquisition/distribution web. Confirm whether the supplied grade includes PE binder fibres or other constituents; the polyester identity is conditional on an actually polyester web and a compatible supplier inventory.

Require supplier proof of actual nonwoven polyester construction and compatible reference basis; a different quilted/composite construction requires identity review.

###### Nonwoven core wrap (`core_wrap_nonwoven`)

Conditional: one actual nonwoven core wrap web, with polymer grade and bonding declared. This construction detail is not disclosed for every Swaddlers lot; establish it by supplier BOM/disassembly. Do not add this row merely because another product has a wrap.

- Selected flow: Non-woven fabric `6b35ed69-0eb9-4c4a-902e-bdc43eeef146`

###### Cellulose tissue core wrap (`core_wrap_tissue`)

Conditional: actual purchased cellulose tissue wrap, if used in the declared lot. The historic UK nappy description supports this possibility, not a current Swaddlers default. Disclose whether it replaces or accompanies the nonwoven wrap and meter each physical web once.

- Selected flow: Toilet or facial tissue stock, towel or napkin stock and similar paper, cellulose wadding and webs of cellulose fibres `3070a34a-8d40-426e-9299-7c367b0dca21`

###### Printed PE barrier film (`backsheet`)

One delivered PE barrier film grade including its supplied fillers, print and finish. Verify actual PE chemistry/CAS9002-88-4, film state, porosity and provider; this UUID carries an inconsistent external classification, so physical identity alone is retained conditionally. The supplied pigment solids are inside this input, not a second fictitious pigment purchase.

- Selected flow: Polyethylene film `e64eb06c-6dc9-45f1-b003-3dc6c44b27e2`
- Flow property / unit: Mass `93a60a56-a3c8-11da-a746-0800200b9a66` / kg

- Evidence kind: Calculated from collection (`calculated_from_collection`)
- Collection protocol: `cp_material`
- Sources: pampers-swaddlers-construction

###### PP mechanical fastening tab (`hook_fastener`)

One actual PP mechanical hook tab grade, excluding a separately delivered PE carrier. Record its mass, receiving state and supplier manufacture; PP resin or filament is not a finished hook tab.

The broad plastic-product identity locates this one actual finished PP mechanical hook component, not PP resin, a collection of fasteners or a metal part. Require the actual hook geometry, PP/additive composition, supplied subassembly state, process and compatible supplier reference mass; no molding route or fastening performance is inferred.

- Selected flow: Commodity plastic products `5b5f649d-db2b-426c-9bd2-aff11fce2e3a`

- Collection protocol: `cp_material`
- Sources: pampers-swaddlers-construction

###### PP nonwoven landing strip (`landing_web`)

Conditional on a separately delivered PP nonwoven landing strip. Record actual fastening-compatible web grade and coatings; a supplied complete fastening assembly is one real input instead and requires its own identity.

- Selected flow: Non-woven fabric `6b35ed69-0eb9-4c4a-902e-bdc43eeef146`
- Flow property / unit: Mass `93a60a56-a3c8-11da-a746-0800200b9a66` / kg

- Collection protocol: `cp_material`
- Sources: pampers-swaddlers-construction

###### PE fastening-tab carrier film (`tab_carrier`)

Conditional on PE carrier film delivered separately from the PP hook. Record the PE grade and adhesive already present. Exclude this separate row when the complete fastening tab is purchased as a single component.

Verify actual PE-film grade/composition, CAS9002-88-4 and supplier physical/reference state; the unresolved source metadata does not establish a compatible delivered background.

- Selected flow: Polyethylene film `e64eb06c-6dc9-45f1-b003-3dc6c44b27e2`

- Collection protocol: `cp_material`
- Sources: pampers-swaddlers-construction

###### Elastane elastic strand (`elastic_strand`)

Actual elastane strands for leg/waist fit, not natural rubber. Confirm the polyether-polyurea copolymer identity described by the selected record and actual strand form with the supplier; a different elastomer chemistry requires a different identity.

Require actual continuous elastic-strand form and supplier/source confirmation that the broad fibre identity applies, with the declared chemistry and delivered mass; mixed fabric/staple metadata does not establish strand manufacture. If the source is limited to fabric or staple fibre, a compatible strand identity is required.

- Selected flow: Spandex `b722c9ee-6aa7-46ec-ba55-bde79502aaca`

###### Solid thermoplastic construction adhesive (`construction_adhesive`)

One purchased solvent-free thermoplastic hot-melt construction adhesive grade. Supplier proof of this physical route is required: the producer only discloses polymer adhesives, not every proprietary grade. If the actual glue is reactive or waterborne this row is unavailable. Measure glue issue/returns and incorporation/purge separately.

Require the actual entire supplied solid, solvent-free, reversibly softened thermoplastic formulation and compatible provider mass; no vulcanization, rubber article or chemical curing is inferred.

- Selected flow: Hot melt adhesive `3ec33f9f-92dd-487a-a0d9-b177c926b8f0`
- Flow property / unit: Mass `93a60a56-a3c8-11da-a746-0800200b9a66` / kg

###### Solid thermoplastic elastic attachment adhesive (`elastic_adhesive`)

Conditional: a second, separately supplied hot-melt adhesive grade for elastics. If one grade serves both roles, partition the single metered issue into disjoint role totals rather than duplicating it. Chemistry/provider conditions are the same as construction_adhesive.

The same actual solid thermoplastic formulation and provider-state requirements apply; role subdivision never duplicates one physical adhesive purchase.

###### Topsheet emollient coating formulation (`emollient`)

One actual purchased emollient/balm formulation applied to the topsheet. Record product name, complete composition, solids, lot and incorporation mass. Producer disclosure confirms the balm, but does not disclose a complete recipe; do not assume petrolatum, stearyl alcohol or aloe. Absent as an on-site input for pre-coated topsheet.

The broad functional Coating identity represents the complete actual supplied balm coating, not a pure ingredient. Record delivered phase, full supplier formulation/SDS, water/volatile/solid fractions and delivery versus incorporated mass before background linkage. Separate actual application charge, retained amount, stock/return and purge; no chemical recipe or coating temperature is defaulted.

###### Wetness-indicator formulation (`wetness_indicator`)

One actual delivered pH-sensitive wetness-indicator formulation with a water-soluble colorant. Record product/colour chemistry, carrier, solids and application route from the provider. It is neither the generic construction adhesive nor an inferred pure dye. If already included in purchased film, count it in that film only.

The broad functional Coating identity represents this separately supplied complete pH-sensitive indicator coating. Verify actual supplied formulation/SDS, phase, colorant/carrier chemistry, water/volatiles/solids, application and compatible supplier mass; absent raw CAS does not verify a particular colorant. Charge, retained coating and independent purge remain separate measured accounts, without imposing a hot-melt, aqueous or solvent recipe.

###### Corrugated shipping carton (`pack_carton`)

One real corrugated transport box grade. Record actual fibre mix, print, provider and mass; do not impose the candidate database box recipe of 16.6% virgin/83.4% recycled fibre.

The broad packaging record positively includes corrugated cases; use it only for this one actual delivered carton, never an aggregated bag/carton/wrap bundle. Require actual fibre composition, board construction, print/glue, moisture, grade and supplier/plant-gate mass compatibility. No 16.6%/83.4% fibre recipe or generic-world supplier dataset is adopted.

The selected UUID retains the official native name Packaging materials, unspecified; Corrugated shipping carton is the concrete single-component display within that disclosed family.

###### Purchased medium-voltage electricity (`grid_electricity`)

Conditional on actual 1–35 kV grid-average supply to the user. Meter the delivered supply point, including electric defibration, forming, bonding/heating, compressed air, HVAC, inspection and packaging within scope. Retain this record’s Net calorific value property label/MJ; kWh-to-MJ conversion by 3.6 does not select a geographic mix or prove a different voltage. Record supplier, year and loss boundary; use a different verified identity for a different delivery voltage.

The raw CN supply geography and MV grid-average consumption mix do not default the actual site country or background. Require actual site/country/year/provider and voltage/loss-boundary compatibility before linkage.

###### Purchased tap water for cleaning (`cleaning_water`)

Conditional: externally supplied tap water for actual converter cleaning and relevant auxiliaries. This dry converting route has no pulping or wet forming water. Measure supplied kg or convert metered m3 using measured site density; the broad physical identity does not identify a local waterworks dataset.

###### Aqueous neutral cleaning detergent formulation (`cleaning_detergent`)

Conditional on the named neutral aqueous cleaner actually used; record purchased formulation mass, complete supplier composition, dilution and route. Add a separate atomic row for each additional cleaning product used. Textile soaping formulations are not assumed compatible.

The broad hard-surface cleaning-agent identity conditionally locates this one complete neutral aqueous delivered formulation. Confirm actual cleaning purpose, full grade/SDS composition, supplied concentration and measured pH, water fraction, dilution water, phase and compatible provider mass basis. It does not establish a laundry/soaping recipe, pure surfactant mass or supplier background.

##### Waste flows

###### Captured fluff-pulp dust (`captured_pulp_dust`)

###### Cleaning wastewater to external treatment (`cleaning_wastewater`)

Conditional: one actual aqueous converter-cleaning effluent stream to a sewer or external treatment provider, with volume, density, detergent/solids composition and receiver conditions. It is neither a freshwater withdrawal nor a direct environmental release. Do not reuse manganese-residue washing wastewater. No on-site treatment is implied.

The broad industrial liquid-waste identity locates only this independent whole wet aqueous stream delivered to the actual named external receiver. Weigh whole wet kg or convert actual volume with a measured representative density; record water, solids, cleaner and other contamination, collection stage and acceptance/treatment conditions. Keep H2O and contaminant subledgers without a second external waste/water exchange; no hazard class, generic disposal route, credit or freshwater release is inferred.

## 7. Allocation and Co-product Handling

| rule_id | Applies to | Rule | source_ids |
| --- | --- | --- | --- |
| `allocation_hierarchy` | `conversion` | First investigate subdivision or system expansion to avoid allocation; isolate the actual lot/line with direct meters where subdivision is possible. If expansion is justified, include the additional functions and report the expanded system as a whole. Only after documenting why these approaches are unavailable, partition unavoidable shared energy/services using a relevant measured physical relationship; if unavailable, justify an alternative relationship with actual economic records and sensitivity. No universal mass or price fraction applies. Review before choosing substitution; no automatic scrap credit. | ec-pef-allocation-2021 |
| `physical_vs_burden` | `conversion` | Keep unallocated physical mass/water/carbon ledgers and diagrams separate from attributed environmental-burden ledgers. Physical coproduct or waste outputs and internal transfers stay at measured quantities; never mechanically multiply their physical output by the diaper allocation fraction. Attribute only justified common burdens without changing conservation. | ec-pef-allocation-2021 |
| `waste_rework` | `conversion` | Rejects are not saleable coproducts by default. Document any real external coproduct function/receiver before allocating. Internal rework remains physical recovery, without displacement credit; external waste treatment stays connected to the actual stream and actual receiver. | ec-pef-allocation-2021 |

## 8. Foreground Data Collection, Calculation, and Quality Rules

### Data Collection Protocols

| protocol_id | process_id | flow_role | record_type | raw_fields | collection_method | unit | frequency | temporal_coverage | site_scope | aggregation_rule | quality_evidence |
| --- | --- | --- | --- | --- | --- | --- | --- | --- | --- | --- | --- |
| `cp_output` | `conversion` | diaper_output | Calibrated dispatch and QC records | lot; size; date; accepted batches; gross and packaging tare; removed samples; reject mass; net Q; actual moisture; QC test method/results | Weigh complete accepted net diapers with calibrated scales and independently verified packaging tare; never infer item mass from marketing size or age. Retain raw production, dispatch, QC, returns and opening/closing feed, WIP and finished-stock records for the complete matched site/SKU/state/route period, including failed and zero-output runs, rejects, rework, changeovers, starts/stops, cleaning and attributable idle operations with their actual burdens. Q is unique newly generated accepted complete net diaper production in this pool, excluding packaging, rejects and removed samples. Use calibrated accepted-production weighing, or reconcile dispatch plus closing minus opening accepted stock with actual transfers/returns; do not reapply a stock correction to production already measured. Count each new lot only at its first quality release, including its newly released closing finished stock exactly once. Opening finished goods, prior accepted production Qc and genuine customer-return rework/reacceptance never create current new Q; retain their original cohort and prior acceptance record. Internal rework before first release is not an extra output. Later storage, packing, dispatch or return services retain their actual burdens with the served cohort; do not divide them by unrelated current new Q without an evidenced attribution and matched denominator. Track opening/closing WIP and stocks with their embodied material and carried production burdens, transferring rather than duplicating or dropping them; opening product dispatched is not new production. Retain the raw positive Q and each raw period total A_i without division here; normalize_net_product is the sole normalization step. If Q<=0 or the pool/burden match is unestablished, preserve raw records and leave normalized exchanges unavailable. | kg | Each lot and dispatch | Complete representative operating period, including changeovers, starts and losses | Declared line and SKU | per 1 kg reference flow | Scale calibration; tare samples; lot QA and stock reconciliation |

Screen all actual attributable maintenance oils/greases, filters, wipes and replacement consumables from service/issue/return/stock records. Document exclusions or supported absence; add separate atomic inputs and external spent streams with actual chemistry/form/quantity/receiver before dataset use, never a generic per-machine default. Keep row-specific stage logs; supplied subassemblies and embedded ingredients cannot be counted again. Supplier reference basis must be separately verified. A_i=sum disjoint external consumption totals for the matching lots; record incorporation, losses and stock change separately Retain each A_i as its raw matched-period total in the stated numerator unit, without prior division by Q; normalize_net_product performs the only normalization using cp_output Q.| kg | Each receipt/lot/shift | Same period/lots as Q | Declared product grades and line | per 1 kg reference flow | Supplier specifications; calibrated scale/roll meter; BOM/disassembly and stock balance |

Collect electric heating and compressed-air/HVAC energy, including idle/start-up attributable to the lot; avoid meter overlaps. A_e=3.6 times the justified attributed delivered kWh; stage and auxiliary totals reconcile to the same purchase meter Retain each A_i as its raw matched-period total in the stated numerator unit, without prior division by Q; normalize_net_product performs the only normalization using cp_output Q.| kWh; MJ | Interval meter and each campaign | Same complete period as Q | Factory delivery and declared stages | per 1 kg reference flow | Meter calibration, invoice, supply contract, driver justification |

Keep sewer handoff distinct from a direct discharge; complete any actual evaporation/discharge row before dataset use. Aggregate each stream separately; use actual density for m3-to-kg; retain whole physical water balance without conflating wastewater and tap input Retain each A_i as its raw matched-period total in the stated numerator unit, without prior division by Q; normalize_net_product performs the only normalization using cp_output Q.| kg; m3 | Each cleaning event and discharge | Matching lots and relevant auxiliary period | Declared line cleaning/auxiliaries | per 1 kg reference flow | Meters; lab density/analysis; cleaning logs; receiving conditions |

A_j=sum concentration_j times matching exhaust volume times 10^-6 plus independently measured fugitive kg; size bins mutually exclusive; no PM10 total added to its sub-bins Retain each A_i as its raw matched-period total in the stated numerator unit, without prior division by Q; normalize_net_product performs the only normalization using cp_output Q.| mg/m3; m3; kg | Validated sampling campaign with operational logs | Matched operating conditions and period Q | Outdoor air across converter boundary | per 1 kg reference flow | Lab methods/calibration; particle cut definitions; vent map; coverage and detection bounds |

### Calculation Rules

| rule_id | Applies to | Formula or rule | Inputs | Output | source_ids |
| --- | --- | --- | --- | --- | --- |
| `normalize_net_product` | Every external inventory row | For Q>0 with the complete matched pool and carried burdens established by cp_output, calculate q_i=A_i/Q exactly once from each raw external row total in its native numerator unit. Collection protocols retain raw totals; identical card expressions are references to this calculation. Convert native units before this step and do not divide an already normalized value again. Preserve complete physical exchange quantities and stock transfers separately from justified attributed environmental burdens. If Q<=0 or matching is unresolved, retain raw records and leave q_i unavailable. | A_i actual row total; Q measured complete net accepted kg; cp_output plus linked row protocol | Row unit per 1 kg net accepted diapers | pampers-manufacturing-traceability |
| `pulp_reference_conversion` | `fluff_pulp` | m_dry=m_received*s; m_provider=m_dry/s_provider | Measured received mass and solids s; separately declared supplier reference solids s_provider>0 | Provider-reference kg consistent with linked inventory. Use 0.90 only if that provider explicitly uses BREF AD convention; never default received s. | jrc-pulp-paper-bref-2015 |
| `electricity_conversion` | `grid_electricity` | A_e=3.6*E_kWh; retain the raw campaign MJ total for normalize_net_product only | cp_energy; cp_output | Raw campaign MJ; normalized MJ/kg only in normalize_net_product | pampers-manufacturing-traceability |
| `mass_water_carbon_ledgers` | `conversion` | At the production acceptance boundary, inputs + opening raw-material/WIP stock = newly accepted net diapers Q + separately identified other product/material transfers out + accompanying packaging + wastes/emissions + unused-material returns + closing raw-material/WIP stock; include any actual transfers into production and match their quantities at both ends. Do not add finished stocks of those same accepted diapers to this production ledger. Where actual finished storage/dispatch is included, keep a linked finished-stock ledger: opening finished stock + newly accepted production transferred in + other actual returns/transfers in = actual dispatch + other actual withdrawals/transfers out + closing finished stock. Returned/reaccepted lot transfers do not create new Q. On consolidation cancel the acceptance/rework handoffs and use actual external product dispatch with closing finished stock, never Q as an extra physical output as well. Retain all actual included handling, packing, storage and dispatch operations and their complete burdens, assigned to the matched lot/cohort; this clarification changes neither Q nor operation coverage. balance each material on measured dry/wet basis, water and carbon separately. Internal transfer quantities cancel. Preserve measured residual and uncertainty, not a forced yield. Each ledger uses receipts and actual handoffs at its own stated boundary consistently, not stock-adjusted consumption plus the same stock movements twice. Keep measured material-specific water/carbon fractions and origins for every actual component, formulation, auxiliary and packaging; unknown fractions/origins remain unknown. Water includes material/formulation moisture, retained product, shipped packaging, separate whole-wet waste and stocks; any measured net vapour subtracts matching incoming-air humidity before a reviewed outdoor-water elementary row is used. Constituent H2O/contaminants are subledgers, not duplicate external wastewater exchanges. Packaging receipts+opening reconcile independently to measured shipped tare, external scraps/returns and closing stocks, all outside Q. | cp_material; cp_output; cp_waste; cp_cleaning; cp_air | Unallocated physical ledgers, with fibre/polymer carbon retained in product and origin identified | ea-nappies-2008 |
| `exclusive_particle_bins` | pm_fine; pm_coarse; pm_large | If cumulative PM10 and PM2.5 are available on identical sampling bases, PM2.5–10=PM10-PM2.5; if total dust on that same basis is available, >PM10=total dust-PM10. Reject negative or mismatched-basis differences. Otherwise measure each size interval; do not infer missing bins or add cumulative totals to fractions. | cp_air | kg/kg; outdoor-air unspecified | jrc-pulp-paper-bref-2015 |
| `shared_burden` | Unavoidable shared utilities | B_lot=B_common*d_lot/sum(d_k), only for an evidenced relevant driver d; add directly metered lot burdens separately. Keep the physical quantities unchanged in the source ledgers. | cp_energy; measured driver and other coproduct records | attributed burden | ec-pef-allocation-2021 |
| `cohort_attribution` | Every external inventory row and stock transfer | Retain unallocated physical totals V_i separately from attributed totals A_i and the complete original provider vector, including upstream materials, utilities, freight and treatment. Carry ownership/cohort, physical quantity and that whole inherited vector through opening/WIP/finished stocks and every transfer; add only actual new services once. Direct burdens stay direct; shared burdens follow allocation_hierarchy and shared_burden. Normalize matched raw totals only through normalize_net_product, once. Failed, idle, cleanup and zero-Q records remain visible; unmatched services or Q<=0 leave normalized results unavailable. | cp_output; cp_material; cp_energy; cp_waste; cp_cleaning; cp_air; original provider vectors | Separate physical and attributed cohort ledgers | ec-pef-allocation-2021 |
| `packaging_cohorts` | pack_bag; pack_carton; packaging transfers and wastes | For each actual component/owner/cohort keep opening + P + N_ext + ER + internal_in = closing + EO + waste + internal_out. P is every purchased receipt, including packaging in an entire delivered price; N_ext is only first non-purchased external entry, not an internal reuse or genuine return. ER requires a documented earlier outward handoff of the same component; EO is gross actual external handoff, including packaging accompanying diapers. Record actual contents, tare, stocks, losses and ownership transfers. On consolidation cancel paired internal transfers only. Preserve original owner/cohort and full inherited provider vector for returns, reuse and transfers; non-purchased, free or uninvoiced items do not imply zero burden. Link an entire delivered provider or its disjoint component providers once, never both; no second production charge for the same return. Reconcile consumption for pack_bag/pack_carton to these events; this event ledger does not turn stock receipts into extra inventory purchases. Keep gross dispatch, freight and waste/treatment quantities separately; never net them against returns. Attribute actual new services to the served cohort before the single normalization, retaining earlier obligations as unavailable if evidence is missing. All packaging remains outside Q. | cp_material; cp_output; cp_waste; component handoff history and provider vectors | Component physical and burden reconciliation | ea-nappies-2008; ec-pef-allocation-2021 |

### Data Quality Requirements

| requirement_id | Applies to | Requirement | Evidence |
| --- | --- | --- | --- |
| `dq_identity` | All rows and reference | Actual physical chemistry/form/route, Chinese official UUID display, reference property/unit and supplier reference basis separately verified. Blank identities or unresolved provider conversions block those dataset exchanges, not proof of zero. | Supplier specs; original identity fields; basis records |
| `dq_quantities` | All amounts | No recipe, single-diaper mass, absorption multiplier or default emissions. Retain calibration, uncertainty, stock movements, actual component mass and allocation rationale for matching lots. | cp_output; cp_material; cp_energy; cp_waste; cp_cleaning; cp_air |
| `dq_scope` | Full dataset | List all actual component, utility, loss and emission pathways, including embedded pigments/finishes, formulation solids and actual attributable maintenance consumables/spent streams. Actual phase, maintenance and water-path uncertainty requires evidence or reviewed atomic extensions before dataset completeness, not invented zero or guessed recipes. Extend atomic inventory before use when an actual missing material, fuel, steam, volatile species, water exit or waste appears. Missing periods/particle bins remain explicitly inconclusive. | Plant diagram; lot BOM/disassembly; monitoring and receiver map |

## 9. Validation Rules

| rule_id | Applies to | Rule | source_ids |
| --- | --- | --- | --- |
| `validate_reference` | `diaper_output` | Require exactly one complete product output tied to the reference, Q>0, net mass including all actual retained components, and matching 1 kg denominator in all rows/protocols/calculations and both languages. Reject packaging in Q, invented item masses, size mixing without lot separation and duplicate intermediate reference outputs. | pampers-swaddlers-construction |
| `validate_boundary_identity` | `conversion` | Validate route, BOM, supplied-component states, upstream pulp boundary and supplier property/basis compatibility. Unresolved SAP/formulation/fastener/waste UUIDs and unknown grade conversions remain dataset blockers until resolved or documented absent. Do not silently use a near-name chemical or unrelated wastewater. | jrc-pulp-paper-bref-2015; pampers-swaddlers-construction |
| `validate_conservation` | `conversion` | Require separate physical and burden ledgers, conserved internal links, packaging and reject stock reconciliation, and complete water/carbon balance with reported residuals/uncertainty. No automatic waste/coproduct credits or mechanical allocation of physical output. Check first-release Q, paired stage transfers, complete inherited provider vectors and packaging_cohorts/cohort_attribution; later services cannot silently enter an unrelated new-production denominator. | ec-pef-allocation-2021; ea-nappies-2008 |
| `validate_air_completeness` | pm_fine; pm_coarse; pm_large | Require correct outdoor-air medium, mutually exclusive particle intervals, actual exhaust/fugitive coverage and gas bases. Captured dust must not be counted as airborne emission. Missing monitoring is unknown, not zero; a total-only measurement cannot justify three resolved fractions. Additional real emissions require separately verified species/media. | jrc-pulp-paper-bref-2015 |
| `validate_claims` | Comparison and completeness | Do not compare a kilogram manufacturing unit with an excreta-containment service without separately evidenced count, tested function, usage and end-of-life scenarios. Report checks performed/skipped, errors, unknown coverage and unresolved provider identity separately from PCR maturity; an authored candidate is not independent scientific approval. | ea-nappies-2008 |
