# Uncoated UF-bonded wood particleboard with audited resin preparation

## 1. Scope and Applicability

This PCR covers flat, non-oriented, uncoated wood-particle panels consolidated by dry mat forming and hot pressing with unmodified UF binder. One dataset declares one wood-species/source blend, face/core particle specification, resin recipe, target density and thickness, release moisture and pressing route. Treat different formulations, density/thickness classes and continuous versus batch pressing as separate measured cohorts; no universal operating range or industry recipe is prescribed. [usda-handbook-2021; epa-pb-2002]

The UF preparation is an explicit foreground stage, either on the board site or at an identified supplier whose actual ingredient, energy, yield and emission records expand the foreground. Purchased aqueous formaldehyde supply begins upstream of the resin reactor; formaldehyde generation from methanol remains in its background supply dataset. A purchased adhesive identified only as a UF/MUF/PF/pMDI family is insufficient for this route. The actual resin recipe and every added chemical must be known; a supplier-specific verified formulation may support a later reviewed route, but is not silently substituted here. No supplier-average recipe is adopted. [wilson-resins-2010]

Exclude OSB/waferboard with oriented or distinct wafer architecture; bamboo, flax, bagasse or other non-wood furnish; MDF/hardboard based on fibers; veneer/laminated or paper-faced/painted panels; molded articles; preservative-treated recovered wood; MUF, PF, pMDI and other binders; unidentified wax emulsions. Declare untreated dedicated chips, sawmill co-products and recovered clean solid wood separately. CPC 3.0:31431 is scope context; this limited route is a narrower candidate, not complete classification coverage. [usda-handbook-2021; corrim-pb-2024]

## 4. Measurement and Unit Rules

| rule_id | Applies to | Required property | Required unit | Rule |
| --- | --- | --- | --- | --- |
| `reference_mass` | reference product | Mass | kg | Use accepted net panel mass at declared release moisture, excluding packaging; collect Q using cp_reference. Every inventory denominator is per 1 kg reference flow. |
| `moisture_basis` | wood and panel physical ledgers | Mass | kg | Dry-basis u = water mass / oven-dry mass; wet mass = dry mass × (1+u). Wet-basis w = u/(1+u). Use same-sample oven-dry or validated meter records, and separate wood water from resin reaction/dilution water. [usda-handbook-2021] Keep the operational oven-test result and method distinct from true water content: validate the method for the wood/UF panel matrix, disclose and correct evidenced non-water volatile or continuing-cure loss, and retain unresolved interference. Water-specific or matrix-validated measurements are required for the H2O ledger; no guessed correction factor. Dry panel solids include retained cured UF/additives and are not pure dry wood. |
| `volume_conversion` | volume-based chips, gas and panel metadata | Volume and measured Mass | m3; kg | Panel volume = sum(actual length × width × thickness); panel density uses matching net mass and moisture. Wood-chip UUID 3fa2a6a7-224c-4d99-bd55-a214f0a83161 confirms material identity and Volume/m3 only, not bulk volume. Separate measured wet kg, loose bulk volume Vb, the fixed supplier/background reference amount A_provider with its unit and solid/bulk convention, and measured period demand volume V_provider expressed in that convention. Obtain the supplier/background solid-versus-bulk definition, moisture/state and packing convention; measure same-lot solid volume Vs, wet bulk density rho_b, solid density rho_s and packing k = Vs/Vb on compatible definitions. Obtain V_provider only through a validated matched-state conversion; provider-process scaling is n_provider = V_provider/A_provider and the native Volume exchange is V_provider/Q in m3/kg, each scaled/normalized once. A_provider remains the fixed provider reference amount, not measured demand or a per-kg quantity; database secondary mass/volume coefficients are not measured density or packing. Unknown A_provider/definition/conversion means an incomplete quantity link, even with a correct UUID. Gas volume likewise requires supplier/background reference conditions and matched state. [fao-ubet-volume; usda-handbook-2021] |
| `recipe_basis` | resin and additives | Mass | kg | Record each actual purchased ingredient/formulation; disclose product and active/solids kg separately. Do not count solution water or internal UF resin transfer twice. Never infer UF dosage from an industry-average percentage. [wilson-resins-2010] |
| `energy_basis` | energy and useful heat | Energy with declared physical basis | MJ | Electricity MJ = metered kWh × 3.6. Keep fuel LHV input and measured net delivered heat separate; no assumed boiler efficiency. Steam or hot-water useful heat requires supply and return flow/enthalpy, pressure, temperature and condensate/loss records plus matching background definition. A steam MJ property alone is insufficient. [epa-pb-2002; epa-boiler-2022] |

## 5. System Boundary

### Boundary Abstraction

| Field | Value |
| --- | --- |
| declared_starting_condition | Identified purchased wood feed at board mill and batch-assayed aqueous formaldehyde/urea at identified UF reactor; supply chains before these gates are linked backgrounds |
| starting_condition_role | Collected gate conditions, not burden-free origin |
| product_classification_scope | CPC 3.0:31431; narrower |
| recursive_input_rule | Same-category external board is not an allowed raw-wood shortcut; this route excludes resin-bonded recovered panel. Internal trim return is an internal ledger, not a new purchased reference flow |
| upstream_dataset_requirement | Source-specific wood forestry/chipping and co-product allocation; chemical manufacture; fuel and electricity supply; recovery operations; transport; waste treatment. No simultaneous purchased UF background when synthesis is expanded in foreground |
| disclosure | Board and resin sites, all gates and ownership, source species, prior material status, included heat/abatement, upstream stages, stock changes, excluded stages, allocation and uncertainty |

| rule_id | applies_to | rule | source_ids |
| --- | --- | --- | --- |
| `boundary_route` | all datasets | Only declared flat UF-bonded uncoated wood panels conform. Audit each ingredient and preparation stage; raw dedicated chips carry forestry and preparation; co-products carry justified source-stage burdens. Supplier resin expansion must retain its actual yield and transfer quantity. | `usda-handbook-2021`; `wilson-resins-2010`; `corrim-pb-2024` |
| `boundary_heat` | heat and emissions | Include actual dryer fuel/direct combustion, separate owned boiler, press heating, oxidizer fuel, wet controls and auxiliary electricity. One meter interval or emission stream is counted once. AP42 boiler evidence does not turn boiler emissions into dryer factors. Imported heat is outside the present enumerated fuel-owned route and needs separately verified supply and net heat basis. | `epa-pb-2002`; `epa-boiler-2022` |
| `boundary_recovery` | recovered wood | Require prior use/treatment, contamination testing, legal waste/product status, collection/sorting/cleaning/transport and loss records. Recycled is not evidence for zero burden; declare the recycling convention and sensitivity, and retain actual recovery burdens. | `corrim-pb-2024` |
| `boundary_downstream` | all datasets | Stop at accepted packaged board factory gate, with packaging exchanges separate from panel mass. Construction, use-phase formaldehyde exposure, service life, disposal and Module D credits require separate scenarios; no 75-year assumption or report end-of-life average is imported. | `corrim-pb-2024` |

## 6. Process Inventory Structure

### Process Map

| process_id | process_name | inclusion | inclusion_condition | role | quantitative_reference |
| --- | --- | --- | --- | --- | --- |
| `uf_board` | Audited UF preparation and wood particleboard manufacture | required | One declared recipe and panel cohort, source-resolved UF reactor and wood mill | aggregated_foreground | 1 kg accepted net panel |

Physical stages remain separately metered: wood receiving/sorting → refining/screening → drying → blending with batch-prepared UF → dry mat forming → hot pressing → cooling → sanding/trimming → stack/pack. UF reactor → blending is a measured wet-resin/solids transfer; dryer/boiler → press is a measured heat transfer. Supplier resin shipment, face/core splits, recovered wood yield, recycled trim and clean-fines-to-fuel links retain equal quantities at both ends. These are internal physical links within the aggregated unit; they do not create another finished-panel output. Exported sale/waste/emissions remain external inventory rows. [corrim-pb-2024, Table 9; epa-pb-2002, Figure 10.6.2-1]

## 7. Allocation and Co-product Handling

| rule_id | applies_to | rule | source_ids |
| --- | --- | --- | --- |
| `allocation_separation` | wood inputs and outputs | First subdivide or use measured causal drivers to separate dedicated wood, resin, heat and abatement burdens. Purchased sawmill co-products require documented supplier allocation; dry-mass allocation of joint source burdens is a declared baseline consistent with the cited study, not proof of zero price or zero burden. Retain a price/alternative-allocation sensitivity when economically different outputs make mass attribution uncertain. | `corrim-pb-2024` |
| `allocation_physical` | all physical exchanges | Preserve unallocated mass, water, carbon and internal heat/wood/resin transfers. Allocation shares apply to the separate environmental-burden account, not to physical co-product output, stock or internal-link quantity. Returned trim/fines are not independent sold products. Packaging and dedicated treatment remain attributable to the appropriate product. | `corrim-pb-2024` |
| `allocation_heat` | shared heat equipment | Use measured net useful heat delivered to each receiver to allocate shared boiler/resin heat burden; no fuel-only guessed efficiency or steam mass-only share. Disclose exports and losses. Exclude CHP from this route unless separately reviewed allocation and electricity exchanges are added. | `epa-boiler-2022`; `wilson-resins-2010` |

## 8. Foreground Data Collection, Calculation, and Quality Rules

| `cp_fuel` | uf_board | each external and internal fuel | measurement and traceable records | fuel id/species/origin; grade/blend; supplier; meter; wet mass; volume; density; moisture; carbon; LHV; absolute T/P; dry/wet convention; water content; gas composition; Z; meter Vm; background reference A and m3 definition; chip Vs/Vb/rho_b/rho_s/k and supplier definition; dryer/boiler/oxidizer/mobile equipment; stocks; internal clean-fines diversion | Meter/weigh separately by combustion equipment; supplier/background gas T/P, composition, dry/wet and Z definitions with actual reference A; site wood volume/mass/moisture/LHV assays and matching solid/bulk A definition. Keep physical measurements separate from resolved supply quantities; unknown A conversions remain unresolved. Reconcile external wood feed, internally diverted clean fuel and ash. Never use resin-bonded residues as clean untreated fuel. | kg; m3; MJ | each batch/lot and meter interval; period endpoints | complete declared accounting period including seasonal and start/stop variation | same product cohort; named resin supplier and board site; all shared recipients disclosed | per 1 kg reference flow | calibration; certificates; raw logs; reconciliation; uncertainty and gaps |
| `cp_heat` | uf_board | internal useful heat | measurement and traceable records | receiver; supply/return mass and enthalpy; temperature/pressure; condensate; steam quality; meter interval; losses; fuel input; resin/dryer/press demand; exported heat | Calibrated heat metering or supply-minus-return enthalpy balance with actual water/steam state; verify net delivered heat and match both link ends.

| `cp_pack` | uf_board | each packing component | measurement and traceable records | film polymer; strap grade/route; wood spacer species; delivered/used/returned mass; reuse turns; cohort; pack tare | Weigh individual components and reconcile purchases, stocks, returns/reuse; exclude packaging from Q. Include other actual packing components as separate rows before claiming complete inventory. | kg | each batch/lot and meter interval; period endpoints | complete declared accounting period including seasonal and start/stop variation | same product cohort; named resin supplier and board site; all shared recipients disclosed | per 1 kg reference flow | calibration; certificates; raw logs; reconciliation; uncertainty and gaps |

Exclude yard diesel already in own fuel account and avoid duplicate upstream transport. | t.km | each batch/lot and meter interval; period endpoints | complete declared accounting period including seasonal and start/stop variation | same product cohort; named resin supplier and board site; all shared recipients disclosed | per 1 kg reference flow | calibration; certificates; raw logs; reconciliation; uncertainty and gaps |

### Calculation Rules

| rule_id | Applies to | Formula or rule | Inputs | Output | source_ids |
| --- | --- | --- | --- | --- | --- |
| `calc_normalize` | all inventory rows | x_i = attributable inventory-adjusted exchange total / Q; Q is accepted net finished-panel kg from cp_reference. Reference output is 1 kg. Preserve absolute physical totals and attribution record separately. | cp_reference; all row collection protocols | normalized inventory | `corrim-pb-2024` |
| `calc_chip_supply_volume` | dedicated_chips; coproduct_chips; wood_fuel | At the same batch/state and matched solid/bulk definitions, k = Vs/Vb, m_wet = rho_b × Vb = rho_s × Vs. If the reference convention of A_provider is that same bulk basis, V_provider = Vb; if it is the compatible solid basis, V_provider = Vs = k × Vb. When reference moisture/state differs, first bridge conserved dry wood mass to the supplier reference moisture and measured corresponding density/packing; do not reuse source k or density across states. Declare fixed A_provider, unit, definition and evidence explicitly and retain converted period V_provider. Provider scaling is n_provider = V_provider/A_provider; normalize the native exchange V_provider/Q once without changing A_provider. Unknown A_provider/k/state leaves linkage incomplete; no FAO typical factor or database secondary property coefficient is a measured conversion. | cp_feed; cp_fuel; fixed supplier/background A_provider and definition; matched measurements; Q | fixed provider reference, raw/matched period volumes, process scaling and native per-kg exchange separately | `fao-ubet-volume`; `usda-handbook-2021` |
| `calc_gas_supply_volume` | natural_gas | For conserved gas amount with identical dry composition, V_provider = Vm × (Pm/Pb) × (Tb/Tm) × (Zb/Zm), using absolute temperatures/pressures and background reference b. The wet meter volume Vm requires measured water-vapour fraction and a validated dry/wet correction before this expression; differing composition or unsupported Z/reference conditions requires further supplier verification, not an assumed ideal-gas conversion. Keep actual Vm, converted period V_provider and fixed A_provider separately; n_provider = V_provider/A_provider and the native exchange V_provider/Q is normalized once. | cp_fuel; fixed supplier/background A_provider and T/P/composition/wet-dry/Z; Q | matched period V_provider, fixed A_provider, process scaling and native m3/kg separately | `epa-pb-2002` |
| `calc_wood_water` | wood and panel ledgers | m_dry = m_wet/(1+u); u = (m_wet-m_dry)/m_dry; w = u/(1+u). Reconcile dry wood, retained resin/additives, water carried in/added/generated, finished panel, external waste/emissions and stock changes; internal returns cancel only in aggregate and retain matched stage transfers. Keep the operational oven-test result and method distinct from true water content: validate the method for the wood/UF panel matrix, disclose and correct evidenced non-water volatile or continuing-cure loss, and retain unresolved interference. Water-specific or matrix-validated measurements are required for the H2O ledger; no guessed correction factor. Dry panel solids include retained cured UF/additives and are not pure dry wood. | cp_reference; cp_feed; cp_recipe; cp_water; cp_residue; cp_air | dry wood and water balances | `usda-handbook-2021` |
| `calc_recipe` | UF recipe and retained resin | Ingredient/formulation constituent mass = actual dosed product kg × batch-assayed mass fraction. Attribute supplier batch inputs/losses by actual resin quantity transferred to the board cohort; retain reaction yield, condensation water and loss balance. Do not add internal liquid UF resin as a second external input, and do not equate urea plus formaldehyde input mass with cured dry polymer mass. | cp_recipe; cp_water; cp_air; cp_residue | component and retained-solids ledger | `wilson-resins-2010` |
| `calc_heat` | heat receivers and fuel | Electricity MJ = kWh × 3.6. Fuel energy = measured fuel quantity on declared basis × matching measured LHV. Useful heat = supplied mass × supplied enthalpy minus returned mass × return enthalpy, corrected for documented losses/condensate. Reconcile receiver totals; unknown enthalpy/reference conditions prohibit a usable heat quantity. | cp_energy; cp_fuel; cp_heat | input energy and net useful heat separately | `epa-boiler-2022` |
| `calc_air` | species emissions | Integrate same-basis measured species concentration × dry volumetric gas flow rate over actual operating time, with concentration converted to kg/m3 and flow/time in compatible units; alternatively sum interval flow-weighted concentration × measured interval gas volume without another time factor; add separately measured fugitive sources once. Use consistent moisture/oxygen/temperature corrections and uncertainty. Do not infer site kg from a product chamber-test concentration, LCIA CO2-equivalent or VOC-as-carbon total. | cp_air | single-species net outdoor-air mass | `epa-pb-2002` |
| `calc_pm` | pm25; pmcoarse; pmover10 | On one common source, period and filterable/condensable definition: PM2.5 fraction = cumulative PM2.5; PM2.5–PM10 fraction = cumulative PM10 minus cumulative PM2.5; >PM10 fraction = total PM minus cumulative PM10. Require nonnegative results and measured compatible totals. Condensable PM must be assigned with documented size evidence or remain a separate unresolved exchange; no zero or guessed PM split. | cp_air | three non-overlapping fractions | `epa-pb-2002`; `epa-boiler-2022` |
| `calc_carbon` | wood/fuel/resin physical balances | Use measured dry material carbon and fossil/biogenic provenance. Reconcile carbon in panel, sold material, residues/ash, stocks, CO2, CO, methane and each measured organic species. Derive CO2 only from a validated residual carbon balance with 44/12, separately by origin; retain biogenic CO2 in LCI and disclose stored biogenic carbon separately from LCIA. No automatic negative CO2 at the factory for wood growth already in upstream datasets. | cp_feed; cp_recipe; cp_fuel; cp_residue; cp_air; cp_reference | separate fossil/biogenic carbon balances | `corrim-pb-2024`; `epa-boiler-2022` |
| `calc_allocation` | environmental burden ledger only | For eligible joint source outputs a_j = dry output mass j / total eligible dry output mass; B_j = a_j × joint burden + dedicated burden j. Use period-matched sale values for economic sensitivity and measured useful-heat shares for shared heat. Physical output and internal links retain full measured quantities. | cp_feed; cp_residue; cp_heat; actual joint burdens and prices | allocated environmental burden account | `corrim-pb-2024` |

### Data Quality Requirements

| requirement_id | Applies to | Requirement | Evidence |
| --- | --- | --- | --- |
| `quality_cohort` | all rows | Same recipe/specification/period Q; retain source and supplier scope, sampling representativeness and opening/closing stocks. No factory records have been obtained by this methodology itself. | cp_reference; cp_feed; cp_recipe |
| `quality_complete` | all flows | Assess every actual chemical, fuel, packing component, waste and species. Unmeasured, unavailable, below-detection and physically absent are distinct states. Extra actual ingredients or fuel routes require additional atomic rows and verified identities before dataset completeness; no aggregate adhesive family or VOC-total row. | cp_recipe; cp_fuel; cp_pack; cp_air |
| `quality_evidence` | numeric parameters | Use primary site/supplier measurements or independently justified exact-route factors with source location, units, control/device/species/fuel applicability and uncertainty. CORRIM 2021/2022 board and Wilson 2005 resin averages are not generic site quantities; no numerical range is prescribed here. | original records and source applicability |
| `quality_identity` | all UUIDs and gaps | Flow UUID is identity only; verify type, media, formulation, delivery state/route, reference property and unit against actual exchange. Verified Volume/m3 does not establish the actual supplier/background reference quantity A; solid/bulk chip definitions, same-lot packing/moisture and gas T/P/composition/wet-dry/Z must support the linkage. Blank UUID is unresolved, not proof of zero or database absence. No correction flow or unrelated stereoisomer/species is a substitute. | identity and support evidence |

Each protocol prepares unique attributable, inventory-adjusted period totals before aggregation; divide each exchange total by the same Q kg accepted net panel from cp_reference. A supplier resin batch is first attributed by the measured quantity transferred to the board cohort. Retain both absolute quantities and the resulting per 1 kg reference-flow values. No per-machine collection basis is used.

## 9. Validation Rules

| rule_id | applies_to | rule | source_ids |
| --- | --- | --- | --- |
| `validate_scope` | reference product | Declare all qualifiers and one same-cohort reference output. Uncoated wood particleboard identity cannot be established by CPC label alone; supplier recipe expansion and finished state must agree. | `usda-handbook-2021` |
| `validate_balance` | all physical exchanges | Use Q excluding packaging/rejects. Reconcile physical mass/water/carbon, actual wood losses, UF reaction/transfer yield and full internal-link equality; keep environmental allocation separate. Missing measurements or negative PM residuals remain unresolved. | `corrim-pb-2024`; `wilson-resins-2010` |
| `validate_emissions` | air and heat | Identify species, outdoor-air subcompartment, origin and units; no nested PM addition, total VOC proxy, guessed NOx split or suppressed biogenic CO2. Owned boiler and dryer boundaries remain separate in raw logs. Steam MJ without verified net supply/return basis is unresolved. | `epa-pb-2002`; `epa-boiler-2022` |
| `validate_release` | data package | Before a usable dataset claim, resolve all applicable UUID/unit, supplier/background reference-quantity A and chip/gas conversion, recipe, heat and emissions gaps, justify absent rows, add missing atomic exchanges and provide original records plus allocation sensitivity. Candidate methodology and software checks are not independent scientific approval. | `corrim-pb-2024` |
