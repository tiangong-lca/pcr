# Dry-process wood medium-density fibreboard manufacture

## 1. Scope and Applicability

Applies to conventional uncoated MDF made by dry forming wood fibres with the actual adhesive system, hot curing, cooling, sanding and trimming. Furnish may be traceable softwood or hardwood residues or whole logs. Dry process describes the forming route and medium; it does not mean steam-free or water-free production. Wet-process hardboard uses aqueous forming and dewatering, sometimes relying on lignin self-bonding, and requires a different methodology. Excluded are other high-density hardboards, wet low-density fibreboards, particleboard, OSB, nonwood fibreboards, veneered/coated boards and recipes requiring dedicated fire-retardant or preservative chemicals. Sources: `corrim-mdf-2024`; `epa-mdf-2002`; `usda-wood-handbook-2021`.

Wood provenance, species mix, density, thickness, moisture, declared formaldehyde class, binder composition and market requirements need dataset-specific evidence. No universal recipe, density cutoff, statutory formaldehyde limit or service life is prescribed. Product certification does not replace manufacturing stack-emission data.

## 4. Measurement and Unit Rules

| rule_id | Applies to | Required property | Required unit | Rule |
| --- | --- | --- | --- | --- |
| `reference_mass` | reference product | Mass `93a60a56-a3c8-11da-a746-0800200b9a66` | kg | Use cp_output to weigh accepted net MDF at the same declared state, excluding packaging. All rows are per 1 kg reference flow; wet furnish, dry wood mass and unsanded rough panels are not the denominator. |
| `moisture_basis` | furnish_chips, furnish_sawdust, furnish_shavings, mdf_output | Mass | kg | Use cp_furnish and cp_output to retain wet mass, oven-dry solids and water separately; dry-basis moisture u is water/dry mass and wet-basis moisture w is water/wet mass, both as fractions. These are same-state composition measurements, not invariant stage quantities; distinguish water-specific tests from volatile loss or test-induced curing and retain uncertainty. |
| `volume_basis` | furnish_chips, dryer_gas, control_gas, boiler_gas | Volume | m3 | Volume/m3 identity defines neither solid/bulk wood volume nor gas state. cp_furnish obtains supplier actual reference A, volume definition, same-lot/moisture Vs/Vb and measured k with loss/gate conversion. cp_energy and cp_energy_utilities obtain gas T/P, dry-wet composition, Z and background-m3 reference conditions. Any unproven correspondence remains quantity compatibility pending. |
| `electricity_conversion` | line_electricity, boiler_electricity | Energy | MJ | Convert metered kWh to MJ by multiplying by 3.6. The electricity dataset net-calorific-value property represents electric energy bookkeeping and proves no steam/process-heat net-heat basis. |
| `thermal_basis` | line_steam, line_heat, boiler_steam, boiler_heat, condensate_return, boiler_condensate | Steam mass; delivered heat | kg; MJ | cp_thermal and cp_thermal_utilities retain steam mass, condensation/return mass, temperature/pressure/quality and enthalpy boundary. Populate heat MJ only when supplier/background definition agrees with site supply-return enthalpy balance; property or product name alone is insufficient and unknown basis remains unresolved. |
| `reaction_accounting` | mdf-line; utilities | Mass | kg | Conserve whole mass and each actual element, including C/H/O/N/S and relevant inorganic elements, across each measured stage and the utility boundary, with combustion air and stocks included. Molecular H2O and wood/resin materials are reactive species, not separately conserved solids. Their ledgers require evidenced formation and consumption at actual reaction extents under cp_recipe, cp_fuel, cp_energy, cp_energy_utilities, cp_air, cp_air_utilities, cp_water, cp_water_utilities, cp_vapour and cp_vapour_utilities; unknown terms remain uncertain, not zero. UF/MUF condensation may form H2O; pMDI-water cure consumes H2O and forms CO2; fuels and controls can form H2O. Infer neither complete cure/combustion nor a universal yield. Sources: `usda-wood-joining-2023`; `doe-condensing-economizer-2012`; `epa-wood-boiler-2022`. |
| `nox_mass_basis` | dryer_nox, handling_nox, boiler_nox | Mass | kg | NOx kg requires a demonstrated common monitoring/LCI/LCIA-mapping mass basis and NO/NO2 boundary, excluding N2O and speciated duplicates; otherwise quantity compatibility pending. |

## 5. System Boundary

### Boundary Abstraction

| Field | Value |
| --- | --- |
| declared_starting_condition | Furnish/chemicals/energy delivered to mill; on-site line to accepted uncoated MDF at mill gate; link upstream production/inbound transport and actual waste treatment separately |
| starting_condition_role | foreground production |
| product_classification_scope | Conventional dry-process uncoated wood subset of CPC 3.0 31441 |
| recursive_input_rule | Record recycled MDF state, resin composition, provenance and actual mass without adding another finished output. Internal recirculation retains equal physical links; purchased recovered board carries supplier upstream boundary |
| upstream_dataset_requirement | Bind each actual furnish, resin, energy, transport and treatment to location/year/route-compatible background data; residues are not assumed burden-free |
| disclosure | Declare survey period, plant and output, stage coverage, on-site/purchased energy, controls, stock changes, exclusions, assumptions and actual use/disposal |

| rule_id | applies_to | rule | source_ids |
| --- | --- | --- | --- |
| boundary_stages | mdf-line | Include receipt, size preparation, digestion/refining, actual resin dosing, drying, forming/prepress, hot pressing, cooling, sanding/trimming and packaging; measure each stage even within one aggregated process. | `corrim-mdf-2024`; `epa-mdf-2002`; `usda-wood-handbook-2021` |
| boundary_energy | mdf-line; utilities | Choose on-site utility generation or purchased carrier for each supply share. Link equal carrier quantities at both internal ends and cancel internal transfers when aggregating; do not add purchased heat burdens to the same on-site fuels. Direct dryer/oxidizer/mobile combustion and boiler stacks remain distinct. | `corrim-mdf-2024`; `epa-mdf-2002`; `epa-wood-boiler-2022` |
| boundary_upstream | all inventory rows | Include actual upstream manufacture and inbound transport and disclose residue allocation/recovery boundary. End at the uncoated mill gate; downstream use, service life and disposal are separate scenarios, never copied from CORRIM cradle-to-grave averages. | `corrim-mdf-2024` |
| boundary_coverage | all inventory rows | Conditional rows are included only with actual activity/composition evidence. Missing UUID or amount is not zero and blocks complete use of the affected route. Expand every additional actual chemical, fuel, packaging or treatment exchange as its own atomic row; never conceal it in a collection label. | `corrim-mdf-2024`; `epa-mdf-2002`; `usda-wood-handbook-2021` |

## 6. Process Inventory Structure

### Process Map

| process_id | process_name | inclusion | inclusion_condition | role | quantitative_reference |
| --- | --- | --- | --- | --- | --- |
| `mdf-line` | Aggregated MDF manufacturing line | required | In-scope production | foreground production | 1 kg accepted net MDF |
| `utilities` | On-site utilities | conditional | On-site boiler supplies MDF steam/heat; purchased shares exclude the same generation burdens | utility generation | per 1 kg reference flow |

The manufacturing stage ledger stays within one foreground line; the boiler ledger belongs to the separately declared utilities process. Neither creates repeated finished-product trading. Retain unallocated whole-mass/elemental conservation and reaction-aware species ledgers separately from allocated environmental burdens; internal transfers and recirculation retain equal quantities at both ends. Apply reaction_accounting and physical_reconciliation, rather than forcing water or wood/resin solids to close without chemical terms. Sources: `corrim-mdf-2024`; `epa-mdf-2002`; `usda-wood-joining-2023`; `doe-condensing-economizer-2012`.

| stage_id | entering state | leaving state | separate collection |
| --- | --- | --- | --- |
| receipt | Wet chips, sawdust, dry shavings or logs; separate species/moisture/bark states | Screened/chipped furnish; bark separately routed | Lot net mass, volume, moisture, stocks |
| refining | Steam-softened wet furnish | Unresinated wet fibres/bundles; if resin is added in refiner record actual point | Electricity, steam mass, condensation, fibre solids/water |
| blend-dry | Wet fibres; resin status follows actual dosing route | Measured dried-fibre state; source-dependent post-control H2O and other gases | Each formulation/carrier water, fuel/moisture, inlet-air humidity, actual cure/reaction extent if occurring here, fibre water/solids, stack H2O, control condensation and stocks |
| form-press | Loose resinated fibres; uncured formed mat | Hot cured rough panel; actual pressing/cooling exhaust and recovered condensate | Actual recipe, cure time/temperature and measured reaction extent, mat/rough-panel mass/moisture/elemental composition, heat, recirculation, post-control H2O and other species, condensate and stocks |
| finish-pack | Cooled cured rough panel | Sanded/trimmed accepted MDF; resin-bearing dust/offcuts; separate packaging | Accepted net mass, thickness/density/moisture, captured dust/uncollected PM, packaging |
| boiler | Actual gas/wood/resin-bearing fuels, fuel moisture, combustion air/humidity, utility make-up and returned condensate | Delivered steam/heat, wet flue gas including boiler H2O vapour, collected residues and actual condensate/blowdown | Keep steam/condensate circuit distinct from reacting fuels/air/flue gas; measure each quantity, composition, control-water input, condensation, source-dependent H2O formation/consumption and stocks |

Recovered fibres, mat trim and cured sanding dust are different material states. Record each origin/destination, dry solids, water and resin separately for rerefining, reforming, combustion or disposal. Refining creates fibres; OSB strands and particleboard particles are not fibre intermediates.

#### Inputs

##### Product flows

###### Purchased wood chips (`furnish_chips`)

Record untreated chips delivered for fibre preparation; measure volume, wet mass, species and moisture for the same lot. Identity is retained but quantity compatibility is pending. Obtain the supplier/background process actual reference quantity A (m3), its solid-wood or loose/compacted bulk-volume definition and measurement gate. Measure solid volume Vs and bulk volume Vb on the same representative lot and moisture/material state, with packing fraction k = Vs/Vb and a documented sampling/displacement/geometric method. Reconcile delivery gates, stock changes and measured losses; neither the flow name nor Volume/m3 defines the required volume basis. If A, volume definition, k or state/gate conversion is unknown, the upstream link remains incomplete.

###### fibre drying air release: Nitrogen oxides (`dryer_nox`)

Collect this species after control at the stated source; record stack or fugitive capture coverage and carbon origin where specified. Applicable combustion species require actual firing/mobile activity; an untested or below-detection result is not zero. This is one real ILCD NOx aggregate parameter; Mass/kg does not define its reporting mass. Quantity compatibility is pending until the monitoring report, LCI flow definition and selected LCIA mapping demonstrate the same basis: NO2-equivalent mass or actual summed NO and NO2 mass, with explicit species coverage. Exclude N2O from NOx. Do not populate by assuming NOx equals NO2 mass, invent a NO/NO2 ratio, or also add separately modelled NO/NO2 for the same release. If the common basis cannot be demonstrated, retain the pending quantity; a future speciation route requires independently verified NO and NO2 identities and actual speciation evidence.

Applicable combustion species require actual firing/mobile activity; an untested or below-detection result is not zero. This is one real ILCD NOx aggregate parameter; Mass/kg does not define its reporting mass. Quantity compatibility is pending until the monitoring report, LCI flow definition and selected LCIA mapping demonstrate the same basis: NO2-equivalent mass or actual summed NO and NO2 mass, with explicit species coverage. Exclude N2O from NOx. Do not populate by assuming NOx equals NO2 mass, invent a NO/NO2 ratio, or also add separately modelled NO/NO2 for the same release. If the common basis cannot be demonstrated, retain the pending quantity; a future speciation route requires independently verified NO and NO2 identities and actual speciation evidence.

##### Elementary flows

###### Boiler air release: water vapour (`boiler_water-vapour`)

Measure gaseous H2O released to outdoor air at the actual boiler post-control outlet, using cp_vapour_utilities; this is distinct from delivered utility steam, condensate returns and dryer/press releases. Retain measured wet flue-gas flow, H2O concentration, temperature/pressure, operating time, fuel/air composition and stocks. Support source separation of fuel moisture, ambient inlet-air humidity, recipe/resin-bearing fuel contributions, actual chemical H2O formation/consumption and control-water addition. Trace captured/condensed water at its actual liquid/recovery destination, not as emitted vapour. Actual reaction extent is required for chemical source attribution; infer neither complete combustion nor a boiler yield. Total measured stack H2O already includes reaction water: do not add that formation amount again. Shared-stack amounts are attributed once on supported source records; unknown terms remain uncertain, not zero.

###### Boiler air release: Nitrogen oxides (`boiler_nox`)

Collect the boiler stack species after control; bind fuel mix, operating mode and test method. Preserve biogenic CO2 in LCI and separate fossil carbon from resin or support gas. This is one real ILCD NOx aggregate parameter; Mass/kg does not define its reporting mass. Quantity compatibility is pending until the monitoring report, LCI flow definition and selected LCIA mapping demonstrate the same basis: NO2-equivalent mass or actual summed NO and NO2 mass, with explicit species coverage. Exclude N2O from NOx. Do not populate by assuming NOx equals NO2 mass, invent a NO/NO2 ratio, or also add separately modelled NO/NO2 for the same release. If the common basis cannot be demonstrated, retain the pending quantity; a future speciation route requires independently verified NO and NO2 identities and actual speciation evidence.

## 7. Allocation and Co-product Handling

| rule_id | applies_to | rule | source_ids |
| --- | --- | --- | --- |
| allocation_physical | all inventory rows | Retain unallocated physical stream quantities and whole-mass/elemental conservation and reaction-aware species ledgers; do not multiply actual MDF, residue or internal-link quantities by a burden-allocation fraction. Internal recovered dust is not a second saleable output. | `corrim-mdf-2024` |
| allocation_single_product | mdf-line | Where accepted MDF is the only valuable product, assign attributable line burdens to MDF and retain actual waste/energy recovery separately. Determine waste versus saleable coproduct from contracts and actual use, not from the word residue. | `corrim-mdf-2024` |
| allocation_shared | mdf-line; utilities | First separate causal stage/customer loads using submetering and source-specific activity. If irreducible shared coproduct burdens remain, document the chosen physical relationship and consistent moisture/energy basis; any economic alternative needs current transaction evidence, sensitivity and review. Do not assume that CORRIM upstream residue mass allocation or one-product A3 condition applies to every plant. | `corrim-mdf-2024` |

### Calculation Rules

| rule_id | Applies to | Formula or rule | Inputs | Output | source_ids |
| --- | --- | --- | --- | --- | --- |
| `normalize_output` | all inventory rows | Normalized exchange = attributable actual total exchange for that row in the period / accepted net MDF mass. Preserve numerator kg, m3 or MJ; denominator is cp_output kg; mdf_output is fixed at 1 kg per reference flow. | actual row amount; accepted net mass; cp_output | per 1 kg reference flow | `corrim-mdf-2024` |
| `moisture_conversion` | furnish_chips, furnish_sawdust, furnish_shavings, mdf_output | Dry mass = wet mass/(1+u); water = wet mass - dry mass; w=u/(1+u). u is dry-basis and w wet-basis fraction; resin and inorganic additives are not dry wood. Apply only to a measured composition at the same state; wet-minus-dry test loss is not automatically pure H2O where volatiles or cure interfere, and this formula is not reaction-stage conservation. | wet mass; dry-basis moisture; cp_furnish; cp_output | dry solids and water | `usda-wood-handbook-2021` |
| `recipe_split` | binder_uf, binder_muf, binder_pmdi, additive_wax, additive_hardener | Formulation solids = delivered formulation mass × measured solids fraction; carrier water uses its actual formulation fraction, not assumed all nonsolids. Apply this analytical split to each actual supply in its verified complete-product or independently supplied chemical reference basis; a whole prepared formulation cannot be assigned to a constituent UUID. These component ledgers do not create duplicate purchases. Preserve supplier manufacture/preparation/delivery once and separately record true onsite purchases, mixing water/utilities and losses. Incoming formulation split does not establish cured-solid conservation; use actual reaction extent under physical_reconciliation, excluding upstream synthesis. | delivered formulation; solids fraction; water fraction; cp_recipe | component ledger | `corrim-mdf-2024`; `usda-wood-joining-2023` |
| `volume_conversion` | furnish_chips, mdf_output, dryer_gas, control_gas, boiler_gas | Board volume = measured area × thickness. Measure chip k = Vs/Vb on the same lot/moisture/state: use Vs for a supplier/background solid-volume definition or Vb at matching compaction for bulk volume; reconcile gates using measured stocks/losses. Background-process multiplier = matching volume / its actual reference amount A; normalize the actual inventory exchange by accepted net MDF mass separately. Unknown A/definition leaves the link incomplete; unknown density/packing is no substitute. Gas quantity conversion requires measured meter T/P, dry-wet composition, Z and matching background-m3 state, with no assumed standard volume. | Vs; Vb; k; A; measured stocks/losses; gas T/P/composition/Z; cp_furnish; cp_energy; cp_output; cp_energy_utilities | consistent volume or mass | `usda-wood-handbook-2021`; `corrim-mdf-2024` |
| `thermal_reconciliation` | line_steam, line_heat, boiler_steam, boiler_heat, condensate_return, boiler_condensate | Indirect net delivered heat = sum(supply mass × supply specific enthalpy) - sum(return mass × return specific enthalpy), using common enthalpy datum and period. Supplier/background definition must match this boundary. For no-return/direct digestion disclose condensate fate and reference datum; fuel calorific value or property name is no substitute. Heat remains unresolved until demonstrated. | mass; supply/return states; enthalpy definition; cp_thermal; cp_thermal_utilities | carrier mass and verified delivered heat | `epa-mdf-2002`; `corrim-mdf-2024` |
| `emission_mass` | all elementary outputs | Emission mass = species concentration on consistent dry/wet, temperature/pressure and oxygen basis × matching gas flow × operating time, or applicability-verified factor × measured activity on the same basis. Do not count both upstream and final stack for a shared exhaust. | concentration; gas flow; operating time; activity; cp_air; cp_air_utilities; cp_vapour; cp_vapour_utilities | species emission mass | `epa-mdf-2002`; `epa-wood-boiler-2022` |
| `pm_partition` | all particulate outputs | Only for the same stack/test coverage with compatible cumulative sizes: PM2.5 row = cumulative PM2.5; PM2.5–10 row = cumulative PM10 - cumulative PM2.5; >PM10 row = total PM - cumulative PM10. Check nonnegativity; incompatible condensable/filterable definitions or missing sizes prevent partition and remain unresolved. | same-basis total PM; cumulative PM10; cumulative PM2.5; cp_air; cp_air_utilities | nonoverlapping particulate masses | `epa-mdf-2002`; `epa-wood-boiler-2022` |
| `physical_reconciliation` | mdf-line; utilities | For each stage and utilities, opening stock + inputs = closing stock + outputs for whole mass and each actual element, including C/H/O/N/S and relevant inorganic elements. Include measured combustion/ventilation air, oxygen/nitrogen, actual fuel/recipe composition, product, residues, all gas species, condensate and stocks. Molecular H2O and wood/resin material ledgers instead use opening + inputs + evidenced formation = closing + outputs + evidenced consumption. Derive chemical terms from actual formulation, cure/fuel conditions and measured reaction extents; UF/MUF water formation, pMDI-water consumption/CO2 formation and combustion/control transformations are not default yields. Keep delivered and cured solids distinct, exclude upstream synthesis, preserve equal internal links and biogenic versus fossil carbon origin. Unknown composition/extent remains uncertain; disclose residuals and measurement uncertainty without forced closure or assuming full cure/combustion. | stage flows; stocks; actual elemental/species composition; reaction extents; cp_furnish; cp_recipe; cp_water; cp_thermal; cp_air; cp_fuel; cp_energy; cp_vapour; cp_water_utilities; cp_thermal_utilities; cp_air_utilities; cp_energy_utilities; cp_vapour_utilities | whole-mass/elemental conservation and reaction-aware species ledgers | `corrim-mdf-2024`; `epa-wood-boiler-2022`; `usda-wood-joining-2023`; `doe-condensing-economizer-2012` |
| `vapour_source_reconciliation` | dryer_water-vapour, press_water-vapour, boiler_water-vapour | Obtain actual emitted gaseous H2O by emission_mass from simultaneous matched-state H2O concentration, wet-gas flow and operating time. Reconcile its sources using measured furnish/recipe water, fuel moisture, inlet-air humidity/quantity, steam/condensate, control water, stocks and evidenced source-specific formation/consumption at actual cure/combustion extents. Gross measured H2O contains chemical reaction water already; source decomposition is a ledger, not an extra emission. Any subtraction of pass-through ambient humidity requires measured inlet/outlet coverage and a declared convention, retaining gross total. Captured flue condensate follows its actual destination; utility-loop steam/return mass is separate. Shared stacks are counted once with supported attribution. Unknown source fractions or reaction extents remain uncertain, not assigned zero or balanced by invented yields. | wet-stack H2O/flow/time; source records and reaction extents; cp_vapour; cp_recipe; cp_water; cp_fuel; cp_air; cp_thermal; cp_output; cp_vapour_utilities; cp_water_utilities; cp_air_utilities; cp_thermal_utilities; cp_energy; cp_energy_utilities | actual emitted H2O and supported source ledger | `usda-wood-joining-2023`; `doe-condensing-economizer-2012`; `epa-stack-moisture-method4`; `epa-wood-boiler-2022` |
| `nox_compatibility` | dryer_nox, handling_nox, boiler_nox | Compare monitoring, LCI and selected LCIA-mapping NOx mass definitions and NO/NO2 coverage. Generate an aggregate quantity using cp_air only when all three share the same basis; infer neither NO2-equivalent mass nor NO/NO2 ratio, exclude N2O and avoid speciated duplicates. Otherwise quantity remains pending. | monitoring mass definition; flow mass definition; LCIA mapping; cp_air; cp_air_utilities | compatible NOx quantity or explicit pending result | `epa-mdf-2002`; `epa-wood-boiler-2022` |
| complete_period_normalization | all inventory rows | Every existing campaign, batch or lot amount rule and linked collection protocol uses one documented complete reporting-period pool for the same declared product, grade, route, configuration, site and reference state. Accepted-lot wording identifies the denominator only; retain all attributable startup, shutdown, wholly failed or zero-output batches, rejects, work in progress and rework in the raw native-unit numerator records. Count reworked reference product once only when finally accepted. Sum each attributable exchange over this matched pool, divide once by its strictly positive accepted reference-product quantity in the declared denominator unit, and scale to the declared reference quantity. Do not average batch ratios, drop a failed batch, pool unrelated products/periods or replace native numerator units. If the entire matched pool has no accepted output, retain the unnormalized absolute inventory and require review; issue no normalized result or fabricated output. Preserve stock/return and physical-transfer ledgers independently of burden allocation; allocation never removes already-incurred failed/rework activity. | all linked raw collection protocols; accepted reference-product pool; stock and rework links | native exchange unit per declared reference quantity; zero-output pool remains unnormalized |  |

### Data Quality Requirements

| requirement_id | Applies to | Requirement | Evidence |
| --- | --- | --- | --- |
| quality_primary | all inventory rows | Retain actual production, metering, stocks and representative operating modes for the same period; never generalize CORRIM regional recipes/energy or softwood sawmill surveys into category parameters. | collection originals and applicability review |
| quality_missing | all inventory rows | Distinguish unknown, unmeasured, BDL and true zero; ranges need independent compatible evidence. This candidate has no synthesized reviewed universal ranges. | missingness, detection limits, range-evidence gaps |
| quality_reactions | mdf-line; utilities | Retain reaction extent, actual composition, method/stock uncertainty and gross versus source-attributed H2O. Evaluate residuals with measurement uncertainty; do not force molecular water or wood/resin solids to conserve, use missing terms as zero, or replace measured outlet H2O with an assumed boiler/cure yield. | actual formulation/cure, fuel/air, wet-stack, steam/condensate and stock records |
| quality_claims | mdf_output | Density, thickness, moisture and formaldehyde class require test state/method/date and applicable version; report titles/classification labels establish no performance/regulatory conformity. | product tests and supplier declarations |

## 9. Validation Rules

| rule_id | applies_to | rule | source_ids |
| --- | --- | --- | --- |
| validation_reference | mdf_output | Require one final reference output, matched mass property/unit and every qualifier; same-period net accepted mass excludes packaging. Other stage states are physical-ledger entries within the line, not duplicate MDF outputs. | `corrim-mdf-2024`; `epa-mdf-2002`; `usda-wood-handbook-2021` |
| validation_quantity_compatibility | furnish_chips; dryer_gas; control_gas; boiler_gas; dryer_nox; handling_nox; boiler_nox | Confirmed UUID/property/unit does not establish quantity compatibility. Chips require supplier A, volume definition, matched-moisture/state Vs/Vb/k and loss/gate correspondence; gas requires T/P, dry-wet composition, Z and background-m3 correspondence; NOx requires common monitoring/LCI/LCIA mass definition, NO/NO2 coverage, N2O exclusion and no speciated duplicates. Any unknown remains quantity compatibility pending and the affected link/result incomplete. | `corrim-mdf-2024`; `epa-mdf-2002`; `epa-wood-boiler-2022` |
| validation_inventory | all inventory rows | Each actual exchange has one atomic identity, state, direction, type, property/unit, protocol and denominator. Resolve blank UUIDs and route/grade mismatches before complete use of the affected route; never select a nearby board or correction flow. | `corrim-mdf-2024`; `epa-mdf-2002`; `usda-wood-handbook-2021` |
| validation_balances | mdf-line; utilities | Verify whole-mass and actual-element C/H/O/N/S and relevant inorganic-element conservation separately from reactive H2O/wood/resin ledgers with supported formation/consumption and actual extents. Require actual formulation/cure, fuel/air, wet flue gas, steam/condensate, residues and stock records; unknown terms and unexplained residuals remain uncertain, not zero or forced closure. Preserve equal internal links, actual recirculation fates and unscaled physical outputs independently of burden allocation; assume neither full cure nor combustion. | `corrim-mdf-2024`; `usda-wood-joining-2023`; `doe-condensing-economizer-2012`; `epa-wood-boiler-2022` |
| validation_vapour | dryer_water-vapour; press_water-vapour; boiler_water-vapour | Require the distinct boiler H2O output whenever the included boiler operates; dryer/press rows do not cover it. Verify gaseous air identity and measured post-control wet-stack quantity/protocol with supported recipe/cure, fuel/moisture, ambient-humidity, steam/control-water and reaction source separation. Separate captured condensate and utility carriers/returns; verify no droplet bias or unproved state conversion. Count each final stack once; do not add formation water to an already measured H2O total. Unknown source attribution/extent stays uncertain and affected source reconciliation incomplete, even if gross H2O was measured. | `doe-condensing-economizer-2012`; `epa-stack-moisture-method4`; `usda-wood-joining-2023`; `epa-wood-boiler-2022` |
| validation_thermal | line_steam; line_heat; boiler_steam; boiler_heat | A steam/heat MJ property is insufficient evidence of net delivered heat. Require supplier/background definition, metering boundary and matched state/enthalpy balance; unknown basis is inconclusive. Do not double count utility fuels and purchased heat. | `epa-mdf-2002`; `corrim-mdf-2024` |
| validation_air | all elementary outputs | Verify species, outdoor-air medium, actual source and biogenic/fossil origin; retain biogenic CO2 in LCI regardless of impact-accounting conventions. Use compatible nonoverlapping PM bins and disclose detection limits/condensables. Manufacturing factors are not boiler factors; clean-wood factors require review for resin-bearing dust. | `epa-mdf-2002`; `epa-wood-boiler-2022` |
| validation_readiness | all inventory rows | Methodology is authored candidate guidance requiring independent scientific review. Passing structural/measurement checks establishes neither legal conformity nor a completed site LCI; unresolved identities, heat definitions and range evidence remain explicit. | `corrim-mdf-2024`; `epa-mdf-2002`; `usda-wood-handbook-2021` |
