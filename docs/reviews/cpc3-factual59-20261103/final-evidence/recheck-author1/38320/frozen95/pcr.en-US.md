# All-solid steel-string acoustic guitar manufacture

## 1. Scope and Applicability

This attributional method covers manufacture of complete new non-electronic six-string all-solid wood acoustic guitars: solid Adirondack spruce soundboard, solid Indian rosewood back/sides, mahogany neck, ebony fingerboard/bridge and bone nut/saddle, with actual integral bracing, linings, blocks, bindings, purfling, tuners, truss rod, individual strings, fittings, nitrocellulose body finish and polyurethane neck finish. The terminal is the unique first quality release of a complete usable instrument after actual stringing, setup, sound/playability and appearance acceptance. It starts with the actual supplied dried wood/whole boards or already prepared tonewood parts and real supplied accessories and preparations, not purchased finished guitars for repacking. Sources: `yamaha-fg9-r`; `yamaha-craftsmanship`; `yamaha-choose`.

Exclude keyboard-string instruments/pianos, bowed strings, nylon/classical guitars, electric/acoustic-electric pickups or preamps, amplifiers, synthesis/MIDI/toys, laminated/HPL/plywood bodies, carbon/plastic bodies, unfinished bodies/necks/soundboards, unstrung kits and stand-alone strings or other parts. These are different physical/function or manufacturing boundaries, not automatically covered by CPC 38320. The six-string construction is this narrow category, not a default for all string instruments. No certification, service lifetime, tone/strength threshold, tuning frequency/tension, species substitution, moisture target, thickness, recipe, cycle time, yield or energy factor is prescribed.

| covered_products | Complete first-released six-string non-electronic all-solid Adirondack-spruce/Indian-rosewood acoustic guitars of the declared mahogany/ebony/bone configuration |
| excluded_products | Pianos/keyboards; bowed/nylon/electric/electronic/toy/kit instruments; laminated/HPL/plastic bodies; stand-alone components |
| representative_product | A complete FG9 R-like physical construction, qualitatively synthesized from primary manufacture evidence; not a measured FG9 R inventory or one factory order |
| production_route | Actual dried tonewood supply -> remaining woodworking and structural assembly -> actual coating/polishing -> complete hardware/string assembly and setup -> unique first quality release |
| market_state | Complete usable new non-electronic acoustic guitar at first manufacturer quality release; net instrument mass excludes independent accessories and packaging; later actual gate services remain separate |

## 3. Reference Flow

| Field | Value |
| --- | --- |
| What | Provide a complete playable non-electronic steel-string acoustic instrument of the declared configuration |
| How much | 1 kg net complete instrument at unique first quality release; not 1 kg soundboard, timber, neck or strings |
| How well | Actual approved construction and measured first-release functional/sound/playability/appearance criteria declared; no invented pass threshold |
| How long or cycle | One unique first-release manufacturing cohort; actual later services disclose original Q_H and observed H; no lifetime claim |
| reference_flow_link | `finished_guitar` |

| Field | Value |
| --- | --- |
| Reference amount | 1 |
| Reference product flow | Other string musical instruments `9fa0d42e-18d3-4a28-8ffa-f382932ec5ad` |
| Reference flow property | Mass `93a60a56-a3c8-11da-a746-0800200b9a66` |
| Reference unit group | Units of mass `93a60a57-a4c8-11da-a746-0800200c9a66` |
| Reference unit | kg |
| Required qualifiers | six-string non-electronic configuration and unique instrument/lot identity; solid Adirondack spruce soundboard and solid Indian rosewood back/sides with actual species and origin; mahogany neck and ebony fingerboard/bridge with actual supplied machining state; actual complete bracing/lining/block/binding/purfling/bridge-pin/pickguard/fixing BOM; bone nut/saddle and real adjustment scope; each actual string position/gauge/material and mechanical tuner identity; actual neck joint and any separate bolts/inserts; actual adhesive system with joint/specification permission; actual nitrocellulose body and polyurethane neck coating system and supplied whole preparations; actual wood moisture/conditioning state and same-configuration measured net instrument mass; calibration and first-release functional/sound/playability/appearance acceptance record; actual factory geography period and unique first-release Q; raw/WIP stocks and each inherited flow vector; original FG cohort Q_H and observed service horizon H; gross G/R and original shipment plus actual postwork permission/tests/disposition; per-article six packaging legs and whole/component disjoint bridge; actual utilities/carrier thermal state/returns and supplier water-energy ownership; independent physical mass/element/carbon/water and species-specific emission constraints; independent supplied case/wrench/documents excluded from net guitar mass but accounted once |

All qualifiers are required metadata, description or equivalent package fields. The selected native family is a manufactured finished Product, production mix at plant, with Mass reference and no stated fixed geography/species/grade/life; positive primary whole-terminal evidence restricts it to this complete configuration. Preserve this context with the finished row and all normative ancestors. Count records do not set kg: actual net instrument mass and moisture are independently measured, never inferred from a secondary native coefficient or another guitar.

## 4. Measurement and Unit Rules

| rule_id | Applies to | Required property | Required unit | Rule |
| --- | --- | --- | --- | --- |
| reference_mass | reference product | Mass `93a60a56-a3c8-11da-a746-0800200b9a66` | kg | Use 1 kg complete net instrument reference. Collect actual net mass of each accepted same-configuration complete instrument using cp_release with calibration and actual moisture; no assumed per-item mass, density, board thickness or count-to-kg factor. |
| raw_native_units | all actual inventory rows | Actual native extensive property of that exchange | Actual native unit | Mass kg is not imposed on MJ, kWh, m3 or h. Unit/rate conversion precedes real attribution and the sole quotient. Preserve gas/liquid state, thermal enthalpy, measured density and original units. |
| once_only | all actual inventory rows | Actual row property | Actual row unit per reference flow | Raw collection stays undivided. The one section-8 cohort quotient produces x_i; cards/aggregation reuse that result. Gross cards use full actual V, not a burden vector, stock-corrected consumption or economic share. Q_c=0 retains actual numerators without a unit result. |

## 5. System Boundary

### Boundary Abstraction

| Field | Value |
| --- | --- |
| declared_starting_condition | Actual untreated dried solid tonewood or whole prepared solid panels/components, real accessories and whole preparations at declared supplier/foreground handover |
| starting_condition_role | Foreground receipt condition; supplied forestry/sawmilling/drying/joining/machining/metal/string/formulation manufacture stays upstream once |
| product_classification_scope | Narrow complete non-electronic six-string all-solid acoustic construction within CPC 38320; no whole-leaf collection |
| recursive_input_rule | A whole same-category finished guitar is not an ordinary raw input. Actual returned original-cohort instruments keep original history and separate service/rework; buying finished guitars for repacking cannot satisfy manufacture |
| upstream_dataset_requirement | One compatible actual provider per supplied whole article/preparation/service and included boundary. Preserve real supplier-included packaging and upstream owner, unresolved providers and inherited per-flow vectors; no automatic zero |
| disclosure | Actual supply face, route/joint/order, geography/time, BOM, moisture, net mass/release, raw/WIP/FG history, package/assets/service horizons and every identity/measurement/provider gap |

| rule_id | Applies to | Rule | source_ids |
| --- | --- | --- | --- |
| b_route | complete instrument route | Receive actual dried tonewood/complete supplied boards or machined parts at their declared supply face. Include remaining cutting/planing/edge joining, bracing and lining/block bonding, actual side bending, neck/fingerboard/fret and bridge work, coating/sanding/drying/polishing, approved neck joint, tuner/string fitting, setup and final function/playability/sound/appearance acceptance. Purchased completed work stays upstream once; supplied components and internal whole-guitar handoffs never become another external whole-guitar purchase or Q. | `yamaha-craftsmanship`; `yamaha-body`; `yamaha-final`; `yamaha-fg9-r` |
| b_source_limits | source-specific routes | This is transparent qualitative technical synthesis, not one measured factory/SKU BOM. FG9 R supplies a coherent all-solid non-electronic terminal; its bolt-on neck overrides generic dovetail/set-neck prose for that example. Generic simultaneous body gluing and L-Series sequential gluing are alternatives, not added operations. Do not impose A.R.E., electric I.R.A., classical nylon/shellac, laminated panels or electronics. Actual joint/coating system and work order require the real approved specification; no source example authorizes all joints. | `yamaha-fg9-r`; `yamaha-craftsmanship`; `yamaha-body`; `yamaha-choose`; `titebond-original`; `mohawk-instrument-2012` |
| b_release | unique first-release Q |Q is the sum of measured net complete instrument masses first quality-released once in the same declared configuration/cohort and moisture state. Closing FG already first released is inside Q and cannot be added as another output or deducted as manufacturing burden carry. Dispatch, return, reinspection or resumed shipment never creates Q. Manufacturing carry comprises only genuine raw/WIP/unassigned non-WIP stores with each inherited exchange vector. Preserve opening/closing raw and WIP, failed/zero-output runs, start-stop, idle, cleanup, samples and actual rework. Each opening and closing unused/unassigned non-WIP store must retain its actual physical quantity as well as every inherited exchange vector and origin; a vector balance never replaces that stocktake. | `yamaha-craftsmanship`; `yamaha-qc`; `ilcd-attributional-2010` |
| b_service | original-cohort factory-gate service | Record actual storage, handling, packaging, dispatch, returns and occurred post-release work under original Q_H and the observed H, never a new product denominator. Retain performed original-cohort service even if FG is held at closing; carry only unused/unassigned service or charge. Keep full opening/closing FG history and per-flow manufacturing burdens separately from current actual increments. A net-delivery alternative would require full gross G/R, original delivered-state reversal D_rev and burden bridge; returned wet mass is not guessed equal to original delivery. It is outside this first-release denominator. | `ilcd-attributional-2010`; `yamaha-qc` |
| b_physical | manufacturing FG and consolidated physical gates | Reconcile full wet opening stocks plus every actual gross external inlet to full wet closing stocks plus every actual gross external outlet. Manufacturing-to-FG Q is an internal handoff; pair/cancel it in the consolidated gate, never add Q beside closing FG and G/R. Gross physical quantities, packaging, assets, parts and water do not follow burden/economic allocation fractions. X_in/X_out remove only identical overlap with OTHER same-side inlet/outlet terms; new materials/water remaining in closing stock retain BOTH their actual influx and full wet closing mass. Already net stock-corrected consumption is never stock-corrected again. | `ilcd-attributional-2010` |
| b_pack | each actual packaging pool | For each actual article pool retain P/I/ER/S/EO/W and use full wet O + P + I + ER + F_in - X_in = C + S + EO + W + F_out - X_out. O/C include all empty, WIP/FG-attached, reusable and actual retained discarded/collected states belonging to that boundary, or an explicitly paired separate collection-stock subgate. F_in/F_out are independently measured actual additional repair materials, water/moisture ingress, removed parts, drainage or evaporation not already owned in whole-article events. X removes only the identical proven duplicate in an OTHER actual term on the SAME side, matching article/lot/event/species/unit/period and owner; card presence, closing stock, opposite-side flow, stock-adjusted burden or economic share never justify X. Whole wet articles or an exhaustive mutually exclusive component bridge are alternative representations, never additive. Internal handoffs/reuse cancel. One actual mixed external Waste total/provider has independently measured non-additive origin-W partitions of that same exit/state/period; if origin amounts are unknown, do not fabricate them. Actual separate outlets retain their own specific rows and treatment. | `ilcd-attributional-2010`; `yamaha-qc` |
| b_water_carbon | all materials water air and residues | Constrain whole physical mass and relevant elements independently. Keep wood biogenic carbon, fossil resin/coating/plastic carbon, ambient carbon and upstream forestry uptake distinct, with no automatic storage or waste-sale credit. Measure free/sorbed wood moisture, liquid/vapour/carrier/formulation water, structural water and independently evidenced reaction water separately. Ordinary storage/handling sorption and desorption are actual atoms and require no invented work permission. Glue drying and solvent loss do not establish reaction water. VOC/COD/TOC/PM and wood-dust indicators are not molecular species; one residual cannot determine two unknowns. Integrated gas/liquid volumes are not multiplied by time again; only real rates are integrated. Density must describe that substance and actual state. | `yamaha-craftsmanship`; `mohawk-instrument-2012`; `ilcd-attributional-2010` |
| b_work | all actual failures returns and postwork | Manufacturer/specification permission, postwork tests, acceptance and disposition govern actual rework and continued conformity. They never delete unauthorized, failed, held or unaccepted work that actually occurred; keep its full physical flows, load and original cohort with actual hold/waste. Broken wood/joints/coatings are not assumed restored. Ordinary manufacturing waste, samples, failures, external sale/removal and their treatment do not automatically subtract burdens. Only a real distinct other cohort/function and justified allocation/handover may receive one vector transfer; physical gross remains complete. | `yamaha-qc`; `ilcd-attributional-2010` |
| b_extend | actual missing atomic exchanges and providers | Before numerical use, add each real unlisted wood species/supply form, inlay, insert, fastener, whole preparation, separately added chemical, fuel, energy, water phase, refrigerant, package, waste outlet and real emission species individually. Never use an other-material/energy-carrier collection or absence inferred from query failure. Onsite manufacture of a supplied component/formulation requires every actual purchased material, energy and loss instead of repeating a whole provider. For thermal service preserve actual carrier kg, heat MJ, Product returns, state/enthalpy and supplier water-energy boundary; no invented steam or boiler. | `ilcd-attributional-2010`; `yamaha-craftsmanship` |
| packaging_receipt_basis | packaging | For each actual whole packaging article, P records paid procurement (standalone or bundled, with or without a separate invoice). I records first non-purchased external ingress, including standalone gifts, loans, rental/pool issues and unpaid supplier-attached packaging; supplier attachment is only one I subset. ER requires the same item or an auditable matching batch linked to this site's own prior outward record; another party's prior use alone is not a return. P/I/ER are disjoint. The existing matching physical-article cards and raw subledgers cover these origins subject to every native material/form/state qualification; incompatible actual articles require their own atomic rows, never a substitute UUID. F_in/F_out remain separate measured material/water-change terms, not a substitute for whole-article receipt. Keep gross wet quantities, owner/custodian, payment/non-purchase basis, provenance, prior-outward links, actual state/unit and inherited manufacture/service vectors. A free receipt is neither a new manufacture nor automatically burden-free: attribute actual service and incremental transport/handling once to the proper original cohort/denominator and retain genuinely unused service separately, without a default lifetime or credit. Stock, physical gross legs and burden vectors remain separate. This is the declared conserving foreground-accounting implementation, not a claim that the cited source prescribes these variable names. | ilcd-attributional-2010 |

## 6. Process Inventory Structure

Every description and applicable normative ancestor is part of the consumable rule. Each card is one actual physical/chemical article, preparation, species, event or explicitly non-additive service account. All six packaging legs have their own cards. Internal component/whole-instrument handoffs stay paired in the process ledger and cancel on consolidation without another external purchase or Q. Each card’s x_i and protocol aggregation refer to the single calc_quotient result in section 8. Collect only undivided raw records; full gross V and attributed burden/service vectors are independent dimensions. Conditional absence requires actual evidence, and all real missing atoms are added before use.

###### Treatment service for discarded pet transport strapping (`strap_w_treatment`)

Conditional actual treatment of the uniquely identified discarded pet transport strapping outlet. One real receiver/provider boundary, original unit and independently evidenced actual-state conversion; kg here is actual wet feed demand only when the provider supports it. A mixed outlet has one treatment service; pool W is not another provider purchase. If treatment occurs onsite, collect every actual material, energy, water and species instead of adding the whole service again. Sale/export/failure never automatically removes incurred manufacturing or treatment burden. When the associated article W is only an origin partition of a mixed outlet, this separate treatment service is not an additional activity; the sole actual mixed-outlet service owns treatment once. A real separately treated outlet retains its own activity.

##### Elementary flows

## 7. Allocation and Co-product Handling

| rule_id | Applies to | Rule | source_ids |
| --- | --- | --- | --- |
| a_subdivide | attributional method | Apply only where attributional allocation is justified by the study goal. First separate dedicated production and actual or virtual subdivision, directly assigning each uniquely related input/operation to the receiving instrument/cohort/function. Do not apply industrial manufacture literature as allocation authority or freely choose physical versus economic allocation. | `ilcd-attributional-2010` |
| a_causality | remaining shared exchanges | For every remaining exchange establish the determining physical causal relationship, using actual measured process mechanics, residence/operation time with the truly limiting mass/area/volume/capacity where needed. It may differ for each exchange; an entire factory or all materials do not inherit one arbitrary mass share. No fixed yield, time, machine life or allocation percentage is supplied. For each exchange, allocated vectors across all real receiving functions/cohorts must sum to its complete pre-allocation inventory; full physical gross quantities remain independent. | `ilcd-attributional-2010` |
| a_residual | true residual common-process functions | Only the demonstrated residual lacking subdivision and determining physical causality uses actual contemporaneous market values of real co-functions at the same common-process gate and actual exit condition. Document why residual and common gate/state apply, price period/unit and sensitivity. Ordinary offcuts, failures, samples or treatment exports are not automatically another function. No automatic displacement credit, negative purchase, waste-sale credit or repeated transferred vector. | `ilcd-attributional-2010` |

Preserve new/used actual material/water influx even if still held; X only deduplicates another in/out term. A plank is not the whole pallet; integral parts inside received whole articles are not bought again. Failed/unauthorized occurred repairs retain all loads and disposition. No quotient.  Apply b_pack real-F and exact OTHER same-side X rules; retained influx is not deduplicated against stock.

Use wet kg demand only if justified by its actual provider; no invented conversion. Mixed pool W is not another provider. Onsite treatment collects each actual input/energy/water/species instead of repeating a whole service. Ordinary waste sale/export does not remove incurred manufacture/treatment.

### Calculation Rules

| rule_id | Applies to | Formula or rule | Inputs | Output | source_ids |
| --- | --- | --- | --- | --- | --- |
| calc_q | finished_guitar | Q = sum of actual measured net complete first-release instrument masses from the same cohort/configuration; each unique instrument once. Packaging and independent accessories excluded. Closing released FG is already in Q. | actual_net_masses; cp_release | Q | `yamaha-craftsmanship` |
| calc_raw | all inventory rows | Convert original units once before stock/ownership accounting; integrate actual rates only. 1 kWh = 3.6 MJ. Density and thermal state must be measured for that substance/state. Keep gross V and burden vectors distinct; preserve full wet closing stocks and every actual influx. | raw_records; cp_util_m; cp_util_h; cp_material | converted_raw | `ilcd-attributional-2010` |
| calc_attribution | all inventory rows | For manufacture, A_m_i = B_open_i + U_i - B_close_raw_WIP_unassigned_i - T_other_i after real unit conversion/subdivision/exchange causality and true residual allocation. B_close excludes first-released FG. Each inherited vector and real unassigned non-WIP store stays explicit; already stock-corrected U is not corrected again. T_other exists only for a true distinct function/cohort with justified one-time handover; ordinary failures/waste/sale/treatment are retained. | converted_raw; raw_WIP_inherited_vectors; actual_other_function_decision | A_m_i | `ilcd-attributional-2010` |
| calc_service | all inventory rows | For original cohort Q_H over actual H, A_h_i includes actual fulfilled storage/handling/packaging/asset/treatment/postwork increments and any genuinely assigned unused opening charge, minus only unused/unassigned closing service/charge and a justified one-time real other-function transfer. Never subtract performed service because FG remains held; do not import historical manufacturing vectors as new purchases. Physical gross V is never replaced by A_h_i or an economic share. H is the actual observation window, not another divisor. Already accumulated A_h_i or gross V_i is divided by original Q_H only through the sole quotient, never again by H. | actual_service_records; original_Q_H; H; single_owner_vectors | A_h_i | `ilcd-attributional-2010` |
| calc_quotient | all inventory rows | x_i = N_i / Q_c, once only. N_i is A_m_i for manufacturing load, A_h_i for actual service load, or FULL actual gross leg V_i for physical-only disclosure. Q_c is Q for manufacture and the original Q_H for observed service/gross legs; no new product Q. Each dimension remains separate; physical V has no stock correction/allocation fraction or second provider/credit. Q_c = 0 retains raw numerators and physical flows with no unit result. Cards and aggregation reuse this same x_i without redivision. | A_m_i; A_h_i; V_i; Q; Q_H; cp_release | x_i | `ilcd-attributional-2010` |
| calc_physical | all inventory rows | For each gate reconcile full wet opening + actual external inflow = full wet closing + actual external outflow, with independently measured species/elements/carbon/water constraints. X_in/X_out only deduplicate another OTHER same-side in/out term, never retained influx. Pair/cancel internal instrument/component handoffs; packaging whole article/tare/content and components are disjoint; source-pool W sums to a real single mixed outlet and is not added beside it. Apply the explicit F_in/F_out versus SAME-side OTHER-term X definitions in b_pack at every applicable gate. Distinguish measured origin partitions of the actual exit from precollection discards: retain collection opening/closing wet stocks and every actual disjoint addition/loss, cancelling internal transfers once. Unknown partitions remain unresolved rather than fitted to one total. | raw_physical_stocks; gross_V; independent_species_constraints; overlap_bridge | closure_findings | `ilcd-attributional-2010` |

### Data Quality Requirements

| requirement_id | Applies to | Requirement | Evidence |
| --- | --- | --- | --- |
| dq_identity | all rows | Keep actual supplied whole identity, native constraints, grade/form/phase/route/geography/medium/type and provider boundary; blank UUID never means a collection label or zero. | supplier primary records; exact native original; approved BOM |
| dq_measure | raw readings and Q | Retain calibration, net/gross/tare distinctions, uncertainty, actual moisture/density/thermal state, original units and rate/integral evidence. Future quantities remain collection requirements, never invented factors. | calibration; raw meter and weighing; actual sample records |
| dq_complete | whole cohort and H | Include every operation, first release, failure/idle/cleanup/sample/rework, raw/WIP per-flow vector, FG history, packaging six events and assets/service/treatment owner. Retain actual unknowns and coverage limits; no inherited approval. | complete raw logs; vector/stock/event bridge; source scope |
| dq_acceptance | actual work and downstream use | Manufacturer/spec permission and actual posttests/acceptance/disposition determine conformity, not whether occurred physical load is recorded. Technical source synthesis is neither a certified factory inventory nor science/translation approval. | actual approved specification; permission/test/disposition; review metadata |

## 9. Validation Rules

| rule_id | Applies to | Rule | source_ids |
| --- | --- | --- | --- |
| v_terminal | reference and all inventory rows | Require the whole declared non-electronic six-string all-solid acoustic terminal, approved configuration/BOM and real first-release record. Whole-string-instrument native Product/Mass plus positive whole-primary scope is required; wrong acoustic/electric, part/whole, CAS, material, grade, route, form, phase, geography, medium or type cannot be overridden by a name/CPC match. Missing auxiliary/provider/measurement evidence stays explicit and blocks only dependent numerical use; a genuinely missing core identity is a core hold. | `yamaha-fg9-r`; `yamaha-craftsmanship`; `un-cpc3` |
| v_quotient | raw quantities Q and all cards | All raw collection is undivided. Convert original units/rates and resolve real allocation/ownership before the sole quotient x_i=N_i/Q_c. Manufacturing uses A_m_i and Q; service uses actual A_h_i and original Q_H; physical-only cards use FULL actual gross V_i, not A_m/A_h, stock-corrected use or economic share. Cards and aggregation reuse that same result without another quotient, purchase, provider or credit. Q_c=0 retains all actual raw/attributed numerators and physical flows without a unit result. Future unknown records cannot be claimed measured or passing. | `ilcd-attributional-2010` |
| v_balance | physical and burden gates | Check independent gross wet mass, relevant elements, carbon origins and every water state across manufacturing, FG/service and consolidated gates. Verify per-flow raw/WIP inheritance, unique Q/closing-FG bridge, all six actual packaging events, assets/parts/fluids and disjoint whole/component/mixed-Waste bridges. Preserve retained influx and full closing mass together. Already net consumption is never twice corrected. | `ilcd-attributional-2010`; `yamaha-craftsmanship` |
| v_truth | sources native restrictions and review | Verify whole sources, actual applicable route/state and counterexamples, each source id/type/reference/use and rule source_ids, original native property/group/reference unit, exact Chinese official displays and complete consumable context. Conditions in descriptions/ancestor units remain normative. Engineering/schema/projection/finite measurement checks do not approve real factory quantities, scientific methodology, translation, accepted mapping, classification coverage or publication. | `ilcd-attributional-2010`; `yamaha-fg9-r`; `yamaha-choose` |
