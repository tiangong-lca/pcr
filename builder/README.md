# PCR Library Builder

This directory contains CLI tools, schemas, templates, fixtures, controlled vocabularies, and authoring documentation for maintaining the PCR library.

The builder treats classification systems as inputs and mappings. It does not make PCR records subordinate to any one classification system.

Public PCR consumption tools live under `packages/` and `skills/`. Do not add Agent-facing model-construction commands to `builder/cli/`; keep this directory focused on creating, updating, validating, and publishing PCR records.

## Directory Shape

Machine-facing and execution-facing assets stay directly under `builder/`. Human and agent documentation lives under `builder/docs/`.

```text
builder/AGENTS.md

```

- `builder/AGENTS.md` is the local agent routing and hard-rule entrypoint.
- `builder/lib/` contains builder implementation modules behind the CLI, including scaffold, lint, lifecycle, Markdown table parsing, and structured projection logic.
- `builder/docs/index.md` is the human-readable builder documentation map.
- `builder/docs/workflows/` contains task runbooks for creating, updating, translating, reviewing, and publishing PCRs.
- `builder/docs/contracts/` defines durable authoring contracts for Markdown, manifest, structured projection, evidence, and UUID references.
- `builder/docs/methods/` contains reusable modelling method notes that support the contracts.
- `builder/docs/tools/` explains authoring-time tools, Tiangong CLI lookup, and usable evidence sources.
- `builder/docs/prompts/` contains thin entry prompts for Codex, Claude Code, and PCR reviewers.
- `builder/vocab/` is the only hand-authored source for controlled tokens. `npm run vocab:generate` projects it into the shared runtime module and JSON Schema used by lint, core, and the public CLI.

## Builder CLI

PCR generation shares literature through `npm run pcr:materials -- query|read|register`.
See [Shared materials](docs/tools/shared-materials.md) for commands, registration fields, quality constraints and
shared-directory configuration. Goal Harness performs the initial bounded query before dispatch and passes the
resolved directory to each author task; this is source preparation, not a new review or release gate.

```

- `init` creates required scaffold directories and guide files.
- `lint` executes the JSON Schema contracts for the catalog, classification mappings, PCR manifests, bilingual Markdown frontmatter, and material structured projections. It also checks required repository paths, bilingual PCR directory completeness, lifecycle compatibility, process inventory structure, range coverage for important flows, and deterministic `structured.yaml` freshness for every material PCR. Candidate PCRs may pass with range warnings; reviewed or published PCRs fail when important flows lack ranges.
- `pcr:import:cpc` requires an explicit `--source` on every invocation. It imports raw CPC source metadata and
  normalized hierarchy, leaves, and paths; its default classification-only mode creates zero PCR records. It creates a
  zero-edge current mapping document only when no mapping exists. An existing mapping must validate and is preserved
  byte-for-byte in classification-only mode. Register a coverage descriptor before importing a non-3.0 version.
- Current classification mapping v2 files contain accepted positive edges only. Every edge targets a material PCR,
  excludes `manual_review`, and carries acceptance status, decision-maker, UTC decision time, and durable decision
  reference. Read the accepted set and count from `classifications/mappings/<system>-<version>-to-pcr.yaml`.
- `--legacy-scaffolds` is migration/test-only and may operate only on retained v1/scaffold mapping fixtures. A current
  v2 mapping causes it to fail before mutation, preventing unaccepted-edge injection and retired-directory
  rehydration. For a v1 fixture it may create one complete four-file target when absent; an existing target must be
  complete and byte-for-byte equal to the expected legacy template. Partial or divergent targets fail closed. The
  protected `pcr:scaffold:cpc` compatibility alias fails unless this flag is explicit. Never use this alias or flag
  for a new classification import.
- CPC imports hold a system/version coordinate lock, use no-follow reads and a baseline compare-and-swap check, stage
  each file replacement or complete legacy directory, and commit the mapping last. A preflight, concurrency, or
  installation failure therefore cannot leave a dangling new mapping edge, although already installed
  classification-only projections may be regenerated on the next run. Preflight rejects invalid UTF-8, non-empty
  incomplete rows, missing parent
  hierarchy, a parseable header version that disagrees with `--classification-version`, and a same-name retained raw
  artifact whose bytes differ. Successful output reports the import mode, row/node/leaf counts, mapping action, PCR
  count, and the next action. When source artifacts changed, it also marks coverage/catalog artifacts stale; review
  accepted mappings and run `npm run catalog:build` for a registered coordinate. Treat any retained-source,
  legacy-target, or template mismatch error as a compatibility risk that requires manual review; do not force or
  repair around it.
- `pcr:sync-structured` regenerates `structured.yaml` from canonical PCR Markdown, including boundary, allocation, validation, process-inventory rules, and deterministic projection metadata. `--workspace` defaults to `current`; published and deprecated current files are immutable, so an open revision must be synced with `--workspace revision`.
- Completed-output measurement checking recognizes the native count-unit spelling `Item(s)`, for example `1 Item(s)`. The declared reference, completed-output quantity and exchange unit must still agree exactly; alternatives and mismatches require review or fail the check. This syntax support does not verify a flow UUID or establish publication readiness.
- `pcr:check` checks one selected current or revision PCR without syncing files or reading shared catalog/mapping indexes. It reuses Builder inspection for lifecycle, bilingual alignment, projection freshness and finite measurement consistency. Exit 0 requires complete measurement coverage with `status: pass`; a conflict fails with `PCR_CHECK_FAILED`, and an unsupported relationship with `PCR_MEASUREMENT_REVIEW_REQUIRED`. Definite Schema, lifecycle or stale-projection errors take precedence when both occur. Use `--format human|json` (default human); JSON failures leave stdout empty and emit `{ok:false,error:{code,message,details}}` on stderr. Details identify rows/rules and checks skipped. General `lint` reports measurement findings as warnings so historical PCRs are not retroactively blocked or rewritten. See [Measurement rules](docs/methods/measurement-unit-rules.md) for supported bilingual forms.
- `goal:prepare-report` runs in the assigned clean author worktree after the four-file commit. For tasks pinned to authoring contract 2 it reads an absolute draft conforming to `builder/schemas/goal-author-draft.schema.json`, audits finalized receipts and direct UUID identity, runs actual PCR inspection and two deterministic syncs in a review worktree, then preserves draft/report/manifest in ignored Goal state. It fills only rejection fields and receipt membership; explicit UUID/decision/membership conflicts fail. Default JSON output is the submission envelope containing a hash-bound report reference. `--format human` is available for inspection. Identical inputs reuse the same reference; changed content, task/attempt/turn or evidence invalidates it. Independent intake still verifies sources and reruns quality/evidence/commit checks. See [Goal Harness](docs/tools/goal-harness.md#prepared-reports-for-new-authors).
- `pcr:lifecycle` validates manifest lifecycle transitions and runs a material preflight before a PCR becomes active. Use `--workspace revision` for revision review state. A published current record permits only the one-way transition to `deprecated/deprecated_methodology`; a deprecated record cannot be reopened.
- `pcr:bump` updates a valid semver only for an unpublished current workspace. It rejects malformed, published, deprecated, or open-revision state because a revision target version is fixed when `pcr:revise` opens it.
- `pcr:revise` opens one explicit `revision/` workspace from a managed published release, records a greater target semver in `revision.yaml`, preserves the consumer-facing top-level release, and marks the Chinese revision out of sync. It rejects deprecated and already-open records.
- `pcr:publish` first validates the proposed published manifest and freshly generated projection without writing. First publication uses `--workspace current --version <semver>`; later publication uses `--workspace revision` and the version locked by `pcr:revise`. Publication requires the complete identity contract, active reviewed methodology, reviewed non-empty Chinese Markdown with aligned normative rule ids, valid semver, and no unresolved review blocker.
- Every successful publication writes an immutable `releases/<semver>/` snapshot and appends `release-history.yaml`. Release metadata and the current manifest carry exact-byte SHA-256 evidence; lint validates the release chain, snapshot contents, projection integrity, and current-to-latest consistency.
- `pcr:sync-structured`, `pcr:bump`, `pcr:lifecycle`, `pcr:revise`, and `pcr:publish` replace the complete PCR leaf through a recoverable directory transaction whose state is stored under `library/.pcr-builder-state/`. `pcr:recover` rolls back interrupted pre-commit phases or finishes committed cleanup. Lock ownership is tokenized and keyed by filesystem-canonical PCR identity. `--force-stale-lock` is an explicit stale-lock/pre-journal-stage override, must not be used while a writer is active, and never permits guessing from malformed journal or unexplained tree state.
- `vocab:generate` validates every vocabulary source and deterministically regenerates the checked-in runtime constants and shared JSON Schema.
- `aliases:build` deterministically derives `classifications/aliases/pcr-id-aliases.yaml` from the retained CPC leaf
  identity inventory and current accepted mapping. `aliases:check` rejects stale output, duplicate sources,
  material-id collisions, alias chains/cycles, and invalid terminal targets. Read current membership from the
  generated registry and its verified count from `library/catalog.yaml`; lookup checks the registry before the catalog.
- `catalog:build` validates sources and publishes `library/catalog.yaml`, the material index, and registered coverage
  indexes as one journaled recoverable artifact set. The catalog pins the alias registry's canonical path,
  exact-byte SHA-256, and entry count; missing, truncated, or stale registry bytes fail closed. A pre-commit
  interruption is rolled back to the old set; a committed interruption finishes forward cleanup.
- `catalog:check` is read-only and refuses stale artifacts or unresolved transaction state. Use `catalog:recover`
  before retrying an interrupted publication. `catalog:recover -- --force-stale-lock` is only for a verified stale
  malformed/foreign lock when no writer is active; malformed journal or contradictory tree evidence still fails
  closed.
- `lint` rejects stale generated vocabulary artifacts before inspecting repository content; `validate` then runs lint plus tests.
- `goal:*` commands implement the recoverable local batch-production harness described in
  `builder/docs/tools/goal-harness.md`. Goal state is hash-chained under the ignored Builder state root; authors use
  durable visible Codex app-server threads in independent worktrees, and validated integrations land only through an
  exact-byte compare-and-swap. These commands orchestrate existing Builder contracts and do not replace them.

For the full workspace, release, transaction, and recovery invariants, use
`builder/docs/contracts/published-revision-contract.md`.

## CPC Product-Chain Planning Artifacts

`npm run cpc-chains:build` validates the reviewed source at
`builder/planning/cpc-product-chain-pilot.yaml`, derives repository-backed mapping, PCR-readiness, evidence, blocker,
and executable-wave state, and atomically regenerates `builder/planning/cpc-product-chain-pilot.md`. The generated
report contains the ready/blocked summary, chain diagrams, edge decisions, executable waves, review queue, and source
list; the command reports the rebuilt Markdown path.

`npm run cpc-chains:check` performs the same validation and derivation without writing, then fails if the generated
Markdown report is missing or stale. A successful check reports that `builder/planning/cpc-product-chain-pilot.md` is
current. Repository lint runs this check before the builder CLI lint.

These files are planning artifacts, not classification mappings or canonical PCR truth. A
`semantic_candidate` or official-source-only (`supported_by_official_source`) edge does not change an accepted mapping
and does not trigger PCR generation.

## Executable Contract Boundary

The builder and `packages/pcr-core` share strict JSON Schema 2020-12 validation for stable machine-facing
contracts. Validation runs without type coercion, default insertion, or removal of additional properties.
Schema failures are returned in a stable machine-readable shape with the contract id, entity kind, source,
and sorted field-level errors.

Classification mapping v1/scaffold remains readable only for compatibility fixtures. Repository current mappings
use v2/current, in which the positive edge and its acceptance decision are one strict contract. The coverage index
projects that acceptance evidence, and runtime resolution compares it back to the canonical mapping before selecting
a PCR. Retired leaf-derived identities are represented by a separate strict alias registry; an alias is a terminal
locator, not a mapping and not a new methodology record.

Authoring Markdown remains the canonical, flexible methodology source. Strict material projection validation
starts only after Markdown is compiled to `structured.yaml`. Surviving legacy scaffolds remain explicit catalog
compatibility inventory and are not required to satisfy the material projection Schema or fingerprint contract;
retired ids are not canonical create targets, and ordinary classification imports do not create new scaffolds.

For a material PCR, lint requires all four conditions together:

1. `structured.yaml` satisfies `packages/pcr-core/schemas/structured-projection.schema.json`.
2. Its `projection_metadata` hashes match canonical Markdown and the generated content.
3. Its full deterministic rendering matches a fresh builder projection.
4. Its stable shape contains the material methodology required for consumption, including identity,
   functional unit, reference flow, measurement, boundary, inventory, allocation, validation, and dataset
   profile content.

The consumption core repeats the Schema, fingerprint, and material completeness checks when it computes
readiness. Guidance and validation output are also asserted against their public JSON Schema contracts before
they are returned.

Explicitly created PCR scaffolds and migration-only legacy scaffolds use the current authoring skeleton:

- language-specific Markdown templates: `builder/templates/pcr.en-US.md.hbs` and `builder/templates/pcr.zh-CN.md.hbs`
- process inventory organized by process, then inputs/outputs, then product/waste/elementary flows
- UUID-only Tiangong references in PCR Markdown
- external data sources for literature, standards, official guidance, and non-default range evidence

Create workflows may use common sense to initialize candidate processes and likely flow lists, but final UUIDs and quantitative constraints must be backed by Tiangong lookup or cited sources. Update workflows are input-driven and should start from the specific user request, source file, reviewer comment, dataset, or database alignment change that motivates the edit.

The direct CLI entry point is:

```bash
node builder/cli/index.ts <command>
```


## Complete lint diagnostics

`npm run lint` (also the first part of `npm run validate`) keeps all existing
vocabulary, alias, catalog, CPC-chain and library checks. Its final library scan
uses explicit report mode:

```bash
node builder/cli/index.ts lint --report .reports/pcr-lint.json
```

The terminal shows exact error/warning totals and at most 20 abbreviated samples.
The versioned JSON report preserves every full diagnostic, counts, status and
whether collection completed. The printed SHA256 binds the full file. Reports
are replaced atomically only after writing succeeds; a report failure exits 1
and retains unsaved diagnostics on stderr instead of claiming success. Warnings
alone still exit 0, errors or incomplete collection exit 1. A lint pass is not a
claim that warnings or professional review requirements are resolved.

Report paths must be JSON filenames directly inside the selected root's ignored
`.reports/` directory. Filenames start with a letter or digit and may then use
letters, digits, dots, underscores or hyphens. Source/state paths, linked directories and linked/shared destination
files are rejected. A root path containing spaces or Unicode is supported.
Treat a previous report as historical until the current command prints its new
successful report location; an earlier vocabulary/catalog failure can stop the
pipeline before the library report is generated.

Direct `node builder/cli/index.ts lint` keeps its existing complete human output;
`pcr:check --format json` keeps its separate single-PCR validation contract.
No validation result is cached and no publishing/recovery command is invoked.

CI retains a validation transcript and, when produced, the current full JSON in
`pcr-validation-<run-id>-<attempt>` for 14 days, including failed validation runs.
A failure before the library scan is recorded as a missing report, not a complete
empty result. The workflow refuses pre-existing reports and preserves npm's
failure status. A successful validation command without its required full report
also fails CI. An early setup failure leaves the explicit not-started transcript.

## Offline distribution builds

Use `npm run offline:tool -- --output <new-directory> --version <tool-semver>` and
`npm run offline:library -- --output <new-directory> --version <content-semver>`.
The library build checks source contracts and stages an immutable English-only
SQLite snapshot. It does not change PCR lifecycle or authoring files. Read
[the distribution contract](../docs/offline-distribution.md) for packaging,
compatibility, licenses and offline installation.

## Material reusable method modules

`npm run module:sync -- --module library/modules/<group>/<slug>` regenerates one
localized material module. `npm run module:check` checks all localized modules;
optional `--source-packet` and `--ef-directory` verify actual selected source bytes
and represented method facts. `npm run module:export -- --module <leaf> --output
<new-file>` produces a portable review-bound JSON package. Explicit
`--allow-unreviewed` creates diagnostic candidate output only. Read the
[method module contract](../docs/method-module-contract.md) for review, consumer
pinning and authority limits. These commands never publish or change a PCR.
